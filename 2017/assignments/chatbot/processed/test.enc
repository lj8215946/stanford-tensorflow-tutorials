Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
You have my word.  As a gentleman
But
do you listen to this crap?
What crap?
I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  And you don't know how to quit?
No
Great
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
Hi, Joey.
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
Patrick -- is that- a.
What if she never starts dating?
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
So they tell me...
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
What about him?
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
Her favorite uncle
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
Where ya goin?
You just said
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
Nope - just came by to chat
He always look so
You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
hey.  Great show, huh?
Excuse me?
I say, do what you wanna do.
I know, just let me sleep
I told you
Why?
Start a band?
Who?
Unwelcome.
So what did I have an effect on ?
C'mon.  It's not that bad
Put your right foot there --
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
Good call.
So what's your excuse?
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
What?
Oh huh
I thought you were punishing me.
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Parts of it.
Which parts?
Macbeth, right?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
He's the devil's child...
He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
I know.
Can't you stay with us a little?
What...?  Do I have so many already?
All I have to do is call the guards.
Chief knows.
That's what it says.
How can you be so certain?
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
Colon!
We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.
You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
You bloody...
He must be replaced.
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.
Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
Your mother was blind?
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
I will if they don't send me back.
I can't take you to my place.
What are you asking me?
I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.
They're not gonna send you right back.
Who did cause and origin?
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.
Chief - mind if I take her?
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
Yeah, right.
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
Takin' a bath.
Any I.D.?
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
No.
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
No, what is it?
Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
My folks are.
You goin' to the escort service?
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get, they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
Then do it, asshole.
How many victims are up there?
No.  Tell me what you want to say.
I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.
You promise?
Yeah.  I promise.
Thank you.
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
Ready?
Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
Let her go!  Let her go!!
Two weeks holiday.
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.
Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!
Why not?
You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?
Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
Emil???!
Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!
I can get you a job.
As a plumber?!
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
Isn't he a little moody?
I'm trying to tell you.
Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
No.  Go ahead.
Well, he killed my partner!
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
Clean?
What?
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
Sure, what is it?
Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
I guess it isn't.
You're kidding.
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.
The antenna has to be replaced.
CONINUED
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
I'm having a party tomorrow.
When are you coming home?
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
Yes, Daddy.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
And your charming little daughter?
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
That's true.
Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
How about chargin' the battery?
Pay money?
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
I hear you've got visitors.
Would you guys...
You got a name, cop?
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
Yeah, right.  You want to try again?
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
Thanks.
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
Billy Bear...
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
That's the way I see it, too.
Call me later.
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
You're impossible...
Stall.
You want to go outside?
This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
What're you laughing about?
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!
Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
What mission?
Don't you open your messages?
...Shit!
Uh...
I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.
You're nothing but a... a...
I told you not to read all that crap!
I'm so tired...
Tell me...
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
Drink!
You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?
Okay, I believe you.
Don't...
She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.
Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?
You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?
Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.
We do.
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
What the fuck are you.. ?
What the fuck do you want from me?
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
Keep moving.
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
Remember me?
So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now, that is.
I'm telling you it's not that.
I told you I can't, not yet.
You don't have any other choice.
I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...
I'm here.
For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
No.
They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
It got to be too much for him.
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
How... how can you say that to me...?
What is this?
Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.
You alright?
It was bad.
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
Then what else can we do?
Rick, please.
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
I gotta get out of here.
Hey...wake up.
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
Okay, babe.  What's the matter?
You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream.
You're right.
And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
I've got to write some of this down.
Then get out!
Who's Jacob?
Whoa, slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?
They think I'm nuts.
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
Bottom line, Alice.  Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.
Mark...
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
You could train someone else.
Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
So they caught up with you, too?
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
You've got to let us try, Skipper --
'Us?'
You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look.
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
Is there any way out of it?
What about down?
Course and speed?
What course, Skipper?
Excuse me, Skipper---
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?
Right <u>at</u> him?
Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!
He did!
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.
Are you alright, Wade?
Always has been.
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.
You don't believe me?
Twombley involved?
What are you boys up to?
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Oh.
Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
Really.
Yeah.
No brag. Just fact.
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
Where'd Twombley get shot?
Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
Yeah.
Did you do that when you were a kid?
It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
I bet you did lots of bad things.
Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
Yes.
How about a Big Mac?
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
Where's the plow?
What's the hurry?
Yeah. A few things.
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
So?
Want to buy?
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
Maybe.
Good. Who?
You okay?
I'm sorry about what I said.
Tonight. Let's get together.
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
Think they're alright?
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
Just do it.
Where's Ma?
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?
Love! I'm made of love!
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
Wade, are you alright?
I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.
You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.
When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.
I don't drink coffee.
How was...  ...the ballet?
Daddy...
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
It's cut.
Got it.
They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel.
Sir, you threw out page two.
Can we do that?
Where are we now?
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
*                     Please tell me your name.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
Yes
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
Four...
Stop.
The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.
We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back.
Call Petrov...  I'll be back.
Flying the plane.
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
But...
This is the President.
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
You give me ulcers.
Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review the Iraq situation.
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
Forget it.  I was reading.
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
Felt like a large asteroid.
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.
Sir?
His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.
If that's the way you want it.
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
I'd use the word insane.
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
I'm so excited, Simon.
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
Simon, what's happening?!
My career is shot.
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
Scraps.
Yeah.
He's carrying a bomb.
Whenever your're ready, Captain.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
Yes.
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.
Surely there must be something you can do.
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.
That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
You got a telegram from head­quarters today.
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?
William Harcourt?
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right?  Whatta you care?
Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
Nothing.
Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.
Why'd I do what?
Screw you.
Human children can be very beautiful.  Getting married?  Congratulations. You will be taking Sunday off, then...
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.
No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
I'm going home.
Please, I must get out here.
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
No secrets, goddammit!  You don't hold back from me.  Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!
Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
Uh, George...
Ss'kya'ta'.
One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?
But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.
Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.
You did okay, Bishop.
Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
I hope you're right.  I really do.
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
Sir?
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found another way in, something we missed.
Locked.
Think of what?  We're fucked.
Range twenty meters.
Cross my heart.
Yes, there are, aren't there.
Don't go!  Please.
Why won't you check out LV-426?
Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
Indeed.
What's that?
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
How was I? Tell me honestly.
Is her mother still lying on the floor?
No, she's fine.
Don Giovannnnnnnni!
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
Now?
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
Eat
No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
Well, don't do that again!
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
What's the matter with you?
Well, ask her!
Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -
Why not?
That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
I see.
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
Alone.
I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
Hey!
Upstairs.
Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.
I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
Who told you this, Majesty?
Well, yes, I admit it is.
Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see.
Is she not here?
What's that?
You don't have secrets from me.
Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
Is he working?
What?
Sublime! Utterly sublime!
Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them.
'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
I'm afraid I am.
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.
So you are. How is your pretty wife?
She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't.
No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?
With all my heart, Mozart.
I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
No, please.
The doctor thinks I am. But -
Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
Consigned to flames of woe.
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.
Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?
I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!
But not his body.
Yes?
Exactly.
Ballet? What ballet?
What do you mean - now?
Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
Go about your duties.
Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
What do you dream about?
How old are you?
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
Now I'm embarrassed.
I'm a werewolf.
Closet.
Charming.
There is only one bed.
Yes?
Tomorrow is the full moon.
Let me go now, you'll make me late.
Anything.
Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!
Don't you remember?
Hello, Benjamin.
Feeling better?
Officer, I killed those people last night.
No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
What are you going to see?
How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
The Slaughtered Lamb?
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
I assume full responsibility.
Okay.
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
I heard that.
I don't know. Come on.
It's moving.
Where are we going?
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
Rudy Levine the shmuck?
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
You don't have to say anything.
I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
Hello.
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
Campari and soda would do nicely.
Do you have any hot soup?
No, thank you.
Hello, Tom.
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?
Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?
Where you been?
Say, you know, I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. You've got to hit with the left hand, and from the inside out, it's the only way you can hit anything—
I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?
The depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you. You thought they were your friends. Why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them?
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
We've been waiting fifteen minutes—
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, don't you?
I'm sorry, Dude, but—I—
That don't do us any good.
But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
Doesn't that come next?
Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.
No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals—  I think I will have a drink.
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
Shall we let the people come in?
If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man!
Yes, of course.
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?
Oh!
Mr. Sampson . . .
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
No, sir.
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
My wife? What's she got to do with you?
They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.
Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson!
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
He's at a board meeting.
The ten dollars.
All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...
You turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at twelve and emptied the boxes, didn't you?
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
This is healing?
Gatling! They've got a Gatling!
Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
How?
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
I ain't done --
I swear --
They came up, made the same offer they made you folks. Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off, one of those detectives hit him in the head, knocked him out. Cole lost his temper.
How many of them did he kill?
All right, settle down. All this money ain't ours.
I think I recognize you.
Because we were good at it?  Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.
What are you saying?
Bob, rip up some bandages.
Well?
Cannon or Gatling?
Strategically.
Of course!  Uh, sir?
You 'um big lawman?
-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee.
My little Web did that?
What do you say, sir?
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
You're doing just fine.
All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me.
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.
Y'know, Uncle Frank...
...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
Did you kill Yankees?
A fair number, Ma.
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
Teasing you is completely unfair.
Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.
I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby.
But I like the presidential suite.
You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me.
That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.
Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
I just though you were awful cute.
Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.
A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.
"The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!"  Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!
There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
I can't.
Is that Donald Trump's car?
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
I'm ignoring you.
Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
You and...Luis?
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...
So, you're looking great, how have you been?
He has a great body
Are you using minoxidil?
You're really serious, aren't you?
Are you sure?
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
No, you...didn't?
Maybe it's just the light.
Dorsia, yes?
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
Patrick?
That is...if you're not doing anything.
You didn't give them a name.
No, not really.
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
Jean? What?
I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.
So, what do you do?
Welt...it depends, why?
Well.
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.
Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  Not on "Page Six" at least.
Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay?
How old are you?
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.
You sure?
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
I've questioned him.
But Marcus denied it?
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 
I'm so hungry.
Speak up. Come on.
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
You think so?
You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
...But?
That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.
What!
Teddy was killed last night.
You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when --
Milo --
I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself.
Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
Right. Wait. A toast.
What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.
You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show.
Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
Conglomerates're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites. They'll pay him a huge premium to get on-line.
...Hello?
Oh. Yeah.
The wrong place?
...Worse?
That's great! Thanks.
Gary, I --
What?
All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools.
You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay?
Cool!
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
That's great. I -- didn't know.
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
The dishes are juiced up, too.
He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.
Please don't go.
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
She's a programmer?
Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
I could get it out of him.
You may.
Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
Or sometimes not at all.
To my health.
You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.
You mean Mrs. Kensington?
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.  There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.
Thank you, Exposition.
Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
My wedding tackle.
Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?
Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
Only sailors use condoms, man.
Out and about, doing odds and sods.
Not a good time to lose one's head.
I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
I love you, Austin.
That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
It says here, name Danger Powers.
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
Shut up.
My son?
They're mutated sea bass.
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is.  Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.
What did you say?
Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.
You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's turning quite nasty. Sir August was blown to smithereens. Along with half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's worried.
Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
The result would be ...
Then what's stopping you?
Much better.
My father always wanted a boy.
Do you?
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
June, July ... August?
I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.
You mean my other self ...
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
Is that written in his shoe?
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
Is that what you think?
What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?
Barely.
Because you always obey orders ...
I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
Very well. I have a friend who might be of assistance. He's at the Ministry. We'd better be careful.
What's that you're wearing?
English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...
You don't believe him?
Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...
How did you guess?
Weather's turning nasty.
Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately --
Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
One shot -- for emergencies.
Rules are made to be broken.
What's happening?
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
Cole...
I'm marrying Debbie.
Oh, come on, just a little.
Great car.
Thank you, sir.
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
But how can I do that?
Thanks for the advise, sir.
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
Let go of me!
This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
Are you sure this is a good idea?
I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.
Why is Cole here?
A strange wang right in my palm.
Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.
Really?
Ha, ha, ha.
Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it.
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.
Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
Hey, you guys...
Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
Let me take the lead, Stephen...
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
Hey! You don't know me --
So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.
-- C'mon, Stephen.
Hey.
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
I saw it.
I know.
I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.
Anything else?
What are we going to do about this?
Jennifer.
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.
I think your boss is going to need some spin control.
I don't have the slightest idea...
I'll see ya around, huh?
Who's doing this?
I don't have a story.
Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.
In a word, Brian, what is this job all about?
And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.
Then who wrote the report?
Did I say thanks?
No.
So what do you want me to do?
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
Fireman shit?
We gotta roll, Stevie...
Sorry I hit Jackson.
He's out.
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
Yeah? When was the last time?
Anyway, down here, take a look...
See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.
Who's this?
You don't know him.
What do you listen to, Stephen?
Alderman Swayzak.
What's to believe?
Yeah.
First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that...  First time shooting up?
Yes.
So what are you doing here?
There. Now you've got your profit and more. You'll have more product day after tomorrow, right?
You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
I forgive you.
What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.
You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids --
Yes, Sister?
Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint.
C'mon.  It's easy.  It's the same thing y'all do out at the Yankee game, no different 'cept we changing one word.  Everybody go it?
I didn't mean to scare you like that.
Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's his name again?
What do I do?
Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
Yo, check it.  This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me.
Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
And I'm the feet.
Trust me.  Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other.
I would like to change your name.
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?
I don't know about that plantation angle.
I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
I didn't mean that, in life.
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
Hello.
What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest.
The Jolly Nigger Bank.
Is that good or bad?
He, I'm Mona.
Hi, Mona.
I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
Yeah.
It looks delicious.
Mommy, please don't call me that.
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
He wants you to come and see him.
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?
You've never had any formal training, either?
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?
Money and nothing else?
Y'know my lady Lucindy?
So when are you comin' to pick us up?
...then what about...
That's what I like about you and me. We git along...
Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?
The good stuff.
Gots no intention of ending up broke.
Aw, c'mon.
Why don't you answer?
I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?
You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?
Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off.
Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
Yes, sir.
I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.
I have faced that problem before.
I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady.
Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
Then you yield to me.
But, for a time... a passing fancy?
Not one.
Have you not a man whom you value?
Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.
I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases.
I feel the ribbon.
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?
As much as possible.
Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?
Yes!
I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance.
I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?
I see.
Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.
Is he all right, papa?
Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
Sir, let those laugh that win.
You framed-him...
Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.
We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike?
He's lying.
He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
What business?
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.
We just want to check your pack --
Right?
That's exactly what he says about you.
Look in my pack.
What don't you know?
No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"
This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator.
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
Who killed Pike?
You mean not enough to save you.
It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.
No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.
Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar.
Excuse me?
That is the most unprofessional --
You made me look like an idiot --
Why do you care?
I didn't shoot West...
What?
At least you and Kendall agree on that.
Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.
And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you --
You're a good man, Hardy.
Do I have a choice in this?
What are you doing out here?
Pike and I got separated --
I was freezing from the hurricane --
No one else heard it?
What happened with Nunez?
We all know what you did, Pike. I don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here, but --
What do you think?
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Welcome to ya. What's your name?
You were expecting me?
What is this place?
Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate.
You get the eye?
How long have you known my father?
How would you describe him?
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
You're pretty good at arithmetic.
No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.
I was dreaming.
That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else.
Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
What's your name, Giant?
You don't like it?
What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
What did he say?
Dad?
Son?
Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
Really.
'Fraid so.
I'm going with you.
That's because most of it never happened.
Mmm.
Is he awake?
You can see why it's sensitive?
I'm asking what you're here for.
I need to know who you are first please.
So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?
I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
You're asking for my documents?
What was that?
Oh nothing.
No. It's not that.
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
Yes.
Yes.
Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.
So what are you going to do?
Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.
Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
What?
What?
Oh Jesus.
I don't want to talk about it.
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.
Sometimes.
What?
It wasn't what I wanted.
I don't have nothing.
Have you had any before?
It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
You can probably buy them on the flight.
What does it mean?
Is your niece older than 12?
Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over.
More cough syrup?
That young lady's size, right'cher.
Holy shit.
She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
Jes? Jesse?  Oh shit... Wait... Wait... STOP!
Laz... You can't say nothin'...
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
Or what? OR WHAT?
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
Teh... Tehronne?
You been in and out goin' on two... maybe two days.
Don't need none.
Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.
Gal, you ain't right yet.
You some kind'a pervert?
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
In my house, you watch that lip...
I said... STOP!
My Daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. That's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. Know why it's best to rotate em like that?
Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?
Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. And let me tell you...
We drinkin' buddies now?
By myself?
Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?
You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.
What I love.
That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
I don't pimp that.  You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean Rae. Rae Doole. Sexy little split tail, like you say. I can't hook you up with that. I got two girls. One ain't in town, the other one pregnant. So... you on your own.
You collar that dog, boy. I ain't gonna hurt nobody. Just wanted to know who she was.
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
What'chu sayin'?
He tapped that.
Naw!
You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I expect you to come.
Pass them potatoes, Lincoln.
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
There you go, preacher man. Get me drunk so I don't stick my foot up yo ass.
Heard about this morning.
You a preacher?
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
You feelin' sick?
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.
Ronnie. Please, baby...
Got in a little accident.
The hell you call me?
Hey, hey, where you goin'?
Back-up.
Get rid of it.
Why?
It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise me?
Frank Abolofia.
What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
Not a prayer.
I just want you to know... I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me.
Let's grab some food.
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.
What does Ichiro mean, anyway?
Give me a break, would you?
... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
What's he saying?
We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.
Where does this Sugai live?
You did great, Ichiro.
I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.
Joyce?
Thank you.  You have one?
What's that for?
You have a helluva way of asking for help.
Don't be an ass.
I've heard of Sugai.  I've also heard of the emperor.  They're both national treasures.  One's a hood.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
I'd invite you up but I know you'd hate the incense.  I chant.
They want your autograph.
Might be different in New York.
One guy do all the damage?
Yeah.
Why?
It's not your job.
They're blaming it on you.  Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner!
I want a gun.
With these?
He knows what he's doing.
One man.  He must be good.
Then go get him.
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
And what can he do for you?
Would you like to be modified?
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...
Of course not.
He could?
Just thought I'd...
What's going on down there?
Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
It's okay.  Forget it.
But I would like to buy you drink.
Prosit.
No rust?
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
You sure?
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
What's suck night?
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
It's a good job.
Are you apprehensive?
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
What do people do in the afternoon?
Yeah.
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
You know what I think?
Thanks.
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
No.
Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof.
What?
We scared each other pretty good didn't we?
You look... better.
Beautiful.
Ah, you get hold of your friends?
As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.
Hi!
Oh, now, that's a great one!
Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
My office.
How do you do?
Are you French?
I just had a mental picture of...
I came on a bus.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!
What is it?!
Perry?
I can't, it's yours.
I think it's the eyes.
Watching television in color.
Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!!
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
Name it.
Then forget it.
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
I didn't know that.
It didn't used to be that way.
Never drive again!
Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?
May I please be excused?
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
I'm leaving, too.
But, Eve, I would--
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
My pleasure.
Really?  Okay!
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
Are you all right?
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
The nocturnal flying mammal?
Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em!  "No, we didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor us!"  I bet they've even asked the West for aid!  Right?!
I love Lucy!
I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
So, did you buy a movie?
Bye, Adam!
You dial nine to get out.
Are you in trouble, son?!
No.
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
Yeah.
So...you...survived the blast, did you?
The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
No.  They all do.
I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
What's that noise?
I'm not hungry.
No.  I think it's just right.
Right here!
Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.
Hi, honey!
Calvin!
You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
Yes.
They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I just can't.
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!
Well, that's blunt!
Always good advice.
Go to the bathroom.
What's that mean?
In the first place, I don't fall in love with weirdos I've only known for four or five days.
Or have perfect table manners.
What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?
Oh, no!
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.
You did? A human ear?
Is Sandy part of this?
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
Not yet.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Jeffrey nothing.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
Falling.
Do you like my body?
What do you want to do?
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
Do you love me?
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
Yes.
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
Oh no.
MOMMY!
Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too.
Yes, but.
Can I feel 'em?
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Do you want the car?
He comes over to study.
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
No, you're right.
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
Yeah, how did you know?
What will I say when she comes to the door?
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
Yeah, but.
OK.
Are you sure?
You want to tell me about it?
I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
Actually. I've been in twice.
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
You were late.
I'm really sorry.
Shoot.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
You didn't tell him about me?
What is it?
Really. You want to dance with someone else?
Let's wait for some slow one.
Dorothy Vallens?
I don't know why we have to watch TV.
Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?
What did he bring him in for?
Up where?
Well listen, I know how my boys take ta scrappin' when they take ta drinkin'.
Any tips on where these guys may be?
Chest pocket.  Shit!
What did you do?! Fuckin'... what the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!!
Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco.
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit.
They got nothing.
Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
Well, the light caught the side of his face for a second. And it looked like he had a gray beard, maybe... late fifties, early sixties.
Would someone please come over here and...
Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!
"Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?"
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
Who did you kill?
He isn't to be touched.
Now, you will receive us.
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?
Twist of lemon!
How many bodies, Greenly?
This is some crazy shit, man!
Yes.
He's a nigger.
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
This is he?
It had an alarm.
Loop around real fast.
Where's the other stocker?
What about what that guy said?
I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
I keep it for emergencies.
What about them?
Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?
Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?
He needs to hire an attorney.
If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
I have an idea for that.
What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
You don't know how to hotwire.
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
I know that. But --
When'd you get back?
OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van. What time is it?
I don't think you will.
Yes. I do.
Go ahead, Bird Dog.
I don't know.
It's going back down.
Help me move him.
Wait for Kumar.
Where?
I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
Me?
Exactly. Woah.
I don't know. Sure, I guess.
Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the car.
You think I'm improving?
No, I don't mind.
Was Future Man adopted?
Yeah. Let's keep it --
Like silk?
Where'd they come from?
You don't celebrate til it's over.
I don't know about that.
If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one.
What are you talking about, Bob?
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
Where'd she go?
I'm going to take a look at this.
Hang on. This is important, Bob. Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation. The money and the people. You're responsible for the external situation. The streets and the getaway.
Way to go, Bob!
Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?
I'm going back.
Not bad.
Right. It was extremely stupid.
What's wrong with Applejack?
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
You got to have fun with it. There's no point if you're not having any fun. Would you like me to be there tomorrow?
Well, I think --
Mr. Henry?
John Mapplethorpe.  How are you. Hi.
And the Landy woman?
Leaving was a business decision. We're both rich, come enjoy it.
Let's talk about Conklin.
We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
May I finish?
So what's he doing? You believe him?
Did he say anything to you?
Sir...
And?
There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
It was staged?
Of all the people in the world, you're the only one I have anything to offer.  That's why I came here.
It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.
I have to go now.
-- car keys?
-- my coat -- but we should --
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
But you're sure?
He was at the campground yesterday.
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
You drive.
But you found another choice.
See that tram coming around the corner?
Who is Pamela Landy?
Abbott?
No. You never worked Berlin.
I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy?
Good luck.
Is it fresh?
So?
I don't want to leave.
But... what will you do?
An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
The Scots will fight for us?
His legend grows! It will be worse than before!
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
Rest, William.
I rest.
I don't want to be a martyr.
We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
Keep these. We're going too.
They're coming!
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
Thank you for accepting.
Thank you for inviting.
This night is too beautiful to have again.
Yes, you are. And you must wake.
It's battle I want, not talk.
Why did you?
The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
Who would do such a thing?
Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!
And you say he doesn't remember any of it?
No dances, just tell me.
We're gonna be late again.
You know the answer to that.
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
How long will I be in here?
Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
There must be a way to fix this.
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
What did you see? What did it look like?
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex.
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories.
Oh God... what did we do?
God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
Where... where are my clothes?
Might'a been nice.  Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.
Why's that?
Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?
But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me.
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.
That should buy you ten minutes at least.
Hey, what'd you do that for?
Huh?
I thought I was the bad guy!
My husband is with me, too.
I thought so. Where's your husband?
Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
And he is still willing to give you a visa?
Nobody ever loved me that much.
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?
How long can I afford to stay closed?
Goodnight.
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
I will stay here and keep on trying. I'm sure in a little while --
It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.
Yes, of course, we --
Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?
Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
No.
Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.
Ask me?
Yes.
Rick? Who's he?
I can't get over you two. She was asking about you earlier, Rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous.
What for?
Good evening.
Well, this might come in handy.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
No. It's all arranged.
I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
Yes. What is it you want?
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
Yes.
Is that all you wish to tell us?
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
What else, my dear Major?
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
Thank you. It is a pleasure to have you here, Major.
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
You see what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration, what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at once.
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.
Is that a serious offer?
The winning side would have paid you much better.
I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
Sam's piano.
Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you?
Then don't have a drink.
Fix raft first.
What are you doing?
Look, just slip off the raft.  The ocean would feel so good, the water's so soft and warm.  Take a little swim.  Sleep.
You quitter you quitter you quitter.
The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
As much as anybody.
I had it on the island with me.
He's your cute thing.
That's your dog.
There isn't any us.
Is that Jango?
What was inside?
So simple to say, so hard to do.
I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.
Anything else?
I am one lucky guy.
I most definitely say I am.
Doc, I'm not on the island.  I'm not on the raft.  I'm alive.  I'm so glad to be back, I can't tell you.  I just want out of here.
I used to drive one of those.  A long time ago.
It seemed like she had such a good time last time.
I've got all this back pay coming.  Why don't you let me get you a place in town?
I was making a point.
That's why you're a gambling man.
You're fucking dead!
This stinks really bad.
When I first showed up, I thought you'd lost your fucking marbles.
To life.
As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.
Only if you can afford it.
They just want you to hire some new help.
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
Dr. Homer Wells.
Better than I can!
I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.
Good night, kids. Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already.
Where's Mandalay?
You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.
People watched the movies in their cars?
You've seen only one movie? Which one?
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
What's the *medical* explanation?
Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?
Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.
Nothing.
*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!
"...did." Well, okay.
So many children. Are they all orphans?
Nobody special enough, Curly.
Her temperature is a hundred and four.
Did you know your mother better?
Did you grow up around here?
Did you bite it?
"Burma run" because you fly over Burma...
They're migrants.
What about the trees?
I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!
I'm stayin', Homer.
Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it?
Of course.
You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
What I mean is... I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here, Homer.
I think Wally will be fine, Mrs. Worthington--he seems indestructible to me.
What's that?
But you don't look very happy.
Who cares?
You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
They told me I was too old to serve.
Thanks for playing along. I just have to sit for a while.
So we've been meeting with banks all day. It's amazing how many ways they can say "no" without ever using the word.
Oh. Well, thanks for the drink.
The standard ten.
Know who I am, Jake?
Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake.
Your life flashing before your eyes?
Just the last three weeks.
We were back on.
Ten is standard, sir.
The red hair... It's bad luck.
Masters of our own destiny.
Moonan. Here. Shit...
That's it? What are you talking about? We can still do this!
It can buy you a new and better you.
Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You guy's pretty good?
Minus one.
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
That's more than you already owe me. What happens if you fuck this up?
Listen, Scooter --
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
We have work. It pays a lot. Unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up.
Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.
No, we never got busted. We were done with a shift one night, both a couple of Percocets down and I was telling Glenn about my boyfriend, about how we were thinking about doing it, you know? I was thinking about letting him be my first because I loved him.  What the hell was his name?
Glenn talked you out of it.
No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.
What about...
What do you want? An apology?
Your mess.
So this is our boss, right? He chases me and Miles out of his office and he's yelling and screaming, "You're fired! Your whole team's fired!" He starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo --
Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson.
I'm sorry. Nothing under Pearson.
Sorry. What?
Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big?
Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake.
It's not history.
Do you have any idea what those monks charge for that medieval torture?
You guys awake?
You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross- departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it.
This guy must have been a real pain in your dick.
You sell it.
Bullshit it's cosmetic! My fucking tooth was cracked in half. I made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity. The department's dental is for shit.
I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
High five.
But don't worry, I'm clean as a whistle. I only did S & M.  No blow jobs. No screwing.
I got scared.
The Indian rope-trick.
Three years, two months. March '93.
I'll try and make it.
Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
Not entirely.
It's not just inner beauty, is it?
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.
I've got a job.
450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
How did it go?
You're my conscience.
What about a drink on the way home?
Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.
That girl, she works at the casino --
You're entitled to your opinion.
You were talking in your sleep.
How did you know I was here?
You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
How did you hurt your hand?
That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.
I'm in trouble.
I owe a lot of money.
Who's they?
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
These people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after. They want someone they can be sure of, an honest dealer. That's the point. Not all dealers are honest. Mr Reynolds will never suspect you.
I want to go back to Cape Town, I want to start again, clean.
Is it yes?
It's all relative.  I need the money too.
Do you?
Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.
Of course I recognised him!
Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating.
If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet.
You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.
Do you have a Salon Prive?
We do. 
Five.
What for?
Fine.
I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand.
The key!
It didn't go off.
Fuck that shit.
Well, it is kind of a long shot...
Well, there's the possibility of...
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
I am always receptive to suggestions.
Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
This is fun.
That's it.
Of course not.
Yes, well...
Hmmm...
Pinback...
Yes.
Which one?
Any of 'em any good?
Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.
-- open circuit breakers --
I need a diameter approximation.
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
The waves at Malibu and Zuma were fantastic in the springs Talby. I can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit...
Yes, Talby, what is it?
Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?
Yeah?
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop.
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
Who are you?
Or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is.
Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.
Ass like your, I can see why he's worried you'll punk.
Who's Camille?
How're ya doin', Max.
Why would I be pissed?
I was crazy about you...am crazy about you.  But you keep everyone at arm's length like there's some great big dark something going on that-- I don't know... It's just that the more I tried to get close to you, the more you pulled away.
So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife.
Where'd you clip this?
He's a mistake I made about six months before you did.  But don't feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke--
What's with you?  Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family.
Can you help me get her back?
Hello...
Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight--
So this guy walks into a bar and says...
Lauren's not my wife.
Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.
The technical term for you is "chimera"...
That's low, but this effects me how exactly?
They've lost track of me and I plan to keep it that way.
I'm sorry.
Well, not me personally.
These girls, kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder.  The oldest is twelve.  The youngest about the same age you were when you escaped.
A friend of your fiance's.
Who are you?
Look, I don't know what you want--
Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?
I asked you to keep that thing outside.
My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now, you got something for me or not?
He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners.  This kind of search...it's heavy spadework.  I'm gonna need--
As long as you're okay.
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.
Yeah, I can see to it your winning streak continues.
She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
You get it when I get her.
Playing hooky again?
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.
She tells you how I've been--
She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
I'll give it my best shot.
You rock, Max.  You... Rock...
Okay, okay, okay--
For a change.
More than anything in the world.
You're a little scrawny, but thanks to the concert we're low on amateurs. Name?
Jeremiah?
I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.
So. Is it true that Gene Simmons had a cow's tongue grafted onto his real one? Y'know, to make it so long?
I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.
Oh, great. I just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads... I'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno. Mind droppin' me there?
And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.
Now, how are we gonna do this?
Uh... dudes?
Could be.
Are you gettin' wise with me?
Jam, listen up.
What's gone?
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do.
I got...
Wait! I know how we can get in!
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
Grounded for the rest of the year?
I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard's. We're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot.
I said, I'm sorry!
I was insulted, so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? Then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me.
Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell.
Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!
The Chinese have a proverb: "That which appears too good to be true, usually is." There's gotta be a catch.
It's gone.
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
Twenty-five more'n I got.
Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
Two hundred bucks?
Oh, yeah! You and what army?
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
Is that your final answer?
Good morning...
GOOD MORNING!
Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity.
If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.
If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
"The Last Unicorn!" By Samantha Darko.
How can you do that?
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
Hey...
Wonder where we'll be then.
So, we call them... IMGs.
Infant Memory Generators.
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
Where is she?
Come with me.
Why? Is this about the book?
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
People aren't that simple.
It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?
I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?
I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
Who is the boss?
Four times... so far.
How does that make you feel?
Is Callie still around?
Whoa.  That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. I have sexual fantasies all the time too.
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
Because I'm so horny.
Thank you.
Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.
What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
What's her name?
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
Gerald.
Thank you for seeing us... We... just felt that it was time to discuss...
What I think is going on with your son.
Come again?
Frank?
Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.
Kitty...
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
You're what?!
Hell-no, she ain't quittin'.
Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.
Loretta, don't do that.
Amber? Here.
Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family only needs one "Liza" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me.
Huh?
Amber...
Oh, Mom, it's so ugly.
Go on! Get out!
Yeah...
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
Well, uh, I'm cuttin' out early today to do a little duck huntin'... but, uh, maybe I could call you tonight.
Yah-sure, fine... fine.
Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.
We was robbed.
Annette, just use your hand.
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
I'm a mirror.
That's right.
And the year before that?
So, remember the three most important parts of a good interview...
Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?"
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
The king can do no wrong! 
My dear President...  read it back...
"My dear"...
That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now?
There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got?
"My"...
I'll have to enclose the check first.
But you're my father -
Who to?
I wonder what's keeping His Excellency?
Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
What's the matter with you?
Hey you!!
Have you got a license?
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
I don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash -  Look - what do you call your dog?
I'm sorry I'm not in.  I wanted to have a long talk with you...  Now look here, my good man, you've got to stop yelling "peanuts" in front of the House of Representatives.
You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
If there was an open season for fellows like you, I'd get myself a hunting license.   Anyway, I'm going to make you a sporting proposition. You give up the peanut stand and I'll make you vice-president of the country.
Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.
Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.
You know, I'd be lost without a telephone.  Now - where were we? Oh, yes - I just made you Secretary of War.  The first thing you do is buy ammunition -- you buy it from me and I get 10% commission.
You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?
That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
With a gun like that you can kill some of your own men.
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
Chicolini, you've come just in time. We need a man who's fearless, brave. A man who's willing to die, if necessary.
The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride. 
When you get through with her feet, you can start on mine.  I haven't been to a chiropodist in two years...  If that's not an insult, I don't know what is.  Gloria, I love you.  I --
What I called you...  Why, what did I call you?
Was it -- swine?
Why - er - Mrs. Teasdale - this is an outrage!  This man is impossible... My course is clear...  this means war...  You RUNT!
Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
I wrote a speech last night that'll knock them off their seats...  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation --
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
But -
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
Mrs. Teasdale, I'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything I can to make up with his Excellency.
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know.
Yes?
I found it.
Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!
Now I think we really do understand one another.
Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you.
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional.
Oh, is he a friend of yours?
...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.
Oh yes?
How did you, know the rest? I never taught you the rest of it.
I don't understand.
Treves. Well done.
No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
How are you feeling today?
...I... everyone has been very kind to me.
What is it, Treves?
You never mentioned his mental state.
Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.
...Yyes
That's much better. I could understand that "yes".
Yes!
John... Merrick
Righteousness...
You look splendid, John.
Thank you very much.
How is your tea, John?
Yes, John?
My home.
Yes John?
I've heard.
No, he's very upset about something.
I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
A dressing bag.
Right! Where is he?
Those things in your hands.
What?
Where's the Cloak Invisible?
No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred will destroy us.
YOU still want to go to Asgaard?
Yes -- I believe you do.
There is something I must ask the Gods...
LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
It is day, of course, Freya.
Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.
Looting and pillaging, eh?
What -- rape?
Oh, get it over with.
You DON'T like it, do you?
Ah.
It's Halfdan the Black!
Erik! Row! What are you doing?
Let's hack her to pieces.
That's terrible!
What?
It's always the women that start the trouble.
SHUT UP!
Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
You'll be sucked down too!
There is another way.
Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard.
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
Hy-Brasil?
Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
My brother blacksmiths!
Wasn't it, Keitel?
We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt!
So did my father and his father before him.
Not now, Sven...
Shut up.
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
Yes, Mother.
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it.
No, it was lovely.
Oh, Tangerine.
Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.
Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
Joel? It's Joel, right?
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.
I'm not a stalker.
God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.
It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
That's scary sounding.
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
Yo ho ho!
Let me drive you home.
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
You're drunk.
No, it isn't that.
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
Such a beautiful view.
There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.
What was I wearing?
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
Egad, were you horrified?
I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:
I dropped you off after. You said --
It's very late.
Probably.
You said...
I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
yeah?
I think she's great.
Seems too coincidental that way.
Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?
Um, no.
What are you doing?
I think we should go.
What if you stay this time?
I think I should go back.
Make love?
It's true.
I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
That's me.
So then she just stops calling.
What? What do you mean?
I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
I hope you get your work done.
So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry.
Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right.
Definitely!
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
It's amazing, isn't it? Such a gift Howard gave the world.
It's stopped.
I don't know! I just said that!
The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
I have a family, Mary.
It was a mutual decision.
Ah, your journal. This will be invaluable.
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
I want to go back to the Clock People. I kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they're up to. What's happened to Jelly?
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
Tell me about it.
About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
You don't agree with Debbie, then?
So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
Extraordinary!
Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate.
For magazines?
To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you?
Your ranch?
I don't know anything about it.
Holy shit...
The containment, Second Containment...
Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.
It's holding... She's holding...!
Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
You weren't there. I saw it.
I'm telling you, I saw it...
Let me breathe, let me breathe...
To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep.
Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things.  I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close.
Hear what?
"Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.
What's wrong?
You wanted to see me, Admiral?
You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
I want our best people on this. Where's Miller?
Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on.
Patch me through to him.
Jesus its huge.
I found one.
I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.
Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.
Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.
Weir is dead.
Then who the fuck are you?
You're lying...!
Smith, where the hell have you been?!
Now what?
We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready.
It tastes bad.
The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio-readings of indeterminate origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels.
He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place.
Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
No. I saw nothing.
I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women...
Could it be the crew? If they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan?
Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.
Maybe a power interruption crashed the system...
The forward airlock.
I mean...
You look like an eighties rock band.
What did you wish for, honey?
Can't do it. I cannot do it.
Five times.
I had it at four.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
We're working as hard as we can --
What the hell you smiling at? Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
Hey! That's a prototype!
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
And where do we think we're going?
Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!
But all these people...
You're really cramping my style here.
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!
You two need a time-out.
And if he's not...?
You're happy for me and Victor.
Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
Didn't go as planned? It was a catastrophe. You ruined the lives of four people --
I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.
Reed's gonna fix me up --
Brad, can I talk to you a minute?
Of course.
Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again.
Well, I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here.
Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too...
I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.
Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
Your friends use the pool too.
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.
Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do.
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
Dad says you have to get up!
Hey! We came over to help you with Math homework!
Hey, Mike?
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
Do you ever look at those girls who work at Swenson's? They're beautiful. And I have to stand out here and watch them six nights a week.
You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.
That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.
If you ask me, she's pretty aggressive. You understand what I'm saying?
Jesus. I'm sorry.
Are you Linda Barrett?
All right, what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's.
School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
I hear you brought a film clip with you. Do you want to set it up for us?
My brother's car!
My brother is going to kill us. He's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us.
Just be glad you're all right.
Do you think guys find that attractive?
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
No. But it's a nice idea.
How long does Doug take?
Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.
Where's Doug?
Not coming? What happened?
He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
I think I've made my point with you tonight.
What's that?
If you graduate.
It's very warm out tonight.
We keep them.
I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
Anything to drink?
I checked the register for this man Thompson. We don't show him but I figured he might be part of your team.
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
Killed?
What happened? What did they do to her?
He wanted the pineal gland.
Hell, I really hate to hear this. Because everything that happens in California seems to get down our way, sooner or later. Mostly Atlanta. But that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful. All we had to do was to keep 'em under surveillance. They didn't roam around much... But now Jesus, it seems nobody's safe.
I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
God hell! I think I see the pattern! This one sounds like real trouble! You're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over. As your attorney I must advise you that you'll need a very fast car with no top and after that, the cocaine. And then the tape recorder, for special music, and some Acapulco shirts...  This blows my weekend, because naturally I'll have to go with you -- and we'll have to arm ourselves.
...and we're chock full of that!
Damn right!
Turn up the fucking music! My heart feels like an alligator! Volume! Clarity! Bass! We must have bass! What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies?
Shoot it.
Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?
Holy shit! They almost had us there! That was quick thinking.
Jesus creeping shit!
OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.
That dirty bastard! I knew it! He's got hold of my woman!
You evil son of a bitch. You better hope there's some Thorazine in that bag, because if there's not, you're in bad trouble.
How about a check?
Not me. It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it!
Jesus.
Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months. It's terrible.
I gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe. Also, I told him I'd be there myself in an hour, and if she wasn't, I'd come back out here and rip his lungs out.
That's good. You can't be subtle in this town.
Yes!
Don't take any guff from those swine. Remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People.
The password is: "One Hand Washes The Other." The minute you hear that, you say "I fear nothing."
I don't know what you're talking about!
Spare me.
Stop!
IS IT CLEAR?!
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
We shot a skunk.
Where's that?
We'll be food, dickheads!
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
What?
We're better off.
Yep.
What's in the back?
How are you holding up?
Oh.
Sure.
What? Really?
He only shot you once.
What's it for!?
Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
Fully.
Holds four.
Max?
Nine?
Look, the armed surround the unarmed in a circle and we move as a tight group. Those that can shoot, protect the rest to his ride.
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
Oh my God! Frances, I'm such a cad. I can't go through with this. My wife is in Europe, but this is her house...  her bedroom. I can't ask you to...
Huh.
The Group is more than a theatre company. It's the embodiment of an ideal. Our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense, a creative individual and an instrument of change. You see --
Frances.
What's up?
Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
Does Clifford even know?  You didn't tell him, did you?  I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
Get your clothes on.
GET OUT!
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
We're all square now, Harry. Right?
I know you believe that.
...I see.
We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
We'll get you home, Frances.
I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances.
He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
What do I do, Dad?
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
You're poisoning that child's mind.
Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway.
Kurt!
Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!
Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!
Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade?
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...
But I'm not. The newspapers're --
I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.
Quietly.
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason?
You know, the funny thing is: it's not a great movie. I mean it could've been, but they screwed it up, gave it a happy ending. And all my friends, I know they're going to smile and say they loved it.
Think I'll have a glass.
Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch.
What?
Whattaya think you're in now?
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?
Pretty morning.
You think I got it?
Mama...
Yes, Ma.
But they're using you!
It isn't in your hands, Mama. It's my life.
It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.
I think I need a little air.
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
Where are you going?
I'll have lunch ready by one.
Where are you going?
Yes...?
Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
I'll have someone show you to your room.
But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
Yes.
Then why weep for him?
I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
Yes. Very close
Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
I don't know.
Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
And if I consent?
Yes. I want this over and done with.
Why... her?
Are you all right?
Are you sure it can't hurt us?
I'll have to do better than that.
...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.
If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
So do I.
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
I'm quite serious. Look at all the charity and clinic work we do. Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of.
Only you would think of that!
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
You're making a scene!
I resent God's monopoly.
No. He had more important work.
Victor. This has got to stop.  Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended a single class.
I've been preoccupied.
What happened up there?
I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together.
Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
I tell you what we need, my friends. Forget the symptoms and diseases. What we need is a vaccine for death itself.
Are you a physician?
How is it you come to be here?
What'd you see?
Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
Any particular reason?
Alice? The others show up?
Oh, my God...
It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
How the... did he get in there?
Marcie?
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
Sure.
Claudette...
Holy shit...
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
Doctor. Now, if you were a flavor of ice cream, what would you be?
That's thirty percent.
I told you not to buy that hunk of junk!
Have you ever been there before?
You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.
You like the car?
Unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking, what say we drop this?
Have you forgotten about your sister?
They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us.
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
Sorry, I need everybody.
My wife.
Auto wreck.
Was? As in not anymore?
Yes.
No, I didn't.
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.
It's a flop house.
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
It has a bed. That's all I care about.
About two hours from now.
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.
No!
What?
Yes.
Yeah, we got a bible.
You're gonna let us go?
Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
Should I use the last bullets on us?
For the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty-eight hours. The Bureau, local law enforcement and the Texas Rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.
Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
Not even for lunch?
Were you giving that pig signals?
This is a private club. You're not welcome.
Start the car.
What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave.
I got both rooms on either side of us, so we don't gotta worry about eavesdropping assholes. How's that feel? You okay?
Hey, when you talk to him, see if you can arrange a better deal than thirty percent.
Did you even to try to negotiate?
No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
You just called me a fuckin' nut.
Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks.
Keep your voice down.
I did?
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
Really?
That's what you look like.
What do you mean?
They take you away to San Clemente Island.  Half the guys quit when they come back.  Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half.
Got it.
Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only --
I'm not out to change your sex, lieutenant.  You'll have separate beds, separate heads.  If you have specific medical needs, inform the infirmary.  If a classmate or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner, please inform me immediately so I can deal with it immediately.  Questions?
It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here.
I'm not sure what --
Newberry, get a photo.  South?
Yes, dear.
Would I be the only one?  The only woman?
Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --
Wickwire was there to help.  To be my eyes on the inside, to make sure you were getting a fair shot.  At least that was the intent.
You were never going to let women serve in combat.  You always had a safety net.  Or thought you did.
So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the reality gets you in trouble.
I'd go Special Reconnaissance. Every bit as tough -- and we have a 60 percent drop-out rate among the men.
It's really "F. Lee Montgomery" -- but that gets whittled down to just "Flea."  For short, ma'am.
Miller.  Thought the guy was made of depleted uranium.  Really didn't expect to lose him.
You don't think she'd be raped if she were captured?  You don't think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men?
I've had it.  Just because they pay me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean I'm gonna be one.
I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you to have it.  He was very clear on that point.
Unless you Whiskey Run.
Blank faces here, O'Neil.
That was good headwork, lieutenant.
Which is guy-speak for...
That bad?
Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
I don't know, I don't care.
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane"... Second run at Coronado... and correct, they had him stashed in the "Appropriation Liaison Office," whatever that is.
So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
Just askin'
If not, firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area.  Now how smart is that?
32 feet, six inches!
For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
Any brothers?  Sisters?
That your desk?  I'll take this one.
WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
Maybe we should call the Coast Guard.
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
The first female President?
Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day.  Know what I mean?
You okay?
Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?
I still can't believe it. How does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?
I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you.
If the military are listening, they must immediately destroy this building before they can escape.
Did Romeo have a name?
Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
Wish me luck!
He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
We did it! We've got the exclusive! Way to go, Audrey!
Well, I think you're cute.
We've secured the doors on both levels.
When we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone.
Right. The worm guy.  Can someone get those people off the beach?
What sample?
Somebody must have seen it.
Well, yes. I did. Clearly he was injured and bled.
You gave them the tape?
Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.
Sure.
What'd they say?
Who the hell are you?
Dr. Lazarus... I hope that I'm not breaching protocol but.. I am so very humbled to stand in your presence... I have studied your missions extensively... Though I am Thermian, I have lived my life by your philosophy, by the code of the Mak'tar.
I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
Could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one!
You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
Okay, now left at the next turn... Past the oxygen units.  Make a right there. Then go through the antimatter vent...
Commander, do you have a camera?  I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing.
What does the Omega 13 do?
Well, that's the big question, isn't it?
It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
BRANDON!	TIME TO GO!
I just can't believe it. Any of it!  Look at this room!.. They designed it based on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from "historical document" thirty seven.  Oh and wait, wait, listen to this!  Computer?
The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
No, I'll kill you. .
Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
The Omega 13... Why does that sound so familiar?...
Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?
I know...  You contruct a weapon.  Look around, can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?...
"Assault on Voltareck III."  Episode... 31 I think.
~e're alive!
How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
It's Jason...
Let me try.  Computer?  Computer?...
Wait. When are you going to tell them?
Tell them? About...
Hey... Hey where are you going?
All right... here's the plan:  First, Fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then Gwen, Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere.  Any of those things come back, give a signal. Guy, you set up a perimeter.
Gwen...
I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
Closer?  I can try.
Prepare a tear harness for the female...
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
Commander, I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance...
You... You mean Earth?
Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
To our brave guests.  Few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes.  We are blessed to count ourselves among them.
NO, Thank God he has not.
Commander...
Well... Sort of...
I'm not a Commander, there is no National Space Exploration Administration. There is no snip.
Excuse me?
All right guys... Uh... Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. Fred, you and Guy need to get that air valve back on.  Alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can't get the oxygen back in time.
Continue forward, sir?
WHAT? WH
Because they're coming right at us.
Some say that Hessians are invincible.
Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
I'm accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property.
We're in bad shape, Benedict, moral is low.  Before I can do anything, I need Lee and his seven thousand troops.  I've ordered him to join us three times.  In my last letter I all but begged him to come here. The man is insubordinate.
Then, I need you.  We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope at all.
Our plan is to hit them as they leave.
They're ready.  Believe me, the ones that stayed on here at Valley Forge are ready for anything.  Of course, we get nothing from Congress.  They need boots, coats... we desperately need food.
A lot of years have gone by.
Me?  You apologizing to me?
Yes, general.
Wil, I want to remind you of a conversation we started just before Monmouth...
No, my lord.
I am to take command of Major General Lafayette's division and lead the attack.
Who is that!?
General Washington, is there actually going to be a compromise, I mean, a 'deal' with England?
They're among the best divisions the British have.  No conscripts, no impressed recruits, just professional killers.
I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect!
George, remember that night when we were drinking with Arnold?
That's why the people trust you George.  Without someone at the convention, who has the people behind him, everything will fail. Will you do it?
The last I heard, a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on Breed's hill.  With one stroke the British could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it.
Who the hell knows?  Everyone's giving orders.  It's all very democratic.
I tell you every damned place I go the man is adored!  "General Washington!  Champion of Trenton! Savior of the Republic!"  And you should hear the way people are deprecating Congress!
Gag on your own invention, then.
Did God ever make such a pitiful army?
Congress is bitterly opposed to allowing Negroes in the army!
I mean, I'm a Deist.  A belief I share with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben Franklin.  Surely you knew that.
They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader...
Gentlemen, my I introduce a French gentleman, recently appointed major general by Congress...  Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. General Lafayette has brought us the greetings and goodwill of his countrymen, and... how many cases of muskets, Mon petite Marquis?
General Lee, sir!
My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.
But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
I'm very aware of that.
It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene.  Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?
I will not betray you, Nathanael.
But not more than your comfort.
Is it?  William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial?  I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you.
Now that is a lie!  See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet!  When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William!  Do you hear?  You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!
I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
I always though London was the place to be:  capital of the world, the most spectacular city on earth.
They can use their imaginations.
You are a slave owner!  You have been illegally surveying lands beyond the Ohio Valley!  That land belongs to the natives!
Is that your test of patriotism, George; if a man will die for you?
I reserved a Cadillac.
And I mean high up in it.  That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me, not Chili Palmer.
He knew it was a set up. He was ready for it.
So where's the money?
You guess? You mean you don't know?
Listen, tonight, later on, I got one for you doesn't involve any heavy work. I want you to go have a look around Chili Palmer's hotel room.
After this one, I'm out, Cat, you understand? This is the last time we talk to each other.
I don't know how I could've missed you with that shirt on. It's the same as the other one you had only the hibiscus are a different color. Right?
You think I'd be standing here? You set somebody up and you want it to work, it has to be a surprise. Can you remember that?
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
Look, there's no fuckin' way I'm gonna give you the key, outside of you point a gun at my head. Then we might have something to talk about. Now step away from the car.
I'm just explaining to you what I'm doing here. Case you think I come to rob the place, rip off any of this dusty old shit the man has.
It's what he said, I'm his associate.
Who?
The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
In just a second. Two...
I'm working on a few things.
Listen, Harry, how would you like to get your hands on five hundred grand? You pay me back at your convenience, no interest.
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
C-18.
What I been wondering is where's he been.
You get to town, you go straight to the bank, raid the limo account.
I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
Ray Barboni?
Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
I checked the bag at the airport, when I came.
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
I'm a producer.
It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
Anyway, you want this guy, he's in L.A. We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room.
You make movies, huh?
Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone.
So he comes to L.A...
The shylock's the good guy.
Really? You ever been arrested?
I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
Just a thought.
No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.
Hey, Harry.
Is he giving you a check or cash?
You have it?
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
Personally?
What Get Away jet?
Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?
Martin, look at me.
I turn it on when I confront the guy.
At that point, basically, that has to be it.
They report it to the IRS.
It's not one of these?
You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
Rough day on the set?
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
Right. See how your story ends.
This thing's actually accurate. I bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on Sunset...
That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.
Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.
It's not Dave. It's a movie.
You bet.
No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.
Passenger vessel "Chimera." I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at...  Two zero one four hours zulu time. Over.
Fucker!
Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
What?
Smokes?
I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma.
Dodge.  Dodge.
Yeah, from one side of the harbor to the other. But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over.
What is it?
Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
If he's reasonable, maybe we can make some kind of deal. If not. We'll have to re-consider our options.
That'd be my guess.
How do you mean?
Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
Don't lie to me!
That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.
That's what I call a payday.
Coffee.
Who?
Just before I heard him yell there was somebody on the radio.
Same. Any luck?
They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.
Hey.
Epps? You there?
We hit land.
So you killed them?
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
It's funny.
All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.
Some classy tub in it's day, huh?
If they thought it was lost at sea, they probably just wrote it off.
Fifty million four ways. That's twelve million and change a piece.  What you gonna do with your share, skipper?
What happened?
We ain't exactly in what you'd call your high traffic neighborhood either.
Shut up.
He took the shotgun and a light.
What's this?
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
Yeah, I heard about that.
Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
Seymour! Hello! What are you doing here?
Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...
Uh-oh.
Hmm.
Enid! I'm so sorry about what happened.
Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
Yeah, right...
Yeah, well --
What?... Oh suck my fucking dick!
What?
Good.
So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?
What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway?
Maybe there's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the Quality Cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us.
Look, that's back when I hated you.
I remember every minute of that party.
There's my dad with Joanie.
That Larry guy -- what look was he going for? A gay tennis player from the forties?
Is he wearing a green cardigan?
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
"Funky"?
Are you kidding? It's a dream job! I can't believe you got a job like that without even trying... God, I wish that was my job...
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine...
I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff.
Now are you going to get a regular job?
I'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move.  Aren't these the greatest towels?
Don't you want nice stuff?
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
What thing?
How repulsive!
Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you see it?  That must be it...
Hello?
That's all you're bringing?
Wow... finally.
Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
Shhh!
How much is this?
Do you have any other old records besides these?
Who does?
I thought it wasn't for sale.
Go die, asshole!
Norman.
You're late, asshole.
Hey, where are you going?
Five hundred.
Oh, come on! What are you talking about?
I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
So is that your boyfriend?
I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
It's not hopeless...
Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
Actually, I was a whole lot more interested in the Cook's phenomenon when I was about your age. I've kind of lost interest since I've been working for them...
For nineteen years...
I promise I'll take good care of it.
Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I really appreciate it...
Really?
So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something I have to show you...
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
I... I don't think so.
That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary. You better not --
At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!
What about Joe?
It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and I'd just disappear and they'd never see me again.
I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want?
I will if you want to.
No... forget it...
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
Yeah.
It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
What do we have here, Margaret?
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?
What are you talking about?
You were contracted to work-
Let me see the sick.
But I have in India- every country presents problems.
Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead.
Then why do you stay?
A man-eater attacks and you're such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it?
That's a terrible idea-
-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
We have hunted since childhood.
Finish your tour?
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
...one shot...
You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just-  -"there."
John, it will not be easy.
But you said they were always old.
-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now.  There's even less of him than of Singh.
What a good week.
It would have been a beautiful bridge, John. I never noticed before, occupied with other business, I	suppose...  ...never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but I've had the time today, nothing else on, and this... it's graceful and the placement couldn't be prettier... and... 
How many do you think they've killed?
Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
I do, actually; very much.
You like him, don't you?
Where is it?
Where do you go next?
Every day I ask you, and every day you've got something else to do.  Do I have bad breath or something?
Janosz?
No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
What are you working on, Egon?
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
Occasionally
Okay, that's no problem.
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
Can I help you?
What is it, honey?
What are you doing up here?
It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?
I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you.
Then why have you come?
The witness is leading him.  Sustained.
Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get in a lot of trouble.
I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.
I'm Egon --
It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
Great.  So what are you guys working on?
Who?
Who, Ray?
What happened?
Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we did for this city.
And he didn't die of old age either.  He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered.
You finished here?
I don't care what you say.  This could be a major Christmas gift item.
Ready?  What is it?
I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?
There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.
I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
Can't you tell me now?
I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
I am Zuul.  I am ...
Really!  Is it gone?
No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
Did you ever report it to anyone?
Because you didn't say the magic word.
Wait!  Wait!  Let me ask you something.  If you like shot Superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?
Were you recently in the bathroom?
The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
What have you got, Egon?
Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
What do you mean "bad?"
I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
You know, Peter, this could be a past life experience intruding on the present.
Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
I don't know.  Talk to it.
I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
You said you floored 'em at the Regents' meeting.
Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You don't know what it's like out there.
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.
Boy, that was a rough one.
Mmmhmmm.
Me, too.
You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.
What's he talking about?  Choose what?
Where are we now, Commodus?  Can you see the camp?  My Gods!  The air is turning into ice!
They hate me, they really hate me don't they?
Those are priceless sculptures.
What is that... wailing?
You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands.
Then you'd be out of a job.
Gods of hell!  This must cost a fortune!  How many days is this going to go on?
Throw it down into the streets! Down into the Forum.  If it's my father they want then give him to them!
I'm serious.
Marcus Aurelius has died.
I don't know...
My birth sign is Water Bearer, twenty-fifth day in the month of Janus.
The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty-first, you know.
God of passages and changes?
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
But have never been?
A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes.  At the core he's a man who believes in doing what's right.
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial.
He killed his father and then my family...
There's no reason to say that. Everyone knows you're going to be well.  I had Servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light.
Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?
Marcus, you honor me, but I'm a soldier, politics scare the hell out of me.
I was summoned.
He's very realistic.
The battle is over.  The war is over.  You've won!
How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...
Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans.  Teach them, who we are!
Who the hell are you?
I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.
General, hang on... drink slowly. You are blessed by the Gods to have a physician and a Divine of Janus with you tonight.  A fan sent them to you.
Proximo, if this is her doctor he's an assassin.
Tiger's challenged you and Jerses has made me an offer, made us both an offer:  you take a fall.
So I pretend I'm dead.  You get gold, what do I get?
As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
How much money is involved?
Then get a large cash advance.
Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?
Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know.
Yes.
Where are you meeting this person?
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
Is that him over there?
What?
Then what?
Yes.
You really will?
Why wouldn't it?
Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
Excuse me.  Mr. McQuire.
Ben.
Yes I am.
What's that?
You heard me. Out of here.
Mr. McCleery -- do you have some change? I need to use the phone?
Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
I'm putting it here by the door.
What? No. Nothing.
Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
What?
I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house.
But it's light in there now.
All right then.
Benjamin -- I'm sorry to be this way, but I don't want to be alone in this house.
What do you think of me?
Pardon?
Like what?
For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
I want to say something first.
Jesus Christ!
Do you want to?
Do you want me to get it?
Now?
That's fine.
Yes -- I think that would be good.
Well -- goodbye then --
Isn't there something you want to tell me?
Benjamin.
Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
Would this be easier for you in the dark?
Are you afraid of me?
Benjamin, is this your first time?
Wait a minute!
Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
Go ahead then.
No.
Yes I do.
What one.
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
But you don't hate him.
Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him.
What?
And you were a student also.
Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
What kind of car was it?
Do you understand that?
I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?
Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
Did I say that?
If that's how you feel --
Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.
May I stay then?
Now it seems to me --
What have you done to her?
I say I've got it.
Very good, sir.
Braddock -- Braddock?
What else?
Well you don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin.
Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
No -- they don't.
About what?
I guess -- about my future.
Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
Ben, can I say something to you?
Quite a while.
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
I'd like to hear it.
Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
No, I don't.
Dad -- could we just talk about this for a second?
What's happening?
I oughtn't to presume, but I --  I'm so grateful to you -- it's been so marvelous. The first time in my life I have gambled -- I've danced! Oh, you can laugh, gentlemen, but it's the first time in my life I've ever tasted life!
Have you a minute now?
I want to speak --
The pearls are in her room.
I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance.
You're a fool!
Who?
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That? 
You?
Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
Please do not be frightened, Madam.
I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya...
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
I want to be alone.
No.
Really?
No?
I'll not denounce you.
Shall I see you again?
Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.
If we could scare up some men to play.
Is that too much, Baron?
No -- not at all.
I take five hundred.
Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me.
So that's how we stand, Baron.
For me?
Man -- I was at the clinic the whole night -- there are no words to describe what my wife suffered.
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill.
Oh, but Doctor. Isn't this wonderful. To live -- to live -- in the Grand Hotel.
Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night. 
Barman -- whiskey --  For you, Mr. Kringelein?
A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing...
You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.
You like music?
Yes.
You dance splendidly.
Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It's you --
Money!
You...
You...
Skiing? 
Have you got it now?
My daughters -- yes, my daughters. 
Wait -- I must figure it up.  First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in England in March, I'll need a suit... You'd want me to look nice?
Can you pay some attention to me?
You're sweet.
I mean with the Manchester people?
I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
Now to proceed with the projected merger, the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious...
Yes --
Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester, -- Manchester -- Manchester.  You don't suppose for one moment that I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester. 
What?
Gentlemen, I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.
You're a deep one.
It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
Good morning, Suzette.
Oh, yes, Suzette.
Madam should sleep.
What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?... Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind?  ...Or is that the time?
The house is not full -- Is it really full?
Hurry, Suzette.
Gru -- you are positively radiant.
-- We must do something...
Yes, I know them --
Just one moment, sir.
What's the use of asking, Gru -- he is at the train -- He will be there.
Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
What's bluff?
Pretty as a picture.
One question. Do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth?
Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
You know it, Lilly.
Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.
Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
You ruined me! You destroyed me!
The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us, New York one hour behind. There isn't one hour of the day when both are open. Information moves, but it has to wait. Now, we have a young fellow working here -- Do you know what a hacker is, Mister Hebbing?
Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in.
Yes, yes, but that's --
You are a valued customer, as you know.
I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look a little pale. How soon will you be ready? A week?
I guess I owe you my life.
What are you talking about? So I've got a job. So what?
That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --
My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.
Sure.
If you come out to the track, don't know me.
I pay my debts.
Expecting visitors?
No.
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
I know what's bugging you, of course.
For God's sake, Lilly!
Roy... What if I told you I wasn't really your mother? That we weren't related?
That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all.
Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
You called the doctor, huh?
And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
Oh, don't be stupid.
Big spender.
You were right, I had to get out of that hospital. Nothing wrong with me any more.
You're on the grift. Same as me.
Nobody does that single-o.
I've heard the name.
He retired.
I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them.
Yeah?
You were gone for a while.
I saw her.
The last I looked, we were just talking things over.
What?
What is it? What's going on?
Yes?
I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell.
You take all your dates here. Blake?
Come on, Carter.  You know it's Michael.
Do you know who did this?
My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
Jimmy, what are you doing?
You sure?
Okay, you win.  I'll call you Mom. Now can I move into the dorms?
I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
Not me.
Why not?
Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?
What?
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
I have to pee.
Fuckin' A.
Better her than me.
Where's Shane?
But the dance is in the gymnasium.
Let the party begin.
Hold on, hot lips.  We got work to do.
Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
Mommy, I'm scared.
He told me about the terrible things that happened here.  In our house.
I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with.  John, I want you to come with us.
I've been knocking.  The door was open. Is everything all right in here?
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
Christ, what a night!  Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!
No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
Come now, Sam.  This is a gathering of old friends.  I know how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth.  After all, you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell you, but you've really given me no other choice.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
You've created a monster.
Who else knew I had the baby?!
Home is important to a man.
You know what gets me?
Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
At least we found the diamonds.
It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy.  You come home, and nobody's here.  When I go home, everybody's going to be there.
I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
That's the point!  Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up.
You're right!  We'll take a trip. A trip is what we'll take.  I don't want to talk about motorcycles.  I don't want to talk about tits.  Go home!
He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap.
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again."
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
Of course you'll go!  You're going to fly the helicopter.
What's this?
You never played a violin.
You did?
Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
You.
If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live."
They were enemies.  We were at war.
Our pleasure.
Blue soup.
I just want one true adventure before I die.
Fifty years?
It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
You're my buddy.
Hello.
You were about to ask a question?
And you've been roaming the streets while your mother is God-knows-where?
Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
Mhravitch.
Go on.
The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.
Will you go to bed?
Damn.
Mom?
No.
Then speak, by God!  Can you fight with words?
Daughter--I love you very much.
You are woman.  I know woman well.
My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there.
How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?
Like hugging a lamp post.
Situation.
Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
Harold!
Please--
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
I did?
Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
I should have torn that door off its hinges.  Should have scrogged her ears off.  Should have broken the bed.  What do you want?  Well?
I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.
And what is his most cherished possession?
I came for Paul as well.
I'm dying to hear of his reaction. The thrill of smashing something isn't in the smashing, but in the owner's reactions.
About a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat.
He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
No you don't.
Honor, I suppose.
It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
Ah!  The lady is armed.
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
And her fiancé!
You have chills?
It died for your sins.
Yes.
What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.
You haven't heard me yet.
Now who's being cruel?
You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
But the new hero will be a man of science and of peace--like me. He'll disarm you, of course.  No more guns, no more guns.
Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's time, it's time.
Leave the rifle here.
Dead!
I heard you were looking for me.
He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
He's a ghost!
A what kind of doctor?
I don't really know.
I hate that thing.
Where will you be?
Is Norbert still here?
No.
What?
There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
Everything stays as it is!
All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
Something happens to my confidence.
When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be my wife.
I'm sorry.
I didn't make my move fast enough. That's it, isn't it?  I was too respectful.
The animals made her sneeze and cry too much.
What?
That's the XKE.
I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there!
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
We've got to rescue him.
You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny.  Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow.
What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
No.
Apparently your friend has gone into Mexico. A Border Guard responded to the APB. How does it feel to have the L.A.P.D. doing your work for you?
We aren't gonna arrest him for that...
You want a tip?
I said I just wanted to talk to you...
Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
Yeah, yeah...
Yeah, overpowering. That was the word I was looking for.
Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
Overpowering?
I'm making a film. Jim Sullivan's going to be in it. He said you might know where Tod is.
Joanne?
You know her?
I thought you were going to bed?
I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
No.
How important do you think sex is?
Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
What does that mean?  What does he do?
More or less.
Grand Rapids? Of course.
Did you find out where she was?
But then you'll forget about me.
...What do you have to offer?
That's right.
As I was saying, I'll pick up the thread. There's a number of ways I can go. There's not much you can do here. Stay if you want. Maybe it'd be better if you went back home. Go through Kristen's personal stuff. Ask around, maybe she knew somebody out here.  Look, I do this a lot. I work at a minimum rate of $750.00 a week. It may seem like a lot of money to you, but it ain't. You could hire cheaper.
Yeah. Probably.
What are you doing here?
Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into.
Is Marsha there?
Wes, do me a favor.
I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone.
Hey, stop, stop. I'll do anything you want. It's okay. I can dig it. You can do anything you want to me.
No.
Take it or leave it.
What we got is just these here.  What you see.
It's a short film.
That's all right.
Not exactly...
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
I'm staking out this beer bottle. Trying to find out if I'll finish it or it'll finish me.
Huh?
Who's that?
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
Your tree.
Haven't we met before?
Officer, I can explain.
Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
What do you see?
Eh, no.
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
It's very interesting.
No.
Thank you, but it's an appointment. I really shouldn't miss it.
Sort of.
All right.
Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that.
The universal language of mankind.  What music do you like, Harold?
Why not?
Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
Okay?
I <u>think</u> I see it.
Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.
Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
With God?
Don't you advance on me.
That wasn't very scary.
Why are there no photographs in these frames?
Supper for two.
It's all right. It's organic.
But you're not going anywhere, are you?
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
Mother.
I'm getting married.
What?
At a funeral.
Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!
Oh, is this your father?
Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
Just give me a rough estimate.
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
Huh?
You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?
You liked your teachers?
Yes.
We are not relating today, Harold. I sense a definite resistance. A lack of true and helpful communication. I find you a very interesting case, Harold, but this reluctance of yours is detrimental to the psycho-analytical process, and can only hinder the possibility of effective treatment. Do you understand?
No.  I'd have liked to.
I'd have liked to talk to him.
What would you say?
I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
Yes, sir.
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
Yes.
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.
Julia.
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
She certainly has.
Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
The box. I need the box.
Kyle, you don't have...
No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.
I thought Steve had talked to you?
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.
Skip to the end, willya?  How do I kill it -- ?
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
C'mon -- Rasputin??
Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
And as a father, I worry about him.  In medieval stories, Agent Myers, there's often a young knight, inexperienced but pure of heart...
Well, you did break out --
His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in."
You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you.
I knew those men better than you did --
That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
-- should go back. Now!
No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are --
What are you, a Boy Scout?
No. I never was.
You want me to hold him down?
Professor, that girl you were talking about --
I think I can help -- Talk to her -- I can bring her back.
Nah, sounds too "needy."
Alone?
Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear.
What about you?
You fucking ass-holes.
Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says.
It's just a puzzle box.
Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
This isn't for real.
Suppose he HAD slipped us. What significance has that?
It's important.
Please listen to me --
Oh Christ.
Julia!
Kirsty. It's Frank. It's Uncle Frank.
Oh.  Oh yes.
Wedded bliss?
I'm very happy.
Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.
Who did?
Don't you care?
You're still blaming me.
So what's the argument?
Take it slowly.
I don't know where to begin...
What are you talking about?
Not much fun, is it?
Drinking alone.
Not much.
First time for everything.
You know, you're very beautiful.
I'll get the doctor.
Of course. Every day.
I guess.
She doesn't even want to leave the house.
Where are you going?
You know I do know the way home.
Why don't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room.
I beg your pardon?
Can I lend you a hand?
What?
'Bye.
I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
Yeah.
We can take your car.
What do you mean, "what?"
What are you snickering about?
No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?
...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to.
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
What do you think?  Dick likes it.
I have a television.
No.  The Righteous Brothers.
No, not nothing.  What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
Who are you going to see?
Pardon me?
Your desert island top-five.
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
Fine.  That's great.
Sure, but is that it for the list?
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving.  In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it.  Do all men go through this?
Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
Well, I'll just make it for you.
I understand, Dick.
Rob.
How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye?  It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.
-- Alright, alright but --
What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.
I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
Yeah.  Great.
I told you I slept with him.
You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? "Motel Matches?" "I Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass." "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana?  Maybe a Liz Phair track.  There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. Some devil's advocate stuff.  The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you...  But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there.  Ah.  Dylan. Bob fucking Dylan.  Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings.  He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing.
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
Are you still in love with me?
Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
Fix it up.  It'll make you feel better.
You know I'm a good person.
Mmm hmm.
Sure they are.
Pigsty.
Yes, of course.
You're soaking.
What do you mean?
When are you going back?
Laura...
But what?
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
You're tougher.
Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?
I called Dan Koretzky because he --
It's no joke.  I'm responsible for what happens, you know.  Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  I have to put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --
What are you going to talk to me about?
Enough, Liz.
Enough of what?
Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place?  Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?
For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
I'll call you.
How's the store?
She left.  She's gone.
What do you think?
It's the best collection I've ever seen.
Sixty.
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.
Wait a minute.  Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride.
He'd want to know about all this.
Well, the cream of society awaits.  If you're ever in the neighborhood...
It's my birthday.
Happy birthday.
Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
It's not mine.
It's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years.
Byzantine?
Good reflexes.
Where?
He was innocent.
No.
Maybe it would do us both good.
William Taupin seems to have left his mark.
It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives.
I'm not even sure why.
I didn't kill the watchman.
What about that family in '31?
What's wrong?
The inheritance.
Thanks.
What are you going to tell them?  That you're protecting a man who's killed four people?
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member.
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
What?
It is always less with my living. Far or near.  But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.  There is power in this.  And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all.
Go to hell.
It will take less effort as you learn.
I feel hardly nothing.
Some think not.
Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
You're wrong.
Finish yours?
Are you sure?
Old habits die hard.  Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic!  Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence.
I knew his great-grandfather.
You're insane.
Long time.
Tradition.
I was walking by when I heard a shout.  Your men came right after.
Do you know what this is?
My condolences.
Same.
Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind you I'm 74 now.
Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the hanging?
Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?
Seventy-five.
Au revoir, mon capitaine.
I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you.
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.
All right.  One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey.
I'm sure you haven't any.
Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars.
You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
Oh.
Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
Mother? But your mother --
I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
Just what is the lowdown on Williams?
But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
I don't know. This makes me feel funny.
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
The money? Why?
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing me in your dreams?
Now, that's a nice thing to say.
A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write:  'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it.
Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!
Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
Where'd you meet this man?
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition.
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.
No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?
Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can't desert now!
You know! You've got the brain of a pancake! That wasn't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution! Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley for the New York Herald! 
All the words you've got.
Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous?
Railroad tickets.
What happened?
Don't tell me -- was she killed?
I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
Which ought to be about three hours more, I'd say.
Don't tell me you were worried!
Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.
We've certainly been in some swell jams.
Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
Well -- what is it?
Where'd you wire him?
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
Sure.
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
It'll be Heaven!
What?
And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
How much?
Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie Malloy, in whose room you were. You will be Earl Williams. And I will be the policeman. Follow me, Mr. Williams?
Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got calls to make, you know.
A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it.
That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  Gimme the desk.
So have we!
Oh, I'm sorry, Gus! My foot must have slipped.
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
Where is he?
Read it! Insane, he says.  He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!
Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?
I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night.
I mean I'm scratching your name off the ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in your place. It's nothing personal. And, Pete -- it's the only way out. It's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make.
Fred!
Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!
I did.  Hold the wire.
No -- don't out me off.
Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
Fine, thanks, Sheriff.
I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued.
We run smack into a police patrol. You know what I mean? We broke it in half!
Certified, eh? Who is it -- your milkman?
All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
Here!
Kings and sixes.
Hildy, I thought you were gone --
You didn't mean to kill that policeman?
It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
Very simple, Earl.
Isn't that her picture?
They're not human!
What's that?
What's from the Governor?
Get the Governor on the phone!
Why not?
For heaven's sake, why not?
Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
Is it hard?
Get the cops, somebody.
What's your hurry?
I know.
Give him the you-know-what.
Only till they get you into the local school.
What are you doing here? This is our territory
Bloody.
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Go and ask her if she wants to play.
I did see them. I did.
Mind that shrapnel DAWN thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in BILL'S face.
You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
Except the servicemen.
Don't panic!  Keep your head!
And absent bridegrooms!
Has Sue got it right?
We don't know anything about it
Well, it's off ration. We know that.
Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me.
The ideas you get in your head.
You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
No, Mother! It's War! War!
...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. All the punts lit up with Chinese lanterns. Like fireflies. And the gramophone going on one of the boats. Always the Charleston, the Charleston, the Charleston. Oh, you girls.
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
You might still have a house.
What can you do with four daughters, I asked myself, A string quartet was all I could come up with. They hated me for making them learn.
I don't know how you cope, Grace. Three kids, army pay. On your own.
Yeah, I know where that is, it's right by my house. It's Dr. Satan's tree. I can show ya.
Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
Any cone, yeah...  I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either.
He left!
Thank you.
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
Keep the change and get yourself a new name.
Shit, I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.
Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
I don't drive cross country.
But suppose for a second you did.
Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
Hold on, I've heard this before... but I can't remember the end.
So, the guy goes to Hell and the devil says, "do you smoke?" The guy say, "yeah"... the devil say, "great cause Tuesday is cigar night, sweetest Cuban cigars you ever had."
Shit, we really need to find some gas.
How awesome?
It's a hitchhiker.
OK, let's relax. I'll check it, maybe I'm wrong. Don't everybody freak out just yet.
Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
Almost there.
Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland.
Fine. I'll go straight.
I gotta open the gate.
Yeah, they weren't here but a few minutes, didn't really have time to get as up close and personal as I do with most of the assholes that wander through here.
Fascinating.
What?
Yeah, doesn't hurt himself, just spins it around next to his eyeball.
Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
Huh?
This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.
I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.
Thank you.
We've got get out of here, we got get out of here.
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
What? I didn't hear anything.
A couple hours!
Holy Jesus, somebody had themselves a field day beating the shit outta this thing.
Not yet.
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
God damn.
Open up the trunk.
Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
Oh, right.
I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm.
Fit the profile?
Your Spidey senses tingling.
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
I always favored the Hulk.
Wydell.
It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
You remind me so much of Nathan.
You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.
Well, I don't know. I'm actually on my way to...
Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very important man and...
Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.
You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice. Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this.
Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
I love you so much, Gabrielle.
The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too.
Urgh.
Please. Just one minute of your time.
I've moved on.
I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong.
Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt.
My brother says things are going really well between you and Nathan.
No. I married a midget.
I have a friend you might like to meet.
Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.
I'm not sure.
Yeah  But I have some peculiarities also.
I was simply attempting to keep the evening light. You know that I feel similarly to you about nature.
Oh, and the sun block?
What SPF, sweetie?
I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that.  Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?
Did you see that?
He looks perfectly fine.
Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject.
Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.
You have to shave? Like an ape?
Was that okay? I mean, was I able to... satisfy you?
Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late.
Shh. It's okay.  It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.
No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
Look at you two. You both disgust me.
Interesting.
Mother?
Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though.
Yep.
Pittsburgh?
Oh, wait a minute, Miss Packard.
I want to talk to you.
That's the way it's done.
Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?
Okay?
What is?
Pool.
You being cute?
That's your problem.
Maybe by that time you'll die of old age. How much do you think you'll, uh, need?
How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
Eddie, you're a born loser.
First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off.
Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
Thanks for the drink.
You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.
Hey, wait.  What are you gonna do about the money?
There are places. I'll scuffle around.
Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and they'll eat you alive.
Sign up.
No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
You must have a lot of confidence in me.
I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
It's a long walk.
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
Okay, I'm Eddie Felson. I shoot straight pool. You got any straight pool shooters in this here poolroom?
Yeah, that's right.
You ought to take up crap shooting. Talk about luck!
Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?
I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before.
Whaddya mean?
How much we got?
Is this all we got left?
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
You walked out on me like that. No goodbye, no nothing. Like a thief in the dark. We were partners. We were more than partners.  He was like a... like --
Yeah, yeah, like a son.  I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, "This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy."
HOW MUCH?!
Yeah, to play Fats again.
No, no more for me.
That's right. When?
Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
Yeah. You must come again.
You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
It's the lights. And the scotch.
No, I didn't mean that -- whatever that means. I mean, you just don't look young enough.
You got it all in your head?
Oh, cut my finger.
Who is it?
Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser.
Would he know?
What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
You need the words?
More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.
Well, what's the matter?
Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?
Hundred dollars?
Boy, he is great! Jeez, that old fat man. Look at the way he moves. Like a dancer.
That's what the game's all about.
Very good shot.
Game's over, Eddie.
It is not arguing to speak the truth.
What?
Have you always had it?
You and that damned garden.
Is the hill ours too?
That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.
He was upset with moving, I believe.
About what?
Mr. Gardner, I --
You people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. I'm of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle ... What sort of training do you have anyway?
How did it get Mrs. McKeltch?
I'd believe him.
I don't see anything.
It's really nice of you to help us.
What do you want me to do?
Just my luck, no ice.
We're losing them.
No. The good news is I found the problem and it's not our equipment. There's some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed.
Yes, because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it. When I find the exact binary sequence and I apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer I built you last Christmas, we should be able to block out the overlay completely...
Can you believe this?
Spunky?
You try Martin?
Perfect, she's using it.
I'm making a mess.
What the hell are you doing?
Grey, you read me?
Where's it headed?
You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency! You knew all about this. When were you planning on informing the rest of us!?
It had been deemed classified.
A meteor?
Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
Wait. I have to tell you something.
You know me...
So, what do you do for a living?
Stop it.
He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right?
They let you out?
What can you tell us about the enemy we're facing?
Can they be killed?
Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?
It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?
But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.
Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
Dad was onto something here!
Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.
Look what you did!
I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
Where did this come from?
"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."
What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
DONOVAN!
Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
I'm through!
Yes?
I usually don't either.
It must be one of these...
I never expected to see you again.
Dad!
Out!
Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
...you did it.
Rats?
They want my diary.
How did you she was a Nazi?
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
Dad!
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
But what are they? Can't you remember?
What about Marcus?
Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
I didn't know you could fly a plane.
I know, Dad!
Dad?
Ready?
Uh-huh.
I don't need camels.
Then we'll die.
Who are you?
And why were you trying to kill me?
Charming.
The Prime Minister doesn't seem that naive.
Miss Scott panicked?
Jones isn't in his room. Miss Scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi --
I sense the fumes of opium in all this. Perhaps Miss Scott picked up the habit in Shanghai.
Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
Step on it, Short Round!
You got the tickets, Short Round?
Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up and keep eye on things...
Let up on the brake!
That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
What evil?
Was the stone very smooth?  It was probably brought here from a sacred river.
What're we going to do?! Where're we going?!
What do you mean -- how?
Don't let it pull you deeper!
What?!
I've always had a weakness for folk dancing.
No -- don't you see -- crawling --
Get -- the -- bug -- off!
What?!
There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!
Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!
I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.
I said something.
My name is AL.
Try me.
Don't do that.
Yeah...Who?
It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?
Yep.
You're gonna explain.
I don't know...To get Al.
They could put you back in the tube..
You're the one talking to a little guy in your head.  ...We'll have to do it on our own.
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
Sue them.
I don't like the sound of that.
Go out, take your first left.
Black suits and helmets.
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
I don't have any.
Why not?
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
Oh yeah, to what?
Why not?
.
Where is she staying?
Now, where would I be?
Much too blue.
It is my business. It's my name.
You got a better idea, you tell me. Other than her, there's no one here I know.
Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses.
Is that all?
No. What will you do.
Osaka.
Osaka?
Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
Door to the right. Get up and run.
I don't trust her.
He hung us up dry.
This may hurt.
Be quiet.
I have been... I think you're right.
JOE What abilities...?
JOE It's not love. It's like. It's real strong like. And I got your information. Now, get off my back!
Doesn't matter.
I've seen that before. Never had anyone actually do it.
We've ruined his market in Japan.. Where's Dieter?
What kind of a deal?
They have stolen state property.
Who's our little man?
They took the tapes.
Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.
...Foreign service.
And...you know Jan Gruner?
When you do...
Oh.
Why would we want to hurt you?
Not you. Them.
Ahhh...nothing.
Was quite excited, when he came in...
Sue who?
What?
I said...I didn't say..anything!
Is someone else here?
Let you leave without it.
Why?
It's not apparent.
Can I help?
I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
How often they come here?
Why did you stay with me?
You seemed interesting.
There's not much to tell.
Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
No, he didn't do that.
One chip?
What's Gruner like?
And you?
What?
He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
Why did you, then?
You son of a bitch! You conned me!
Do something!
It was me. He just told me how...I wish he could tell me now.
It is?
I can't get it out. It would take hours.
The other working.
It'l be alright.
Hi, honey.
I heard them.
Where?
Three hours.
We gotta hook up.
These are their leads, their sources. I want you to have your reporters...
Get me Wigand.
Do you want more rice?
Maybe later.
I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
Okay. 
How grave?
Hello?
Don't you have to be at the office?
I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...?
Thomas Sandefur...
...taping?  What are you taping?
Who's calling?
Did you say Berman?
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
Get some perspective, Lowell.
...you fucked me!
Is it too late?
Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?
Has he decided to go public? Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know... Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him. So, is your man truly committed?
Yeah, I'm here.
Yeah.
Hardly new news.
We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained.  What if he were "compelled"?
Oh, man.
How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?
Oh, please, Mike...
No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
Please to explain, why I should agree to interview... with pro-Zionist American media?
Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and I see the questions first. Then I decide if I grant the interview.
I know what I have to know.
Should I just take the documents now?
Why am I gonna mention your name?
Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?
I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job? Having status? And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism? Something to do on a Sunday night. And maybe it won't change a fucking thing. And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke, alone!
I heard.
ABC Telemarketing Company.
What does this have to do with my testimony?
Well, no, look... I mean, there was a footprint. Forget it. It's probably not important at all.  You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry.  So, what were you calling about?
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
You heard Mr. Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive...?
All of us did. There was this whole line of people... whole line of CEOs up there all swearing.
The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...
Poor communication skills.
And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate.
You threatening my family, now, too?
"Research..."  You declare, as a badge of honor, you don't even know what makes water boil...
Few suicide attempts, little inpatient stint. Naturally, she misses her kids. Six weekends a year and alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh to us but -- hey -- all's fair. Anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse," takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop.
A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room!
Grounds?
Do you think I'm going to end up like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy bag instead of a family?
My God.
You should have tried to get pregnant Marylin -- solidify your position.
Well. He said to "make the house mine."
Why would you be here?
Not really. You're not my client. Freedom of association. Big issue with the First Amendment fans. Want to go to Hawaii for the weekend?
Have you ever been married, Miles?
No.
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
Getting married.
I'd like to offer my congratulations. That was a beautiful gesture of Howard's.
Miles. Miles. Miles.
You have a very nice home, Miles. Very inviting.
She didn't love you?
We're damaged goods.
I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.
Did you just propose to me?
You do?
Fabric and fringe.
Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
Hello?
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
Murder!
Pre-Castro.
Is this a lover?
Maybe.
Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination.
I can't do this anymore. Let's get some lunch.
What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
So, Miles. If you have a proposal, let's hear it.
...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
I can't help it. Even with the business we're in, I -- it gets me every time. It's so -- optimistic.
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
She owes me a meal.
I'd stay away from her, Miles.
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
Can't you get them to go any faster?  This dissolves to a deserted ROAD, Peter at the wheel of his car. His high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing.
Mr. Warne?
What ten thousand?
The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to—
You were taken for a buggy ride?
Do you love her?
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do it—if I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmm—mmm. This filet mignon is divine!
He's one of the best fliers in the country. Right now he's planning a trip to Japan.
You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'm—I'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questions—I—  Isn't all this what you wanted?  You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?
I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious.  Where'd you meet him?
But that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, why—
I'm sorry you read it.
Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants.  She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money.
You talk as if—
Ellie? Oh, she's no responsibility.
Personally, I think it's stupid!  But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object.
We've done that already.
What happened?
Any others?
Never mind, son. She doesn't want it. 
What happened to your money?
Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?  "My tonsils won't burn— As life's corners I . . .
Hey, whadda you tryin' to do—kid me?
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.
Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
What am I going to do now?
Don't tell me you did it on my account!  hope you're not getting any idea that what happened last night is—  You needn't concern yourself about me, young man. I can take care of myself.
My ticket?
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. 
I didn't ask for your advice. 
Beat it! 
Darn clever, these Armenians.
Your ego is colossal.
Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
I can't go out like this.
It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. I—I did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?
Santa Claus?
That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?
Yeah. I got a letter from Aunt Betty. She says if we don't stop over at Wilkes-Barre she'll never forgive us.
Don't get excited, Peter. They just asked a civil question.
Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat lately.  Ouch!
Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
Yeah.
My uncle—Mother's brother—had four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back."
All right. You win. Let's forget it.
I wasn't gone more than a minute. Just went out to find you something to eat.
But the thumb always works. Different ways to do it, though. Depends on how you feel. For instance, number one is a short, jerky movement—  That shows independence. You don't care if they stop or not. 'Cause you got some money in your pocket, see?
You figured that all out yourself, huh?
Come on—get in.
Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket! 
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
Hey, wait a minute!  Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me.
Maybe I could jump out of the window.  Do you think they'd see me?
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we?
Whatever you say, darling.
Can I use your telephone? I want to talk to New York.
You made no mistake sitting next to me.  Just between us, the kinda muggs you meet on a hop like this ain't nothing to write home to the wife about. You gotta be awful careful who you hit up with, is what I always say, and you can't be too particular, neither. Once when I was comin' through North Carolina, I got to gabbin' with a good-lookin' mama. One of those young ones, you know, and plenty classy, too. Kinda struck my fancy. You know how it is. Well, sir, you could'a knocked me over with a Mack truck. I was just warming up when she's yanked offa the bus. Who do you think she was? Huh? Might as well give up. The girl bandit! The one the papers been writin' about.  Yessir, you coulda knocked me over with a Mack truck.  What's the matter, sister? You ain't sayin' much.
What's up?
Yeah? Where?
Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
That she's going to marry somebody else.
You're drunk.
I am, Joe.
'Bye, Agnes. You're beautiful. All women are beautiful!  Gordon is immediately electrified into action.
When you sober up—come in and see me.
ain't got a hat—
I ain't got a hat.
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
What's on your mind?
Do you pack a gat?[11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly.
No.
Gee! That musta been terrible.  I guess he had it coming to him though. But don't you worry about me. I don't talk. I never talk. Take my word for it. Gee, I wouldn't want anything to happen to my kids.
If this is Oswald, it must be our third Oswald.
When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.
What was his voice like?
Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.
I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.
Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to look in your files?  I saw enough here this summer to write a book.
Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
Yeah.  They were seen together in Clinton in early September.  The Civil Rights Movement was running a voter registration drive.
At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
He had his palm print on the weapon.
I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but...
Found another note, same thing, no name, no signature.  "When you receive this, I will be quite dead, so no answer will be possible.  I offered you love.  All I got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth."
I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.
Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick - he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes.
No, I would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures I've been shown.
Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name.
Yeah.  Come on, Dave, come on our side.  I guarantee you the boss'll protect you...  Dave?
...give me protection?
I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?
They'll get to you, too - they'll destroy you... They're untouchable, man...  I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see straight.
As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
Daddy said it was all right if I was real quiet.
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
Don't get sidetracked!  How does he get back to the States?  That's the point.  Does he have any problems?
The Oswalds are introduced by George de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill Williams.  It's through Janet Williams in October '63 that Lee gets the warehouse job, right smack on Elm Street at the Book Depository, which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence.
All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.
After dinner you paid him to have sex with you.
Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?
Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
I can't believe a man as intelligent as Earl Warren ever read what's in those volumes.
I cannot believe this.  It's four- thirty, Jim Garrison.  I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ...
Hi.
Did they live?
Did you enter Virginia into a beauty contest?
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
Get a hold of yourself.
That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me - all this time you never believed me.
Huh?
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
Lou, you were in the Marines.  Who would be running that training?
Graveyard dead.  August this year.  A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died. 
Goddamn Sam!
Beats me.  City officials.  Secret Service.  Dallas police.  They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before.  But they didn't bother running through Dealey.  They stopped right there, said something like, "and afterwards there's only the freeway," and went home.
You know who the mayor was?
Maybe we should just call it a day, Lou.  Go home.  While we're still a little behind.  We got two people killed, maybe more we never thought about.
Are they?  Why would they?
I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat, I don't...
The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
Ever ask him?
You never ask a spook a question. No point.  He'll never give you a straight answer.  General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.
You have other information?
Never.  Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go.  I said enough.  I said all I'm going to say. 
Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.
Even my own wife, chief,  Who's wondering where I am?
Hello.  Is this Jim Garrison's daughter?
And you get of from school at 3 every day?
No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby. There are a good many things involved in that.
Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
I know. That's why I went.
I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
What?
That requires me goin' out tonight?
You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.
Course you didn't.
Does he have the marked bills on him?
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
What's going on?
My pocketbook.
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
Same as you. Ten thousand.
I didn't?
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
What, I couldn't hear you?
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
Fifteen thousand.
Well, hello.
"American President"
How was it?
I go back to work tomorrow.
You talk them into it?
Why?
Do you think they bought it?
It'll be more than that.
You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
Madrid or Barcelona?
I'm just tired in general.
Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up.
What if I plead guilty?
Look, that shit ain't mine.
Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?
He sells guns.
You ever see him sell guns?
I'm recording this.
What did you say?
Uh-huh.
You didn't count it?
Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now.
I thought I did.
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
There was a guy with Melanie?
We had our agent on you. She sees a blonde come out of the fitting room carrying a Robinson's/May bag and tussle with a tough-looking white guy. The white guy takes the shopping bag and they go.
You'd take a polygraph on it?
I thought you were watching him.
Beaumont Livingston?
It looks good on you.
I said, you understand what I'm saying
Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
It's true, isn't it?
If you just listen, you'll see it's a damn good idea. The first time I do it they're lurking about. They see me hand the ten thousand to someone.
If you want.
Yeah, I think a woman.
I was there, I saw her do it.
Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills.
Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.
It's boring, isn't it?
Four days ago.
How long?
Uh-huh.
What for?
Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.
Yeah.
I thought you were sixteen.
So where did you go?
That's a picture of me in Japan.
Who's arm is that?
That sounds like a problem.
Uh-huh?
That's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go over and look at this Michi Moon display.
I'm getting out of here. What do you think?
As low as two.
Whatcha watchin'?
I'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
You're outside?
She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
Uh-huh.
You shot Melanie?
In the chest and stomach.
What?
If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off.
Tell me.
Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county.
How am I supposed to know that?
You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
Comfortable?
What?
Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out.
Where is it?
Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at.
Have her bring the money here.
By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he?
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
No.
We're back.
Home?  This is your home. You're dead.
Dream on!
Della?
What do you want from me?
I could have told you that.
Listen, I just got a strange call from Geary. He said the guys backed down. What's he talking about?
Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that?
It was the window.
Doctor.  Ph.D.
You need ... a doctor.
War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
A bit.
Turn on your right side.  How about the other "right?"  I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
Ah, good. Now turn to your left.
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
You should go back to her.
I don't know. I've been having them recently.  You know, you look like an angel, Louis, an overgrown cherub. Anyone ever tell you that?
Louis, you're a life saver.
Well, I'll see what I can do about it.
I've seen it. It's all pain.
What? By myself?
Jake, you need to rest.
Are you in the service?
I haven't seen her in months.
Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft.  I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
It's freezing.
Why didn't you turn on the light?
I didn't want to wake you.
Your kid dropped it off.
They're weird names.
I don't let anybody call me that.
You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
Why you left.
Not to me.
I'm going home.
Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake. The money. Things like that. Or your wife.
They're like demons, Jez.
They weren't human!
Show me Della!
How high is that?
Coming here?
That's your decision.
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?
Look, I'm horny. Keep it in mind.  Love me a little?
I want to know. You tell me!
Who was that?
I have no idea.  I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
Who are you? What are you doing to me?
It's going to be all right, Jake. It's going to be all right. Don't be afraid. I've got you now.
I don't know you.
What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
You look terrible. What happened?  Jake ... is it the antidote?
I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage.  Where'd you go today?
Oh?  Where you going?
Where are they?
This isn't happening.
I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me?
No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
Never?
"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  Stick out your tongue.  That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax.
What? You want the Plaza? Don't be foolish. Here. Take this, too.  This is my place on Prince Street. It's got my phone, everything. Call if you need me ... but you won't. Everything's gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York police can be effective when they want to be.
How was Palm Springs?
Lennox Hospital.
That's a lie. My family was here.
Hello.
I don't know.
That's as straight as I can put it. And don't tell me that I'm crazy 'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to Hell. They're comin' after me.
Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
Bomb?
I'll need system four converters.
Hey! I'm not ready.
Then what do we do?!
Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
Jesus what the hell is that?
I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.
Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
Where are you going?
Okay, good tip.
Did you like it?
Well?
God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!
We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey.
Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.
Oh, shit. He's going to see us.
Push off toward us.
Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!
You think it killed . . .  Yeah, I guess not.
Hurry! She's lost it!
Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie...
Do I have to?
But...I...400 years?
More soldiers?
This is Matt Hooper...
It's my charter. My party.
What's the point with hooks and Lines? --
How come the sun didn't used to shine in here?
Right.
Did you burn another kettle? Y'know you're a fire hazard? This is the third one!
You want to go through those?  I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop. It's Marcia Vaughn's pet charity. Pick out what you want to keep -- it's mostly your city clothes.
You're very tight, y'know?  Right there.
It's three feet deep, Martin
Home... New York?
I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't you make Hendricks Chief? His family's been here since the Puritans -- half this island are his cousins.
Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.
Maybe we can save August...
...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. Torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. May I have a drink of water? Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. Portions of denuded bone remaining.  -- did you notify the coast guard?
No, it was local jurisdiction.
Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.  Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?
Dynamite!  How was your day...?
Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?
About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
...And it was Dartmouth Winter weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, and I was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family, and she was right -- her great-grandfather was in mining, and my ancestors were Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up and I went home with some beatnik from Sarah Lawrence.
Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
Quint...?
What day is this?
Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad in Field and Stream.
Look, I've got to talk to her. This isn't a contest we want the whole country entering.
You do this all the time, right, Charlie?
Twenty years.
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
He's busy.
I've been to sea since I was 12. I've crewed three Trans-pacs --
Easy! It'll tear right out!
Hey Bleek.
Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.
Go Carole.  So, guess what?
I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.
I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe.
We're getting a stretch limo.
Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint.
Hey man.
Did you hear it's yours?
Wait, what's that supposed to mean?
I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
Oh, God...
No.
I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.
You don't know anything about me!
Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag.
So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.
Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here.
Am I supposed to feel happy now?
Tell me about it. I used to play in a really tight band back when I lived in Chicago, and one night we opened for the Melvins... do you know who the Melvins are?
Yeah.
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
Oh.
I wrote that.
I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.
You don't have to do that.
Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?
Hey, what kind of swag did you score?
I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
Cold feet.
Oh really? What's the verdict?
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
Uh, hi Su-Chin.
Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
I heard that was you.
Can I take your coats?
What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
Do you need a large sum of money? Legal counsel?
They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.
Excuse me?
Think you can narrow it down for me.
Tore up from the floor up?
I sort of already have.
Well, you know where the lavatory is.  You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine!
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
Maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for spring break.
Well, maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads. I see them all the time in the Penny Saver.
What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
Aw, please Junebug?
How do you know I'm so poisonous? Like, what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters?
I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously.
God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?
You don't say.
A Pilates machine?
Juno, what's the matter?
I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
She answered our prayers.
Like what? Be a rock star?
I called Gerta Rauss. She says she can represent both of us. They call it "collaborative divorce." It's apparently all the rage right now. And it's easy because we don't have children.
Have you found a place to stay?
Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
...Yeah.
Hold still.
Adele... are you serious?
What?
What'll we do out there?
You know... I read once... Ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind.
Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.
Early, what're you doin'?
Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
You gonna talk to the people who did those murders?
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
I always thought it was the work of a serial killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And again. Until someone stopped him.
Sure.
Yeah?
Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game.
...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.
If you say so.
The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.
Just being there where it really happened. It was different... more visceral.
Thanks. What are you doing?
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
I still think we should have met them first.
Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock?
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
What is it?
Bri'.
What about the owner of the house...  ...this John Diebold, any idea where he might be?
Umm. Altogether?
Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.
Yes!
What?
And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby.
78th.
Did she suck your dick?
I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.
I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.
Man, this guy is really good.
Who?
It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember?
At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law.
So.
Nah.
Hey. What are you doin' right now?
You know I've been thinking about you lately.
Do you like kissing me?
Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel?
Who are they?
Yeah.
Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.
One.
You're OK?
Miss, would I be prying?
Thanks.
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
Hello Paul. Is Telly inside?
You still mad at him?
Mine?
Yeah. And sex is just like, yeah let's have sex.
You know what it's like. It's like when you really love someone, it's like awww.
I've known the past of all the people I've fucked without a condom. Like I know one of the people got tested and was negative.
You've heard the stories right?
Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.
It's me. Telly.
To come?
Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.
I can't man.
Shit. All right. But don't fuck with anything OK?
Casual?  You were boning her weren't you?
He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven.  Why not come back then and listen for yourself.
What do you mean, no?
We didn't ask for your opinion, Doctor.
That's right.  I guess only the killer would know that.
You still having a problem with this?
How is she?
You alright?
Did anyone stand out?
What do you mean, stand out?
Remember eventually revenge is carefully...  Have you tired juxtaposing the words?
We'll find the evidence.
Why did you write remember on the wall?
Where is she?
Why are you doing this?  You must have some idea of the pain you're causing people.
You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
The police haven't told you?
That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley?  "His play is always fair and just."
I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
Computers.  That's how you got into Homesearchers records.  You can get into anything.  But why?  Why?
What scars?
You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
Why did he what?
That's only because you don't know where to go.  You like hiking?  Fishing?  Sailing?  What do you like?
Okay.  Nice meeting you.
What is it, dad?
Whaddaya got, Nolan?
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
Same as the others?
We're not sure.
Well, I think you have to play to his ego.  He thinks he's superior.  The more secure he feels, the more chances he'll take.
This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.
If you can think of anything else give us a call.
Ten days ago.
I know you're busy so I'll get right to it.  Did you know her?
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
As large as castles.  You are still light as air, one hundred men can't move me.
Don't you understand what I'm telling you?  That's why he wants me out of the way.
You're always in the middle of a match.
What do you see here?
If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?
That's a very personal question.
It is.
Do you always open quickly?
I can't right now.  I've got a game.
I think it's interesting.
This isn't a game.
Take your average cop.  They deal with death everyday.  If they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement.
That's true -- but the emotion is still there.  They just learn to control it.
I'm just curious.
That's not fair!
I know it was bad.
Why?
Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
It was.
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.
I'm hungry.
Would you settle for pepperoni?
In a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... Why does he set this line apart?
I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
I can't think any more, unless it's about you.  I'll be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move, I think about how you look when you smile.  Remember how you said that I hide behind my chessboard?  Ever since my wife died I've been...  I've been afraid of getting too close to someone again -- afraid of losing them.
Then help me to understand.  I want to understand.
Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
It could be anything.
You beat him.
I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.
I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.
Have they harmed you?
I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.
I know it.
Will your power outward.
Does the Queen live?
It is the Fortress of Krull. I know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. They did not use it on our world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. This time they mean to conquer, at all costs.
You have not slept in two days.
They know when they're going to die?
She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is.
Yes.
Lyssa? <u>Why</u>?
The Beast will kill her.
She can see the Beast!
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
You too are lonely.
I ache with it.
Help! Help! I'm drowning!
What business?
I have need of friends.
We must try to get horses.
The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.
Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.
What are you doing with my dear? Stop! Thieves!
I am being exploited! Where are you going?
Oh, my poor stew!
The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
He is the King.
I do not want your worlds or your slaves.
A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
It is the time.
We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great powers of vision.
The Widow of the Web?
Kegan!
I was beautiful then.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
Where is he? My son.
You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.
You will come with me.
...Office 2702.
At a certain moment I thought: maybe Leon would like working on his own? So he makes some little extras?
Tell me... The money I earn and you keep for me...
Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
Here, this is the light scoop for night shooting. There, you fix client's distance... How much to the bench down there in the park?
Huh... 500 meters?
Who'll I aim at?
Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.
Why?
...I'm going to kiss you.
...Shit!!  We'd found him. We waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window.
What shall we do?
Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.
Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too. You have to grow up.
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
...Yes?
How are you, Miss?
You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always.  It's the only important thing in the world.
Why am I such an authority?
Maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.
What if you don't make it?
Nothing's going to happen.
How long does this... Mania last?
Look, I'll see if anyone has spotted him recently.  If I get any information, I'll call you.
Are you a preacher?
So what's the deal Maurice?
I mean why the sudden voluntary visit  -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
You do?
You have?
Anything?
You like to take walks?
Ellen, there are two kinds of people in the world --
Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie.  It must have been difficult.
You don't have to prove anything to her.
Red flag, man.
Red flags man.
A marriage certificate?  Who the hell carries their marriage certificate around?
Shit!  He jumped!
You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.
Three thousand miles?... How many times does twenty go into three thousand?
Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.
Ellen got up every morning and went to the corner store to get me my bread for breakfast... Everyday. Now that's about a quarter mile each way... 17 years... that comes to about three thousand miles...  And you know what Kris?
Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it'll help.  But I'm not risking your life.
There are a lot of people worried about you.
Hello, Mr. Parker.
He wants to reward you... That's why I'm here.
Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
No alcohol. You gotta get something else. Everything's ten dollars. What do you want?
Sparkling apple cider?
No.
I sometimes fade out.
No, I came here to drink... myself... you know...
What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
How long have I been here?
I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
Me neither.
Sera you are crazy.
Sera, I love that name... S.E.R.A. Before we proceed onwards, there is something I need to say. OK?
No?
How are you doing?
That's impressive. How did you do that?
You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed.
Yes... I'll give you that.
There are limits.
How much, do you think?
I don't want this. Yuri, please. I really don't want this. You know I don't like to do groups.
A full night on the street and this is all?
Don't hit me.
He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
I'm not having an affair with Enrique -- you know a Delta Gamma would never sleep with a man who wears a thong! I just liked watching him bend over to clean the filter --
What's going on?
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
And if you in fact, heard the gunshot, then Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs. Which would mean that you would've had to have found Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible. Isn't that right?
So everything you just said --
I think so...
I didn't even get to go to his birthday party.
So, what's this Sarah got that you don't? Three tits?
God, that felt great!
Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?
I'm here to see Brooke Windham.
The idiot speaks.
I believe her, too. I don't think she's having an affair with Enrique.
Yes, you are.
I don't know! Everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more --  Serious!
Here. You're gonna need this.
Oh, how sweet! You made friends with a nerdy girl.
Do they just -- put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time?
And make sure you read the footnotes in Levinson's class. That's where all her exam questions come from.
I can't believe you called me a butthead. No one's called me a butt- head since ninth grade.
The what?
Hey --
Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
So now you're -- ?
Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty- hose. No more trying to be something I'm not.
Up for a celebration dinner?
Oh, he is so over on this campus.
Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
You guys -- I can't. We're in the middle of a trial.
Neither.
Why not?
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
Then what? My boobs are too big?
Harvard. Law school.
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
Thanks for the backup.
Where?
A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.
Aside from the fact that he found her on an infomercial? She said they humped like gorillas. Chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house.
I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney.  Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.
Hovering?
Elle?
Oh, God. What if Josh doesn't think I'm serious enough?
What?
You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.
Your soul...?  Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?
From the parapets most likely.  The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving.
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
Then you'll understand my quest.  An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
It's terrible.
Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance.
And how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk?  Is me music not to your liking?  Mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure.
No... I... I need to rest.
You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad.
I meant no disrespect.
I fear she's lost.
Why, Jack-lad, she likes you, is all.  And what hot-blooded hero wouldn't welcome the affections of a fair nymph like Oona here...?  If your blood runs so cold, boy, you be a corpse before your time.
Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.
True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.
How is it this hag knows the truth?
And if she thinks me a liar?
You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
The colt's still too small.
You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.
How do you plan on finding this here castle, if ye don't mind me asking?
Better to kill than be disturbed.
Nice piece of work.
Shhh!  Not so loud, mayhap he'll hear ye.
We'll find it.
Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
Why not mine the damned walls?
The wound is mortal.
Easily... The question is, can we save ourselves?  Be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war.
I don't... understand.
I'm not afraid of the dark.
Did you bring me here to sup?
I've not heard a note out of you.
I'll do anything... face any challenge!
I was with the Princess.
She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it.  Said she'd marry me if I did.
And did you?
Aye... my Lord...
Liar!
There's no happier thought under heaven.
Tis not fit for a princess.
Seemed like weeks and weeks.  Such a terrible dream... I could never tell you...
Lili... I love you!
I can't see a thing.
Honored to make your acquaintance.
We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
What's this now?
Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...
Not very precise directions.
Princess Lili, Godwin's daughter. She was with me when calamity struck, but after I could find no trace of her.
I don't believe you.
As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom.
I'd be honored.
Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
And am I not fair?
Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.
What care I for the human heart! Such a soft, spiritless thing it is. I prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves; fierce and free and keen as steel!
Up ahead!
What care the bones when the soul is free?
Uhm... fine work.
Lost?
Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest...
Simple as that, eh?
Let that be our problem, just get us there.
And we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then George taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color I liked best!  And he said he loved me!
What's that for?
I couldn't get it to go down.
He seems lonely.
Don't you have school?
I want you to try something with me, okay?
Hey.
Really?
I've seen lots of people.  It's not a big thing for me.
What's the point of this?
You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
Hey, I can get you three hundred cash for two hours.
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
He's at work while I'm here.
I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
This is such a street of whiners.
We've known each other since grade school.
That would take weeks.
How's your wife?
Maybe...?
Is Alyssa home?
She didn't really say.
Hello?
I'll ask.
I know what the deal is.  Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.
To check up on me?
Because I live there.
Your nose ring comes out of your nose. If you've got them in your nipples, they come out, too.  And there's no make-up at my house.  No glue sniffing.  Huffing. No pills, no grass.
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
Probably in the bible.
Why?
I don't know.
I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.
If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.
The gloves on the table are for you.
I know.  Why?
What are you now?
See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.
Getting high, I guess.
To hide a black eye.
Why wouldn't she leave?
I mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what?  Because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain.  And you're going through them quick.
And you told Mom today?
This was all for your sake, wasn't it? Having me here?  Trying to get me to like you.
I'm surprised he hasn't left.
She's a little sad, is all.
Did Sam call to tell you he wouldn't be over this weekend?
You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
Four days.  I left to think.
But you can't call me while you think?
I was parked in day parking.
You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it.
Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
Hey, hey!
I drove over and you were gone.
I can't leave the house?
I did say he could go.
It makes me sad.
What?
I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza?
It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.
Finished or unfinished?
Let's see if you've gotten any better.
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that?
I'll say a lot of things I've never said before.  It's habit.
What did he say?
Are you going to kiss me?
Nothing.
What the fuck?
Then you tell me, what just happened?
The biggest waste of time since television.
I'm helping George build his house.
You can't go with me because of Sam?
That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?
You never really trusted me.
I guess I could teach you some things.
I didn't go in your room.
Can you stay for dinner?
The door was open.
You're sure about this?
Yeah.
You could keep it and rent it out?
A night in the hole?
He's a big one.
You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
My name's Yvette. Sylvia sent me. You look just like she said.
I know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me to take care of you.
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
Goodnight, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Pike.
Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line.  What's wrong, baby?
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
That's because I've never been here before.
Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a girl a drink?  Two bourbons.
Don't I know you?
Here, this belongs to you.  It was empty when I found it.
I don't see where that's any of your business.
What are they gonna do to us?
You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.
There is no Boom-Boom Room.
Maybe we oughta find another place.
Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle Claude.
So?
Maynard Banks, Esquire. Attorney at law.
What's up, Ray?
What do you want, Claude?
What do I want? What makes you think I want something?
Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him --
What'd you say?
Say what?
What you're dealing with here is a complete lack of talent.
I'm not in the mood right now, Ray.
They're called pilots! I'm serious, Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked-up plans right now.
Crop duster.
That's the way it is.
You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy. You two planning on going steady, or something?
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
You ain't getting out of that trunk.
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
What'd you say?
Are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here?
Soft and supple. Like a lady's.
Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.
That musta messed 'em up pretty bad.
It's alright for a man to cry once in awhile. Just don't make a habit of it.
Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
Hunting's been pretty good on the farm the last few years. It's one of the perks of the job. If you're interested, tomorrow I could show you some of my favorite spots.
Besides, why bother with bootlegging when we got us a clear cut case of murder?
Goddamn it, Wilkins, would you please just shoot the nigger!
Appreciate it.
Goldmouth? They say he was born out back behind the shithouse. That's what they say.
What's the Boom Boom Room?
Alright Willie, I think I got everything. I'll talk to Dillard, see if I can get up to the infirmary and check up on you. Make sure they're changing your diapers regular.
Blacks welcome there?
Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
What's that, some of your bathtub brew?
If you fuck me on this one, I'll spare no expense.
ADRIAN!
Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?
Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
All right. Let me out.
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
My mom wasn't a goat?
They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
I didn't murder anybody
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
This is baloney!
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
Definitely.
I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
No. This can't be happening.
Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?
You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
By she, do you mean he?
Which way did he go?
What's Ozzy trying to say there?
So I followed him...
I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
Really?
I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
We're going to Jersey?
A black guy?
No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
How do you think we got here??!!
You know about Sanctuary! I know you do! You have to help us! You don't have a choice! It isn't your decision!! Tell us.
How do you want us?
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
I am.
Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape.
You missed something special.
That was a great shot you made.
No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
What's wrong, Available?
No.  Just no.
Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
Killed? Why do you use that word?
Later.
But you put yourself on the circuit!
I thought I had to do something.
Curious.
Of course.
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
About running, dying what?
Where did you get that?
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
Are you here to help me?
I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan?
You think Sandmen will?  There's no other way for me,
Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.  Now to the right. It's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me.
Will you take me with you?
...But I still have the choice...?
I have never seen a face like that before. It must be the look of great age. Whoever he was he was terribly old.
Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?
You want there to be one... that doesn't...
No, there doesn't. Not really -- just so many want it to exist... so many who don't want to die... want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes "real". But it doesn't exist. It never existed. Just the hope.
No.
Are there any other humans?
Gracious... no.
But there may be a few around somewhere.
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
Yes...
Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone.
It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
They're comin' with us.
Pete... You okay?
As best we can.
You don't remember being awakened? It looks like you were aware of someone.
Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
I was here yesterday.
Yeah, I remember.
I want more.
Okay...
You like it?
Pornos.
Yes.
Andy, who is that guy?
Dick Laurent?
Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you, Pete. How are you?
Hey.
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
Sheila?
The wife killer?
Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay.
I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
You just gonna let him go?
No, sir, it's not.
No... I don't feel so good. I would like some aspirin.
What's the matter?
No, no I don't. Are you sure?
I like to laugh, Fred.
A videotape.
I called, you know.
Called? When?
What the hell is going on?!
What was that?!!!
I thought you were getting me a drink?
It was a long time ago... I met him at this place called Moke's... We... became friends... He told me about a job...
The heart, I guess.
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! 
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
Eight, nine car lengths. A hundred and sixty-two feet.
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
How ya doin', Pete?
At your house. Don't you remember?
You want some company?
What night?
You still care about me?
What else about that night?... Did anything happen?
You really don't remember?
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
Sorry.
Yes, it just shows—  I don't know why I'm talking to you. I don't know you. Who are you?
I didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.
Why, of course. Yes.
Look here—
I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
Oh, really?
That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
No kidding?
colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people—
Yeah. You know.
So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
You see? You get the idea? From this reservoir here I can pipe in the whole works. Oh, I'm going to get a great kick out of this. Of course it's just to keep my hand in, but with the equipment we have here, I can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there. Can rig it up in no time.  Do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water?
Huh?
Nothing. Why?
If you want me to!
There you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving.
Leaving?
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
Oh, good heavens, no!
You have no disputes over women?
That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
You're startled?
I surprise you? Now that's news.
Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing! And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh, I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.
Yes.
Why, no.
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
That Conway seemed to belong here. In fact, it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here.
Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report out yet?
Don't worry, George. Nothing's going to happen. I'll fall right into line. I'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be. I'll be the best little Foreign Secretary we ever had, just because I haven't the nerve to be anything else.
Oh, stop it!
Oh George, come on.
What is it?
That's what you said.
George, come back!
For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose of—
I don't know what you're talking about. You're carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up. If you'll only tell me about it.
What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
You're wrong, George.
What was that?
I guess we're in for it.
Imagine having all that fuel there, waiting for us!  George, something tells me our journey is just beginning.
Oh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it?
I saw a man whose life was empty.
Yes.
Thank you.
All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world, with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me entirely.
Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.
Bump?
Why?
Struggling, why?
Would you like to wring my little neck?
I'd love it!
I've thought about it for years.  I knew you'd come. And I knew if you did - you'd never leave.  Am I forgiven for sending for you?
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
All right, I'll be there.
Hell of an assistant, isn't he?  Damn guy moves so fast, he actually gets there before you even ask for him.
Mikey.  Hold it, Mikey-- I want you to talk to me.  Mikey.  I'm telling you.. don't make me... Mikey   Gimme the 140.
Helluva night, isn't it?
Vayanse. You others, go on.
She didn't even know you. .
Ha ha.  No, really.
Why?
Kay, um... how, uh, fast does this thing actually go ... ?
Something's wrong here.
I dunno. Why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner?.
Jesus...
Where's it coming?  Where's he landing?
I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.
Or what's no horrible down here that everyone's trying to avoid It?
I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across.
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way.
I swear to God, that was not here two days ago...
What do we do?    Lean into it.
No.
Try seven.  From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident.  You wanna tell me what's going on?  Huh?
Actually, yeah--
Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
Did it leave?
Actually, I don't know...
And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
I'm sorry, but I need your help. You contain information.  I need to know how to get it.  Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is?  Can you tell me if --
He'll turn around.
The other two will die without me.
That's comforting.
Yeah --
How do I find the --
I'm setting up a timer.  When it goes off tomorrow, take off your bandages and get the hell out of here.  But not before then, or you'll --
Victim's a white female.
That's an old one.  One of our first.
Looks like she was a neuroin addict like John Doe here, but I show an address history that includes the Beaton Clinic.
Don't worry, Lamar.
And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
Justice already knows.  Talk to me, John.  Tell me what's happening?
John.  Please.  Listen to me --
John --
People want to believe in the system.  That's the beauty of it...
Chief, the investigator from the Fed is here.
Uh, sir...
Red Ball?
I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
Really?  You've never been inside?
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
It seems I've found a flaw, John  You.
Are you reading my mind right now?
Rufus, play it back...
The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad.
I wanted to.
I'm your son.  I'm you.
I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
You're not gonna kill me...
Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
Insignificant to you maybe, but what about those people I put away with alternate futures?  My God, if the country knew there was a chance they might not --
What safe place is that?
How do I even know which one has it?
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
John?
Sean --
The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
He told me about this.  You got this from Containment?
We could have lunch together.
Cream and sugar.
No.
You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
Is it a good room?
What, sir?
Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is.
We're in Fashion.
He's great, right. Is he great?
And how could you fucking leave Horrace hanging?
A elephant seal. Where's mommy?
She's, uh, sleeping.
Mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes. Don't you like your pretty clothes?
You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti
Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy?
Can you take me to Color Me Mine?
You talk to Max today?
You shouldn't. He likes you.
Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
Your dance is over.
It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been?
Yeah.
Where we going?
Where's Ricky?
A million. Easy.
She was fast, huh?
You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.
Ruiz knows about this?
Yes.
There won't be a next thing.
'Dis?' 'Dis?' You're not in a position to 'dis', or 'give props', or whatever your Real World sense of fucking decorum tells you to do. You're nothing. You're wallpaper. You're not here to make fucking friends. Asking a motherfucker where he lives. And who the fuck told you 'Red Dragon'?.
So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
You don't know where you're going?
No. Just the cross streets.
Don't be shitty.
What happened to boxing? I thought we made a vow.
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
I'll get the girl.
We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
Maybe we should call for a cab.
Forty-six.
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
What exactly did they say?
What the fuck do you have to complain about?
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
What the fuck is that supposed --
I don't know.
Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
What's up?
C'mon, man...
The penguin house.
Yeah. Let's look at the penguins.
All the more reason.
You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
What about it?
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan.
Dude, we were practically made...
I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in?
Tom. How's it going?
Kinda. Yeah.
You want your surprise?
Ugh...
Yes.  Would you care for another one?
I'm half Irish.
Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.
No shit?
Sure. Anyplace in particular?
Coke?
Here they are, then.
How's it going?
Come, now. You just got here.
The Soho Grand?
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
We're going to New York?
We're square.
Yeah. That fernet tastes like tar. My grandfather tried to give me that.
Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.
Well, word on the street is you're Welsh.
Dip?
Red, and I ain't no punk.
Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.
YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
Ain't nuthin' in the world to give you that real deep cool. Like girl. You there?
It's me or you, ain't it, Pops?
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats.
What's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
What? Everybody knows God is White.
Little.
I'm not Malcolm Little and I'm not Satan.
The body is a holy repository.
You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
Folks are sitting out there today, not next week, expecting to hear our program.
Could we sit down someplace?
I can handle it.
You have enough worries of your own.
We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.
What do you want me to do? Our people need me.
We need you too!
Shhh!
Dear heart, where are you?
I don't care about myself, my wife and four children were sleeping in their beds, they have nothing to do with this.
Brother Earl.
I wish you'd listen to us. What about the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people.
I assumed...
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.
But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
You put it very well.
No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
Can I ask you something?
What?
I say a lot of things.
Two years in the Women's Reformatory at Framingham.
Baby, I'll call you tomorrow.
I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
Your control over your children, therefore --
You like 'em scrambled soft or hard, sweetie?
Well, all right, then.
I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart sometimes.
Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby?
I ain't doing bad.
What did you do, Homey, palm it?
Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.
I'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one.
Watch your tongue, boy.
Are you sure?
Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen. Maybe then we'll get somewhere.
It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works.
Maybe I can help your situation and you mine.
How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
I show, you give me the information?
[What's the PIN number?]
[Who's the boss?]
[The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]
[Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?]
[Do you know who I am?]
[I don't know. We were just given instructions to take her.]
[I'm professional. I just do my job.]
[He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.]
[Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?]
[I want you.]
[Do you know who I am? I am the commandante of the Judicial anti- kidnapping division.]
[Please, don't...]
[Yes. Many times.]
Were you provided with a gun?
Yes.
And what if amateurs try it?
But don't you stay in El Paso?
You mean a misfire?
Creasy?
Pinta...
We're taking a different way home.
No.
Pinta, do you have a pencil?
Where?
The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you?
Do you always sleep with him?
Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
Still not a question.
There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
The world of our children. How dare they?
I don't believe you.
You're lying. I don't believe you.
For an American she understands this country very well.
[OK, repeat the drop instructions.]
When?
I like him, Mom.
I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick.
Bye, Mom.
I think it's nice he's American.
It will be a hard break.
[Is that good or bad?]
You and Creasy both. A two man army according to Interpol. Panama. Lebanon with the Druze. Desert Storm. Where you were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt down elite Iraqi military commanders.  You two were a married couple.
Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead.
Which one was that?
Oh, yeah.
Not a bad crowd tonight, you know?
Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them? I'll take the one inna green dress.
I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
What for?
It must be one o'clock.
It's Saturday night! There's still plenty-a action around!
All right, I'll see you!
Marty, your mother wants you onna phone.
I feel fine.
We gotta postcard from my son Nickie and his bride. They're inna big hotel in Florida on their honeymoon. Everything is very nice.
Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
What happen?
This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
What they say?
Who?
Were the lights on?
Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.
I like you. I like you. I been telling you all night, I like you...
Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
I'm just here with another girl.
...so the whole book winds up, Mike Hammer, he's inna room there with this doll. So he says, "You rat, you are the murderer." So she begins to con him, you know? She tells him how she loves him. And then Bam! He shoots her in the stomach. So she's laying there, gasping for breath, and she says, "How could you do that?" And he says, "It was easy."
What time is it?
Tommy, before you go, I wonder if you gimme a little advice.
What?
Ha! Who told you about the Stardust Ballroom?
Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
Oh, it's a sad business.  My sister, Catherine, she don't get along with her daughter-in-law, so she's gonna come live with us.
Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?
I heard you, Ma.
What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.
So these two girls come over to the bar...
...I been talking about two nurses Leo and me picked up in a bar on Seventy-First Street.
So, Marty, let me tell you about these nurses...
The nurses Leo and me picked up last night. We got a date with them tonight.
I'm with a girl, Ralph.
No, that's my sister Margaret's husband, Frank. My sister Margaret, she's married to the insurance salesman, and my sister Rose, she married a contractor. They moved to Detroit last year. And my other sister Frances, she got married about two and a half years ago in Saint John's Church on Kingsbridge Avenue. Oh, that was a big affair. Well, let's see now, that'll be about a dollar- seventy-nine. How's that with you?
All right, Ginnie, don't get so excited.
Hello, Thomas.
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
Home.
Pulse, slow, very little pressure.
I don't know what else. You've been that route a little, haven't you?
Okay, I'm a witness, but how do you prove who's right?
You mind if we get out of this guy's brain first?
My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
You got directions?
Crabapple Cove. Maine.
Little light reading matter. Just right for his age.
He can't take much more time on the table.
This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
When?
Hell, man, that don't matter. We're loaded. We were big wheels in the black market in Seoul.
There's no point appealing to Colonel Blake. They've got him bewitched.
Godless buffoons, all of them.
You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
The hell we won't! You bastards pulled something, I don't know what, but we've been beating you without him. Ane we'll go on beating you!
I think I've seen this nut somewhere.  Haven't I?
What are they peeking at? Captain Waldowski in the shower?
No, no, that one.
I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them.
That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.
What's the matter?
In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
You're on his side all of the sudden?
Captain Camembert! Captain Camembert!
Excuse me, Sergeant.
Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
Thanks.
The real Trapper John? The one who threw you the famous pass and went to greater glory on the Boston and Maine Railroad?
What's wrong with him?
Just in dreams?
But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
It's a nice idea. I mean it has style.
You mean who hit who?
If you say so, Henry. But remember my claustrophobia.
One of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight?
O'Reilly, what is it?  There aren't more choppers coming?
Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.
Oh, get out of here!
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
Yeah. No, no!  No! No, look. You don't have to smell the world! 
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
I don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I don't like the idea of being stopped either.
Me?
Can I help you pack?
Well, would you like to know who it was you were marrying?
How much money do you get?
Thirty dollars.
Oh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. Well—I don't quite know what to say . . .
Oh, I'm sorry, Ma. Oh, don't pay any attention to me. I guess I'm just upset about all this. Gee whiz, here I am with a great opportunity to get somewhere, to give us security for once in our lives, and I'm stuck. If I could put this over, your Mrs. Burke can have six babies!
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
What's that?
Well, the whole town's curious about John Doe and, boom, just like that you're going to bury him. There's enough circulation in that man to start a shortage in the ink market!
A deal?
Okay, sister, you get your job back.
So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?
Well, maybe you're right.
Yes.  What's he doing here?
I got it all ready. Here.
And you! Start pounding that typewriter. Oh, boy! This is terrific!  No responsibilities on our part. Just statements from John Doe and we can blast our heads off.
If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.
Colonel!
Have you seen him?
What do you do when you work?
Baseball?
Hey, Boss.
The heelots!
Well, sir, about a dozen families got together and gave Grubbel a job watering their lawns. Isn't that wonderful? And then we found jobs for six other people and they've all gone off relief!
You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the John Doe Clubs.
Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty.
Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started—
Oh!
Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It was easy as all that, huh?
I know one way you can do it.
Have you got the speech I gave you?
Shh!
What?
Out the window! Something just flew by!
I don't know.
He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
Used record shop down on Turk Street. I was in there looking for some Robert Johnson.  Memories... Memory Lane or something...
Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
Am I gettin' the car?
What?!
Manual or automatic?
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
It's all there.
I'm impressed. I didn't think you could do it. What did you have to do, steal them?
That's not going to look too good on your service record.
Come on. Let's go for a drink.
You got a girlfriend?
That's a lot of commitment. I admire that.
I think I can handle that one.
I can't do that.
You know the ten commandments?
You know why I like the track?
I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks.
Still needs work.
To run last?
He's got the girl.
Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
How many have you lost?
That's a chance I gotta take.
I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
Have you evacuated anyone?
Is the hostage injured?
You know what I think? I think you only want me now, because I'm with somebody else.
Let me take you out tomorrow night... Pleeease.
I wanted to get this out of the way.
Yeah that's it.
Yeah?
Scottie...
Yeah.
Prude.
Stay up there, Girl...
Depends. What's up?
And a car.
Yeah, they are but...
Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
Because I took it out of your memory.
Your life that bad?
Do you believe in miracles?
Yes.
The new world.
It's not real.
Dream?!
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
But what if he doesn't --
How long 'till we can eject?
Take care.
He had keys.
We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
Corporate fingerprints all over it.
You've got the keys, send someone in --
What is it?
Christoph was in charge of designing building modules.
I've got to get back.
Most nights you wake up crying. Never knowing why.
We worked together on the inside. You were on my programming team --
I'm sorry.
Destination?
Connection approved.  Ready to transmit --
Access granted.  Male or female?
Program name?
Select uplink for Federal Communications Office.  Department of Enforcement.
WE CAN'T BREAK FREE!
So how can we get to it?
Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart and bold.
The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
That's the only way to the Monolith...
... Not bad.
FOUR SECONDS TO IMPACT!
Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.
The earth was hurtling toward us at seven hundred miles per hour, and we knew at that moment that we were facing death straight in the eye.
BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!!
Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you.
Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do.
The commission don't decide how I spend my honeymoon.
Boo-Boo.
Maybe you better hear what I got to say first.
Precisely. We are the true entrepreneurs, and Prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. America is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of Little Italy.
How's Bugsy doin'?
A hundred-seven bucks too much. Any kid who drops an extra dime is gonna be talkin' to Moliari.
Well...
Luciano.
You got something to hide?
You could have stopped him.
If I look weak now, it's over.
Meyer.
Married? To Anna?  You ain't got her in trouble?
After all this time I'd think you'd know me better, Meyer.
It's not myself I'm worried about.
We got exactly two choices, Maranzano or Masseria.
Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.
Tell me, Charlie. Please.
We gotta talk in private. I got a friend in Coney Island who's gonna open his restaurant just for us.
If you give him the chance, Lansky will betray you like Judas.
Even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns.
Those fucks can't leave each other alone. Maranzano and Masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war.
Masseria's scared. He might make our deal.
Everybody's talkin' about ya, Charlie. First time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.
That a Jew compliment?
Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over.
Uhh - martini?
Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
At the moment, yes.
Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!
Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
You know, Julie, even if this works - which it probably won't - that stuff is tricky. You don't know what it'll do to his brain.
It's a special kind of party. A <u>farewell</u> party. Do you...get what I'm saying?
NO! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?? HE'S GOT MY E-TICKET! HE'S GOT MY -
Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new guest settling in - ?
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
Monkeybone...!?
Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?
Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
I don't think so.
Stu?
The ring...
I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you.
Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
Go. Just <u>go</u>.
I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. ­- DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
All right. You can come.
He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> Stop shaking! I'll protect you.
IT'S NOT WORKING.
Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.
My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.
I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications.
He seemed quite taken with you.
You know, you never tell me anything.
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
You know, you ought to come out to South Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve. He's single.
Where to?
Moscow.
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?
Look out for those fellows--they tell the truth about you--sometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senator's friends. The front row--the empty one--is for the President and White House guests-- see that old couple over there-- they've attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo--
It was done to stop me from talking about a section of the Appropriations Bill!
You've never *seen* this contract.
You are saying, in effect, that this is a forgery?
Huh?
I would cherish you--and stay sober.
You got worms.
Kid--wait--what do you think you're going to do?
That gorilla in Man's clothing-- McGann.
The Silver Knight. Soul of Honor--on a tight-rope.
You play--left field.
Forget it, kid. What's it *to* you?
"There's more light here," he says--
My friends?
Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?
No. How'd you feel? Quick.
Diz--
Have *you*?
Don't say "okay," Diz. Say you think it's beautiful.
Okay--I mean--
I won't take it! See? I won't be party to murder. See? Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that grafting Taylor mob is low enough. But helping that dame cut him up in little pieces besides--nobody's gonna make me do that. No, sir.
Come on--don't pull that. You know you'd give your right--. What are you staying away from him for?
Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every paper. They're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires!
Emma! I'm a man at the end of his rope.
How do you feel, champ?
Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.
He's batty!
They put up *their* candidate? Who?
Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
Aw--
The--head?
What were you saying, Governor? Sorry.
Gee, I wouldn't appoint an old twerp like Horace Miller--Taylor or no Taylor!
Will the Senator yield?
Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
I'm sorry! Gee! I hope--
Will he yield for a question?
Please, sir!--come with me!
Certainly would, Joseph.
Just fine.
Is--is something the matter?
Gee, I'm sorry. You see, it wasn't until I was fairly well along in the bus that I realized--
Did you say--bus?
There *what* was?
No, gee--I couldn't stay here--
We're going right ahead with--*what*?
Right.
What's that?
Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
Have I?
Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
Terrible, thank you.
All right. Sure. Just curious. The picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle-- or something--
It *is* not!
Abigail.
No! Stop it!
I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time--  I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?
Not another bill?
Don't mention it--
What are you going to do?
I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!
Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
How are the pigeons?
Splendid.
Well--I--
Since the time of Adams--not Washington.
I wouldn't wait if I were you.
What do you mean? What's going on?
H'ya, Carl--h'ya, Bill!
Chick--
--I've used every argument in the world to try to turn him off. He just keeps coming back to the dam-- and what he knows--
You want to see me, Senator?
Nice *compliment*!
What do you want, Senator?
All right--*yes*! And what does that make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!
*Me! Me*! I *still* don't see why I should--! If you love him so much, why don't you go to him yourself and-- ? Or better still--get up in that Senate and *fight* for him!
Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.
Jim, you can't come here and pull that steamroller stuff. Your methods won't do here. This boy is a Senator, however it happened, he's a Senator. This is Washington.
I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
Jim, it's just that I like the kid-- I don't want to see you get too rough on him.
Anything *better* to offer?
Here, here, Susan--this is Jeff Smith-- our new Senator.
How nice.
Deeds?
For no reason, I guess. He always does it. We always run into the house when we see him coming.
All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify.  Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
No.
I haven't.
You are under oath, Miss Bennett. I ask you again - are you employed by the Morning Mail?
Look, this is my house. I'd like to—
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
It's awfully nice of you to show me around like this.
Sure. I met you.
Huh?  Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.
I say, to most people it's a washout.
There's Times Square.
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
What did he play?
The drums. He taught me to play some.
Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would you like to hear me?
The reason why I wanted to take a walk, Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to you.
No, I don't mind.
A girl?
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
Yeah, then what?
Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.
Huh?
Uh-huh.
He'll probably kick me right down the stairs. I only hope he does.
I tell you that dame's nuts.
It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.
Boy, was he burning.
Gold, eh?
Is that the best you've got?
Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it.
The Falkner sisters are rather timid, Your Honor, and wish to be together. If the court pleases, I will only have one of them testify.
Well, your uncle was Chairman of the Board of Directors. They probably expect you to carry on.
Perhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000!
No?
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds.
Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?
No, thanks.
No, I'm his housekeeper.
Name your poison and I'll supply it.
He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to—
That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
What about it, Mr. Deeds?
Well, I don't know. I—
Yes. Have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating?
Huh? On, no. Nobody important.
Say fellow, you neglected me - and I feel very put out.  Look, sock it right there, will you? Lay one right on the button,[6] but sock it hard.
New mouthpiece. Been waiting two weeks for this. Kids keep swiping them all the time. They use 'em for bean shooters.  What can I do for you gentlemen?
Well, we could borrow a couple from Mrs. Simpson. You know, she went to Niagara Falls last year.
What - tails?  Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me?  I never wore one of those things in my life.
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
You're Walter, aren't you?
Please!
You try it.
Pack my things, Walter. I'm going home.
I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.
Doubtful. What did he say?
I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.
Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
We got divorced.  I had to get rid of her. She couldn't satisfy me.
You remember when I asked you about pornography --
Do you want to come in?
No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
Are you a man who likes to treat himself right?
I've had my moments.
Althea hasn't told you?
Clarence Norman White, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged?
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
We're going for a walk.
Well, look who's here...
Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
Just who is here, can you tell me?
You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?
Please... forgive me.
I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.
I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.
My brother said you were about to fire me.
You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to.  Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you.
I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
...How violated I feel?
But...
But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off.
Will you be here?
What do you mean, "in no time"?
Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?
You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?
What do you want me to see?
If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
Was it something that happened at school?
Would you like another beer?
I understand.
Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with.
Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?
Don't you like this?
Well, there's Lily.
Pretty good, too. Lots of detail. Nothing hard core. Old-fashioned ones, from back when people cared about atmosphere and character.
I want to tell you something, Doc, but before I do, I need to ask you a question... Because, for me to tell you this thing -- well, I haven't told anybody about this. It's the biggest secret I've got.
Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can.  And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us?  Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.
Just you.
I've told you a lot of private stuff.
-- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service?
But look at me now...
And the drugs?
Somebody's taking a shower down there.
What about it?
Skip, I've got a problem and I need some advice.
I'm here for you, Doc.
You know where he's taking her?
Who the hell are these guys?
They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
We saved him! Saved him before the creature could finish his work. Now leave, all of you, quickly, before he finishes you all.
By reading the Book Of The Dead.
Oh yes, of course.
Now go find me a big stick.
You put up with me, because I can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library.
You will not believe it.
So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold --
The hell with that! I'm not goin' nowhere! We're safe here.
Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.
Could you tell me how to get there? The exact location?
Give... give him... give him GLAAAA-- !
Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell."
Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself
No... Why?... Should I?
Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
You sure you outta be playin, around with that?
You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
Got guts, lady.
I found it, Evy! I found it
We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them.
Where's my gun?
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
Except for one little thing.
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
It must have slipped my mind.
Where are you going?
You two timing psychotic bastard.
Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a guy thing.
That's two more than the Fantastic Four.
Hey... you okay?
Thanks.
Roy.
What are you talking about?
I'm liking this.
You sure that's how you spell it?
There's a big difference.
Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
I saw him go in -- and he didn't come out!
But there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.
What's that?
You guys going to a costume party?
We're superheroes.
What are you doing in the silver drawer?
Do we have to?
Through there!
It is a thing entirely unknown in diplomacy, that one government should assume a right to dictate to another, who is upon terms of equality, the conditions on which she should conduct her commerce; and, assuming such a right, second it by threatening language, in case of non-compliance.
My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to.
I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England.
Very well, General, what is it you wish to say?
I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
If he withdraws his army in good order, it will be a serious political defeat.  But, if he should be caught on the move, with his army, in the full grip of winter, then it will be a catastrophe.  If Your Majesty can prolong his hopes for a treaty by silence, be deceit, by any means, for another month, thus postponing his departure, then the graves of his army are already dug in the soil of Russia.
General Kutusov, I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them.  I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration.
And, what a delightful idea!
Yes, Captain?  Have you anything you wish to say?
I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.
I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?
I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.
Just a minute, General.  Listen, don't let them fool you with all their grand la-de-da.  They've all made their money from the war -- mostly from crooked war contracts. They say Citizen Barras has put away millions.
How did it spread so quickly?
It is the work of incendiaries.
Our troops have no part in this.  It has been started by the Russians!
Then what brings you out on such a night?
Are you staying with a friend, sir?
Uh-hh... yes, of course -- if you would like to go... there... but... I have very little money.
Only Lisette?
Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.
Are you sure that you are not still in love with her?
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
I am delighted to be of service to you again, Your Highness.  And I can tell you, my instructions came directly from the Emperor, with a caution to be discreet.
I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.
Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house.
May I offer you a drink?
I thought I was.  I was confused.
No.
Were any of them prettier than I am?
What are you doing in there?
Yes.
I didn't mean the things that I said... I was angry and I said more than I meant to.
Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend?
What are you talking about?
What?
Do you know what you're saying?
You mean you heard them making love?
I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
Do you like music?
I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.
Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria.  A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard.
I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
Good day to our brothers-in-arms. Have you come to join us?
Come in.
Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.
Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica on August 15th, 1769.  He had not been a healthy baby and his mother, Letizia, lavished him with care and devotion.  In middle age, he would write about her from St. Helena.
He made friends with a family called Columbier, and would later write of his first flirtation with their daughter, Caroline.
Man, that girl's gonna kill me one day. Viagra ain't working.  My back keep going out... she don't never get enough.  But check this out.  I got to lay some ground rules.  Your my family and I love you.  You're welcome to anything you want in my home. But I don't wanna catch you in the refrigerator or in my Suga bowl... you feel me knocking?
Yeah.
Well, let me in.
Negro, what the hell you doing to my woman?
I don't know, I think I passed out or something.  I don't remember.
Me, too.  You think they're in there?
Stretch it out.
Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend.
What's the green stuff poking out?
Man, this a cool house.
Just a little.
You see that?
Naw.  I bet'cha it's something better than air.
Naw, you go first.
Hello, remember me?
Why didn't she put'em out?
I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.
I'll be out in about 35-40 minutes!
What's the matter?
I gotta get'em fixed.  They don't roll down.
See you later, Day-Day.  Come by after work, I got the John Blaze shit for you.
Why for?  Them boys are real player haters.
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
Let it go, Roach, trust me.
Call me.
What?!  This look like a 7-11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
Shut up!  Both of you right now!
Get on.
I'll take you later.
Are you going to take me to see Mom?
I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
You come way out here to get into more trouble.  You could've stayed at home.
What about that ugly dog?
What's the matter?
Elroy, what happen?
That's my girl.
Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego.  It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops.  Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money.
I appreciate that.
If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.
I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
I...1 would like to...thank you, Mister Wat... Gene.
Good luck.
The gun...
How am I supposed to get away?
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
My wife always said I had a problem trusting people.
Yes, you're right, I don't understand.
No! You can't! They're in on it.
I don't know.
I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him.  We will.
But...
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?
No way.
All right.
All right. Kisses to you.
Mister, what are you dragging me into?
This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
Oh, Jesus ...
It's about time I did. I was one of those guys, workaholics. I worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.  That's just what I thought I was supposed to do.
Keep the change.
For the last time, I don't want it cleaned. Now get the hell out of here!
Fuckin' A.
He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a
Laughs.
I'm not a baby.
Think of it, Ben! With that cursed, bloodied gold!
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
Listen to me son. You got to swear. Swear means promise. First swear you'll take care of little Pearl. Guard her with your life, boy. Then swear you won't never tell where that money's hid. Not even your Mom.
I been mindin' Pearl.
When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?
Don't!
She went.
AAA-MENN!
The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!
Throw that money in the River! In THE RIVER!
Who?
There's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?
Now ain't you relieved, Walt?
Twenty-five wives!
Draggin' the name of the Lord through the evil mud of his soul!
Ain't no sense in it, neither. I figured somethin' like this was brewin' when she went to bed last night.
I tried to save her.
Who's them Blue Men yonder?
John...
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
John, when your Dad says 'come', you should mind him.
She thinks that money's in the river, but you and me, we know better, don't we, boy?
You don't reckon I'd leave you.
Can I have my supper please?
Why, pray tell?
You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?
Why, you're the purtiest girl I've seen in all my wandering. Didn't nobody never tell you that, Ruby?
Didn't you have no inkling?
I was praying.
It's not in the river, is it Harry?
Them kids is yours?
My flesh and blood!
She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.
Somewheres down river! Parkersburg, mebbe! -- Cincinnati! -- One of them Sodoms on the Ohio River.
What are you after them for?
What?
Okay, good. She's asleep.
What the hell's going on!?
M'god, I look twenty years old.  You have any weird dreams last night?
Okay?
Much better.
I heard your ma went ape at the security store today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long's it been since you slept?
My dream.
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
She dreamed this would happen...
Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill.
Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
She lived there.
Get outside and watch her house. If you see anything funny call me.
Maybe god's punishing us all...
Did you sleep?
Great
Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
He's nuts about you.
Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
No, I left everything in Paris. I just happened to be wearing this.
Yes.
Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...
And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!
Is there anything I can do for you, monsieur?
There's something else which I know will appeal to you. A visit to the Paris sewers. They tell me it is extremely instructive.
With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
You think because you represent the former Duchess...
The Duchess...
Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother.
A blue shirt, perhaps?
I am, Gaston.
Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, "Hey, you, d'Algout! from now on it's going to be share and share alike"?
Yes, General Savitzky?
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
Only one in the rear, I'm afraid.
That won't help you! You can't intimidate us!
Halt negotiations immediately. Envoy extraordinary arrives Thursday six ten with full power. Your authority cancelled herewith. Razinin.
It's a real Paris reunion.
Well, I think it's getting late. Good night, Ninotchka.
I am looking for Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
Comrade Buljanoff...
Comrade Kopalski...
Comrade.
Do you know how much a cow costs, Comrade Iranoff?
Now, please, Ninotchka, don't start figuring it out in cows.
Yes, monsieur?
I might be able to accommodate you. Is there some more luggage?
We may have a chance.
Yes, Comrade.
I acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the Power and Light authorities. Whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you.
That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.
What can I do about it?
She has been asked to leave the powder room but without success. We would appreciate if you would see to it yourself.
You want me to go in there?
Private.
I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.
Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
Does that mean that you want me to go there?
Then you don't want me to go there.
Your general appearance is not distasteful.
I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
This is a place for workmen.
Just smile.
Because we are an odd couple.
Two Scotchmen met on the street... and I don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh and the other's was McGillicuddy. McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy," and McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "Hello, Mr. McIntosh," and then McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "How is Mrs. McGillicuddy?" and then McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "How is Mrs. McIntosh?"...
Not funny, huh?
I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?
It's nine o'clock.
If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.
Ninotchka, I love you.
Thursday.
But, darling, you can't do that.
No speech.
I am so happy. No one can be so happy without being punished. I will be punished and I should be punished.  I want to confess, darling.
It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
It's dead.
Who cried that one?
Hello, Leon!
Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?
We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
Oh, Leon!
Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
That wouldn't have done any good. Not with her.  She's the most incredible creature I've ever seen.
That bad?  Old or young?
Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.
Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?
Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
That does it, Swana.  Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.
Not at all.... I understand perfectly, Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You made it very clear, madame.
Good morning.
Please come to the point. What is it you want?
I told you to go, madame.
Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
No.
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
He's right.  Maybe it's time to go to the hang-out route, John.  A full and thorough investigation ... We've cooperated with the FBI, we'll cooperate with the Senate.  What do we have to hide?
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you.
It was her wrist.  And it was through a plate-glass door.
Let's not forget they're just kids, they don't vote.
Jesus!  Did Mitchell know?
Is the war worth it?  Is it worth a one-term presidency?  Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.
The soldiers were provoked.  The students started it, for Christ's sake!
I would personally enjoy doing that, sir.
It'll never wash.  Pardoning them means we're guilty.  The people, the press will go nuts.
Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee.
... Y'know Al, if Hoover was alive none of this would've happened.  He would've protected the President.
Who?
Sir, the deadline is today.
That was civil war.
... they smelled the blood on me this time, Al.  I got soft.  You know ... that rusty, metallic smell ...
Play it tough.  That's the way they play it and that's the way we're going to play it.  Don't lie to Helms and say there's no involvement, but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors, bizarre, without getting into it.  Say the President believes it's going to open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again.  Tell Helms he should call the FBI, call Pat Gray, and say that we wish for the sake of the country -- don't go any further into this hanky-panky, period!
Just do what I say, Bob.
I suppose you thought the Presidency was above this sort of thing.
What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
And not just Hunt.  Frank Sturgis, all those Cubans.  All of them in the Watergate.  They were involved in Track 2 in Cuba.  Hunt reported to my military aide. But I met with him several times as Vice President.  That's what worries the shit out of me.  I don't know how much Hunt knows.  Or the Cubans.
Alright.  But why, if Kennedy is so clean in all this, didn't he cancel Track 2?
Money.  Follow the money.
There's a poison in the upper classes, Bob.  They've had it too soft.  Too many cars, too many color TVs ...
The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ...
You know, they all miss the point. Probably our biggest achievement as an administration, when it's all said and done, isn't China or Russia.  It's pulling out of Vietnam without a right wing revolt.
How?
Please!  I'll never let you down again, Mother.  Never.  I promise.
What'd you say?
Relax, Dick, it's just me ... The desert's so beautiful, isn't it?  I want to go home, Dick.  Time to go home.
You're correct.  I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests, whether they know it or not.  The FBI is worthless in this area.  I want your full concentration on this matter ...
Diem?  Trujillo?  Lumumba?  Guatemala? Cuba? ... It's a shame you didn't take similar precautions, Dick.
Current levels may not be sufficient.
Yes.  And you will give General Cushman full access.
What?
Are you tapping Kissinger?
Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen.
My father built the house where I was born with his own hands.  Oh, it wasn't a big house ...
Jesus, I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office.  He comes in here ranting and raving, dumping his crap all over the place ... Could you prove it, Edgar?
Gentlemen, I tried.  I told Kennedy to go into Cuba.  He heard me and he made his decision.  I appreciate your sentiments.  I've heard them from many fine Cuban patriots, but it's nothing I can do anything about.  Now, it's a long drive back to Dallas tonight, and Trini and I have got an early flight tomorrow to New York ...
No, Henry.  I don't.
Mr. President, this cannot be breathed!  Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.
You have many friends ... and admirers ...
Secret, Mr. Chairman?
Just ... uh ... you know.
Yes.
Why?
Looks can be deceiving ...
What are you going to do about this Allende fellow nationalizing our businesses in Chile?  You gonna send Kissinger down there?
We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.
But I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers.  The documents were old and out of date, like these Pentagon Papers.  The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar.  Then people bought it that he was a spy.  It's the lie that gets you.
Four.  Two boys.  Two girls.  And eight wounded.
Jesus Christ!
... I don't really know you yet, Sandy ... What do you like?  I mean, what kind of clothes do you like?  Do you like blue ... red?
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
But what am I telling the press about Kent State?
Bernstein.
So I'm supposed to be ...
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
Amen to that.
I want a divorce.
I'll do it.  No more.
You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they?  New Hampshire ...
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
Are you okay?
No, you're not.  So stop comparing yourself to him.  You have no reason to ... You have everything you ever wanted. You've earned it.  Why can't you just enjoy it?
No, I don't.  I'm not Jack ...
You don't expect me to believe that for one minute, do you?  Does it matter what's on them? Really? ... Murder, Dick?  Sex?  Your secrets, your fantasies?  Or just me and you and ...
Repartee, Dick -- very good.  Hey, I feel ten years younger!  It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life?
To what?
Let's wait and see how you survive your first crisis, Rocky ...
Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
You heard my -- you havin' fun with me?
I am older.
What would you a done if he'd been released?
...Your granddad never asked me to sign on as deputy. I done that my own self. Loretta says you're quittin'.
...I always thought when I got older God would sort of come into my life in some way. He didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I'd have the same opinion about me that he does.
You don't know what he thinks.
...Shot down on his own porch there in Hudspeth County. There was seven or eight of 'em come to the house. Wantin' this and wantin' that. Mac went back in and got his shotgun but they was way ahead of him. Shot him down in his own doorway.  Aunt Ella run out and tried to stop the bleedin'. Him tryin to get hold of the shotgun again. They just set there on their horses watchin' him die. Finally one of 'em says somethin' in Injun and they all turned and left out. Well Mac knew the score even if Aunt Ella didn't. Shot through the left lung and that was that. As they say.
It's all the goddamned money, Ed Tom. The money and the drugs.  It's just goddamned beyond everything. What is it mean? What is it leading to?
Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.
Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway.
...You ride Winston.
I know this truck. Belongs to a feller named Moss.
Yessir. Wasn't none.
No sir.
Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock?
Yessir. It was punched out.
You gonna drive out there?
How's that, Sheriff?
...I love you more'n more, ever day.
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
It ain't even three years we been married.
No.
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
No. But I gave my word.
...Where'd you get the pistol?
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
Yeah.
Goin' where?
Why all the way to Del Rio?
Yes I do.
Hey.
I don't know, I had the sheriff here from Terrell County --
What did you tell him?
She'll be all right.
If you knew, you would have it with you.
I do know to a certainty. And you know what's going to happen now. You should admit your situation. There would be more dignity in it.
What's this about?
I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?
...I know where you are.
Yeah? Where am I?
You know she won't be there.
I didn't mean nothin' by it.
This was my wife's father's place. Originally.
We lived in Temple Texas for many years. Raised a family there. In Temple. We come out here about four years ago.
You married into it.
Call it.
Just call it.
Look... I got to know what I stand to win.
Everything.
Twelve gauge. You need shells? Moss looks the gun over.
What kind of tent?
Good. I need everything else.
I want you to take me to another motel.
When did you last see him.
How well do you know Chigurh.
You want to change rooms?
...Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you.
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
Not that way.
I don't mean braze.
Yeah. I was in Nam.
Why would he go to Odessa?
No no. No. You don't understand. You can't make a deal with him. Even if you gave him the money he'd still kill you. He's a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that. He's not like you. He's not even like me.
No sir.
She's in a kind of shock. I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.
...I meant your food.
I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?
I thought you said the eggs weren't...
Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!
Bad idea...
I questioned Joyce about all this...
Anyway, so what?
A woman can write a check.
Oww, the arm, the arm!
You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.
Oh. How come?
...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
I am?
Umm, I don't think that...
I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
Of course, I don't know every doctor who works here...
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
Let me know if you need anything, okay?
Do what?
I guess we all did.  You know, I didn't marry Leslie because I loved her. I married her to forget you...
I don't think your friend likes me.
My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
What?
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
Shut up, Merle... Williams.
What's his real name?
What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it...  But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?
She called you 'George,' George.
He has no heartbeat!
You don't sound like you're from here.
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.
You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So, how'd it go today? You find him?
Hey, how 'bout a card for me? What is that?  "Please call if you have any information on David Ravell." This is my phone number! How many of these have you given out?
Shhh! I heard you the first time.
Are you sure I can borrow this?
Your husband?!
These guys are here to help you, Betty.
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
The fuck you talking about?
You did not just say "Injuns," Del.
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken.
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.
Hell of a way to die.
We can live with that.
I hope you're right...
You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
What? What does she represent?! What could some cornbread white bitch from Kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up and down the Louisiana Purchase possibly mean to you?!! I'd just love to know...
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
What?
I need to get my goddamn head examined.  You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me!
Wesley...
Who's this?
Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her...
Don't  Don't you talk about Betty like that. I don't care who she ends up being, you never use that word again. Got it?
I said 'got it?'
...yeah, I got it.  Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
I don't know, George...
This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
Yeah? The sport utility?
Would you say she was ambitious?
You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
- and share one of your graves.
No, they never did turn me into a toad.
Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
Them straw polls is ugly.
Latch right on to that tit.
McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.
Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st.  Today's the 17th!
The hell it ain't square one! Ain't no one gonna pick up three filthy unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em a know-it-all that can't keep his trap shut!
Well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof! They're playin' it as far away as Mobile! The whole damn state's goin' ape!
It was a powerful air.
Daddy!
Mama said you was hit by a train!
Thank you, sir!
To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.
Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
I knew you'd make it!  Where's your girl? Didn't she come?
Hey, baby, you could get sent to war, get your ass shot down.
Don't lose any sleep over it. I wouldn't mind being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat.
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night.  Survival of the fittest.
What's your name, boy?
Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.
I know.
You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy?
No, sir!
No, sir.
Now when I say "understand" I want the whole group to say, "Yes, sir!" Understand?
Stop eyeballing me, boy! You are not worthy enough to look your superiors in the eye. Use your peripheral vision! Understand?!
I don't know what it is. It could be anything.
Is this you boys first night of liberty since you got here?
What would you girls like to do? Want to stick around here for a little or... or could I suggest another plan...?
Exactly how late are you, Lynette?
Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.
Sid, there's no baby.
Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
You hope.
My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.
Do you go to school?
There's always a choice.
I don't know who you think you're talking to! I ain't some whore you brought here! I've been trying to be your friend and you treat me like shit!
You stayed after all.
God.
The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that.
Zack, do you ever think about what it'd be like to have kids... a family.
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.
Twenty-two years ago.
You told us it would grow out an inch.
Nice, hospitable folks they get around here.  I hope she comes.
I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her.
Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.
Okay, but what if it's like Foley said and she got knocked up, to trap you -- is it still your responsibility?
You should see the look on your face.
The fuck did you do that for?!
That's right.
I can't just...
Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you.  You can wait a half hour, can't you?
You're wasting your fucking time, man, you're wasting my time.  You don't know how to do this, and the longer we stay in here, the more likely she's gonna lose it and call the cops!
Let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.
You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one.  Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that.
Get the fuck away from me.
I mean, right?  Isn't it?
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
It's still a good plan.  It's just... got a twist.
They're coughing.
Yeah?
Can we come in?
One day you will learn to respect other people's time, Lydia, one day you --
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  We can still handle this.  Can we still handle this?
"Half?"  What did you, take a nap in math class?  Three people, three shares, one third.  Four point six six six repeating.
Shoulda got an apartment.
He's going down.
What do we do?
We're not coming out.  We're not letting you in.  Get out of my house. 
Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
No.
He'll do something.
Uh uh.
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three..."
Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?
I'm sorry, Mom.
Alma!? I uhh I don't think...
Okay now, er, Huey, so what's your telephone number?
Free? We're back where we started. Shit we still don't have a stop light.
Man, El-Rage is El-Rage. You know him.
Hold up a second... We got a decision to make.
Why didn't you tell us about the party you boys were planning at the capitol?
Who's they?
Aaaah, Bitter Motherfucker... I almost forgot how nasty that shit is.
Have to pass on the revolution today man, I got class... But how about tonight, I was gonna check out "Cloud Nine." Just like old times.
PE? What? You guys doing gym class?
...Glad you came man.
You want me to put a man on it?
One: "We want freedom. We want the power to determine the destiny of our Black Community." Two: "We want full employment for our people." Three: "We want to end the robbery by the white man of our Black Community." Christ, they're asking for reparations...
These are memos from the commissioner, the mayor and Hoover himself, putting the Black Panthers and their subversive activities under the full jurisdiction of the Bureau.
And did you witness the shoot-out?
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
Well, then we're going to take that power away from those bastards.
That's right brother... listen and learn.
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.
We'll get them. Right now we got to worry about being armed and ready to protect Betty Shabazz. Those phonies sure as hell can't. We need guns.
Huey man I got to talk with you...
A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
Judge... we're doing security for Betty Shabazz's visit next week. I'd like to have someone who knows there way around a pistol there. Someone like you.
Yeah... let me think about it.
Yeah... You were a lot of help with those guns. Your soldier shit is bad- ass.
Hey, GI bill pays for school. And shit, if I stuck around here, instead of signing up, I'd probably be in jail, or sitting on the stoop drinking Bitter Dog with Rose, you know?
Me? You've got a whole lot of other folks signing up. Why me?
Aw... uh... it's was just harassment. My driver's license expired.
Fuck is up?!
God damn it's him. I gotta go.
You don't look alright.
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
Do you think Frances with an "e" is too manly a name for a girl?
Do you think Francis with an "i" is too womanly a name for a boy?
I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
I expect to try.
Am I one of that sort?
I know him well enough?
Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.
I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?
Colonel Tarleton, you deal with these damned rebels.
Perhaps.
Do you see that, Colonel?
Have you seen any Redcoats?
Is it?
Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?
That's right.
You don't hate him.
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
I stand corrected.
And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield.  Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive.  A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga.  The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.
Not me, you.  I'm going north with every Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he won't last six weeks.
Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently.
You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that...
How far away?
We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
Margaret, take William and Susan to the river shed.  Hide there.  If we're not back by dawn, go up the river to the Richardson's house. They'll take you to your Aunt Charlotte's farm.  Nathan, Samuel, and I are going to get Gabriel.
Gray.
Father... I killed those men...
Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite.
What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?
Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
Ellie...God doesn't do things like that. I know you loved y'brother, but--
Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something really bad. He--
Yeah, I know...how are things out there in Chicagoland?
At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.
Ellie--
Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
You need a glass?
That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there.
Not yet...how much further is it?
It's Church.
I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
Does she love the cat?
Whose burying ground?
Why? For God's sake, why?
I guess so...but...
But--
No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie.
I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I--
The movers--
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be excused. Go and wash your face.
I heard you tonight.
I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
That boat is my livelihood!
Aye, aye, sir!
You see, I've got this honest streak in me -- in its own way, a sort of curse.  Oh, and there's the fact that you have no choice.
Wait as long as you like.
I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end well for you.
The situation has changed.
Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?
Now?
Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.  Best play it safe, and spill it all.
Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me.  As a wedding gift.
Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.
Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate --
Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
Miss Swann.
You are despicable.
Come on!
Has it changed since the last time you were here?
He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.
A fool's errand.
I'll tell lee.  Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts.  This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --
We're not going to just surrender!
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs.  If you're steersman's good enough, that is.
No.
Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
Because you're a pirate.
Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!
He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
Depends.
Miss Swann!  We're here to rescue you!  It's going badly!
Do you have any idea where you're going?
Are you certain this is the right way?
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
Yes.
Please.
Have you found Dr. Bright?
I suppose you are going to tell me where it is going.
This is our world, Susan, and once you realize that, you will understand that the only place our path can end is on the throne of heaven.  Science is the quest for divine perfection.
... plastic.
You can't do this!  You owe me, O'Brien.  I made you plastic!  I made you!
Like rotting meat.
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
Poppy, are you in one of your moods again?
If you loved me like I loved you?
The fact is, that the milk has been spilled and now we need you to tell us how to clean it up.
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
Excellent work, Dr. Nebbleman.  You have outdone yourself.
Hey!
You better quit pushing me, pal.
A man?
Yeah.  But it wasn't a group.  It was one man.
What did security say?
There's a guard outside my door! I'm a prisoner, Nigel!  Do you understand that?
I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research.
Daniel...
The big house.
It already is.
I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up!  If you're gonna flip your wig --
You think it's a coincidence that they have all these aisles lined up like this, like a little maze! We're all lab rats running through their maze, pulling lever A or lever B, each designed to create some kind of bio-chemical dependency.  All the while they're everywhere, watching us, two-way mirrors, surveillance cameras, nodding to each other, making little notes.
Please, Susan!  I need help! Something is wrong with me!
But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
Yes.
We don't have time for hysterics.
The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being.
Look at this!
Do you have something to bring me down?
The nanobot... it's not here...
What did you want my hair for?
Oh no.  They're trying to blame you for the accident.  That means they must not have been able to control the replicators.
I didn't know what was going to happen.  I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.
It's too late.  Argon injected it.
What would happen if I threw him into the core?
That's impossible.
And you have him?
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds.
won't even pretend it isn't a very great favor. I wish there was something I could do for you—
My name is Smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. I've never been in jail - that is, not often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
You have the cutest nose I've—
It isn't cheap. It's nice.
Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too!
Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters—
Gallagher!
Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?
Your house?
Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to.
Ah-ah-ah!
Who is it you wish to see, sir?
I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.
Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.
Well, Stew, that's all thrashed out. By golly, I'm surely glad to see that you're not really sore. You know our racket - after all, news is news.
Well - it's only April.
What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
Just a boid in a gilded cage -
A what?
Oh no, sir!
Quite so. Quite.
Stew, your hands are shaking. You've been drinking again.
You're sure going to be poison to that Junior Leaguer[4] from now on!
You what?
On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
There you go, talking like a woman!
Well!
Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes?
Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name.
Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
How is her family going to feel about it?
Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
My mistake - she's glaring.
They all consider me just as one of the boys.
Conrad.
Right.
You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
Here you are.
Traps shut!
Thanks. May I sit down?
Come in, Joe. It's all right.
I'm sorry nobody could come.
Now, now Jeeves.[5] Was that nice? Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves? Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't it?
I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue. It's so flattering.
Looks just like it did.
Thank you.
And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
Where'd you get this?
Bud?
Look at me George. That meeting's not for me. Look at my face.
It's fine. You'll put on some make up and ...
Sure is pretty.
What's the matter?
What'll it be?
No. What?
And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.
Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
What color is that hedge of yours?
The other one?
We're supposed to be in school.
JENNIFER!
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
Not directly anyhow ...
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
Can I ask you a question?
Are you sure?
This thing works. We could go home right now.
They just grow like that?
Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.
WAIT A MINUTE!!
What do you mean?
There's worse places.
Oh hi!
Well ... I'm not sure I see the point anymore.
You know what I really like?
... What's that?
Aren't you a little early?
TV repair?
Yeah. TV busted?
So you can't talk to me?
And what was this?
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
Hey, what are you doing? Why are you wearing a suit again?
It's not cool?
What?
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
No she didn't; that's a lie.
Are you watching a porno movie?
Do you like porno movies?
...just talking to you....
It doesn't matter.
What do you mean, "really?" Yeah. Really. What about you?
...yeah.....
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
Yeah....do you do well, do you make alotta money?
So.....are you stroking it, yet, honey?
Well why don't you take your pants off and stroke it for me?
Hey. What are you doing? How are you?
Hi....what....what's up....?
It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
You lied to me?
Why did you tell me you did, then?
It was cool last night.
I don't know.
Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice.
Really?
I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --
I'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?
This is funny.
That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?
So that was your pudding?
Did something happen; are you alright?
So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
Ok. Well call me when you get back, I mean, I'll call you when I get back. I'll be back for three weeks and then I go away for a month after that. So maybe in that time....
Hi.
That was good.
Ok.
HI. WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE?
Yes.
When was the last time you had a girlfriend?
What's that? What is that that you're doing?
Where do you have to go?
Are you ok?
I'm sorry.
If you give me six to eight weeks I can redeem the mileage and then I can with you wherever you have to travel......
I'm fine, I have your work number.
Well who did?
I didn't do it.
-- it's $2.99 per minute for the first half hour and $1.99 per minute after that.
......and this is confidential?
And your name?
Can you say that my name is Jack?
Why don't you shut the fuck up?
I'm a nice and reasonable man. I didn't do anything wrong. Please don't make me hurt you. And I'm telling you: that if you ever hurt me or if you hurt someone that I love.....I will hurt you many, many, many times over.....because it's not right to take people's trust.
Yeah.
It's alright.
This is Janice the operator, who's this?
What is this?
Hi, Lance.
Yeah.
What do you have in the house?
Yes I am.
Ok.
As soon as you want.
Nothing.
Put him through.
Are you sure?
So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?
I'm sorry. You're right.
Should I call you later?
My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
"And so the Professor lifted Colombe's skirt high, above her waist. 'Let me be your Tutor,' said he, 'in the ways of love.' With that, he slid her pantalettes down, down, down over her knees, and there -- nestled between her legs -- as pink as a tulip, as slick as an eel --"
I was wrong to free him, but so are you -- for taking all his treasures -- his quills and his ink --
The Doctor's a respected man, a friend of the court --
If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself --
It's not even a proper novel! It's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions! Frankly, it even fails as an exercise in craft. The characters are wooden; the dialogue is inane. Not to mention the endless repetition of words like "nipple" and "pikestaff" --
And such puny scope! Nothing but the very worst in man's nature!
You mean to take us all down with you?
I have a proposition.
That's enough.
That's a Turkish weave, you numbskull; it costs more than you'll earn in your lifetime --
If it were up to the Doctor, you'd be flayed alive.
Oh, I'm to be blamed now, am I?
Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
Madame Bougival; Mademoiselle Clairwil -- and of course -- the Marquis' wife --
You'll get more from her with kindness than you will with force.
But I am history.
Here it is; the last chapter.
What have they done to you now?
Yes; that's it! A final volley from us both!
You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
I am not a wealthy woman.
If you're truly determined to step out of the shadow of your husband's celebrity --
If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails --
You've no right to assault me in this fashion; I'll call for my footman. I'll have you removed --
Hm? Tell me. What other treats?
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
Doesn't that please you?
Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
The character that's supposed to be me, Susan Alexander--
There. That's right.
The Journal was pretty harsh to Roosevelt today.
Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
I will not defend my life to you--
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
You needn't use that language with me
There's a different between want and
That's right. You've captured me exactly. Goodnight.
You will not walk out on me
I don't want you to--
Sir?
He lied to me
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
Tome it's a question of truth and illusion. Don't you get tired of the errant falsity in motion pictures?
You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
You drink at 10 am, do you?
Nix, sweetie. You shelve it
I don't know what you expected with Joseph- fucking-Conrad for Chrissake. I mean this is Hollywood, pal.
I don't wanna write about no spic.
Mank-
When I was a kid I wanted to scorch the world too - - I had all kinda dreams about making great pictures and telling great stories. But all that's finished for me--
I'm sorry.
Hedy Lamarr?
Me, I'm proud to be a Jew, I got no problem. You don't like it, fuck you. But with these guys it's like a dirty word. All they wanna be is good red- white-and-blue Americans, and the way they see it you can't be a good American and a Jew. So Sam Goldfish becomes Sam Goldwyn and David Selznick becomes David 0. Selznick -- like anyone's gonna think he's Irish for fuck's sake--
You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
And they went to the stockholders in New York.
Well, this is a great pleasure. Miss Davies! I just saw that ENCHANTMENT is playing at a the Tivoli, the revival house in Santa Monica. That was a fine picture!
It came.
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
"Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I
For Christ's sake, shut up--
Look, not a single scene shot in the studio! We've found natural locations for the whole story--
They wanna talk to you.
Just come by to wish you luck.  Need anything?
What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?
You were a big favorite in this fight. Then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog.
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know...
Harder.  Take the towel off.
Whadda you care?
Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you.
You want us to wait for you?
I just weighed myself -- I'm 161. No more deals like this Janiro bullshit. I didn't tell you to do it in the first place.
What do you mean?
I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...
Yeah, except fall down. That's right.
Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am I gonna do for seven months? I'm gonna go crazy. How do I keep my strength? By that time I'll be too weak to win the title. And my weight? Forget about it -- I'm gonna blow up like a balloon. I ain't never gonna hold my weight down. Seven months! I don't know...
What? I just said hello. Since when I can't kiss my sister-in-law?
When?
Why didn't you tell me about it?
No, I just told you what happened.
You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
What do you mean, "you"?
You're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... You wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month.
I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.
I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
I'm not interested in him.
Yeah.
I never noticed his face.
What'd you see?
You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it.
I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club.
I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
What are you doing?
C'mon, Tommy --
Never felt better.
All right, lemme ask you something. Let's say I was a good friend of yours. And I was telling you I was gonna bet a lot of money on you in this Janiro fight. What would you tell me?
I can't convince him. He's got such a thick head, I'd like to crack it open myself. Believe me, my own brother. It's very hard. You don't have to convince me -- I know we should be with Tommy. You talk to him. He don't listen to nobody.
What're you doin' with Salvy? You shouldn't be here with him. Jake's away killin' himself. Suppose he found out.
Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time.
Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.  Get me L. B. Jefferies.
Like disposing of their wives?
Mrs. -- Thorwald's -- clothes. -- Clean -- carefully packed -- not too stylish -- but presentable.
You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder?
You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
-- until yesterday morning.
Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.
Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!
Ever get an answer?
But I'm not a killer!
Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
I told you that --
Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it.
In sections! And one other thing, doubting Tom -- it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long distance! If he called his wife the day she left -- after she arrived in Merritsville -- why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?
Congratulations, Jeff.
For what?
Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour?
You asked for something dramatically different! You got it!
So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.
I'll -- I'll get married. Then I'll never be able to go anywhere.
Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff.
That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
I don't want to.
I'm not ready for marriage.
Stella!
What about this morning? Any developments?
You mean the one the dog was sniffing around?
Smart girl.
How much do you think you'll need?
What about the rest?
Anything else bothering you?
That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
Going on right here. It's a big night.
It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.
Tired?
Jeff -- isn't it time you came home? You could pick your assignment.
How can you tell that -- from here?
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.
There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa. You have the town in the palm of your hand.
I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.
Tell me about it.
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.
What makes you think something's wrong with her?
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.
That alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost --
Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women.
Don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker. I wish he'd get there, though.
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
Do you like it?
I'll try to give you at least fifteen minutes.
A new disease.
Feel okay?
What's happening?
I like you, you know?
We got a cookaboo inside.  He wounded some kid earlier.
He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!
You still want to go home, Moose?
I don't see what's so bad about taking a little drink.
Excuse us a minute?
He's just loaded, honey.
Frank!
John Crawford?
Do you know why you shot those puppies, John?  Is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?
Can you tell me why you killed the puppies, Plato?
No, sir.  I just went next door to look at them like I always do. They were nursing on their mother and I did it.  I guess I'm just no good?
I think his first name's Ray--I have to see him.  It's very important.
I'll wait for him.
He has a knife.
I got to go in.  You better get home too.  Hey--what?
They're looking for you!--
I'm here.  Shut up.
Haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
What you run out on me for!  What you leave me alone for?
Why?
Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away.
'Bye, Mom.
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
Too bad you didn't connect.  You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?
That why you moved from the last town? 'Cause you were in trouble? You can talk about it if you want to--I know about it anyway. Routine check.
You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it?
They think I'll make friends if we move.  Just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
What a zoo!
What?
Bully for you.
You don't have to be unfriendly.
Now that's true!
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
Oh, Jim!
Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
Here we are-- out of cigarettes-- Junior's in the nurs'ry-- See how late it gets--
I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
We have to go back!
Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere.
Children?  Well, we really don't encourage them.  They're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree?
What?
Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near there!
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
You said you'd call my father.
We were romantic then too--
Didn't you forget something?
I was talking to Dad.
You better be here to be good to her, loverboy. 'Cause she's been good to you.
All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters...
Searching for a money man...
Y'know something, baby? If you were my sister? I'd still want to wake up Christmas morning with you...
Radio said negative five.
Saw me --
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick.  Hurry up!
Ash, you've gotten me enough --
I'll see what I can do.
I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore.
He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters.
You motherfucker.
Nick, no --
Get the hell off of me!
You're in on this.
If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!
So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?
They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
They've never done a robbery?
That guy knows you?
You saved my life.  You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me.
You're the getaway girl. The money's gonna get to you eventually. Gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. But I can't do that without a gun. Any luck talking to him?
I'm glad it was me.
Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
She says a lot of things.
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
What's her greatest fear?
I don't know.
Hey, it's... been two years --
They wouldn't have changed the security setup.
Ten dollars? What do I do with ten dollars?
Got something to say to me, Nick?
No, you're not.
Thanks, sister. How are ya.
How long ago was your makeover?
There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin...
Ain't there yet.
I'm just talking.
She's using a new perfume.
Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...
GUARD!!!
What? No...
There is no other table --
I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
You fuckin' wish.
You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot -
You're coming back to work for us, right?
Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem.
Bullshit.
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
Say "hello" to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?
What?
I'm sorry.
How is he?
Then one day she meets a John Holmes motherfucker, and it's like, whoa baby. This mother fucker's like Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape." He's diggin' tunnels. Now she's gettin' this serious dick action, she's feelin' something she ain't felt since forever. Pain.
When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Mr. Pink.
Your name's Freddy something.
Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
For what, the cops?
Have you guys been listening to K- BILLY's super sounds of the seventies weekend?
I'd go over twelve percent for that.
Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
I haven't had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there. And after we got away, I've just been dealin' with him.
You're right, this is bad.  How did you get out?
I got 'em, all right?
What?
I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit.
So what is it?
We can't take him to a hospital.
So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.
Well, he knows a little about me.
Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful -
We ain't taking him to a hospital.
...Hey, I know what I'm talkin' about, black women ain't the same as white women.
Hello Graham -- Joe -- Mr. Gardner.
Who shot who?
But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
Yes, ma'am.
We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.
Of course it'll work. You can get another girl to fill out the act.
Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.
Coffee?
You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you?
No, I'm not all right. I'm soaked and I hit myself against that rock.
So grab yourself some sleep while you have the chance.
So did I. They were in it.
How does she draw?
You must be plenty worried about Lednov sneakin' up on us.  Think he will?
At the ranch maybe?
That's Lednov!  We come along here.
They sure must have been travelin'. This keeps up we can start a store.
I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.
Oh... that's the time you went away.
Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?
I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
How's that?
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know you had a daughter.
Not if I know Mary. When she rides into Sonora, you'll be with her. And mighty glad to be there after this. I don't see how you stood it as long as you did.
Go away -- please.
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
You're sure there's more where this came from?
Aspen doesn't want us Mr. Graham. They threw us out.
That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
Why, yes. They're all I need...
I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids.
-- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!
Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
No.
She was only teasin'.
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
Help!
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
I meant you're into ghosts.
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
Sure. We can practice talking.
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
Stop it! I'm just trying to say I think we should take our friendship to the next level.
Oh.
Stop! --
My child, you're alive!
We? What do you mean... we?
Left, right, left, right, crossover kick...
Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!
What are you getting at, Professor?
Good idea, and don't forget to give her a good-night kiss.
I also took the liberty of putting those with near-death experiences on top.
How are we going to get them all up there?
So, if one of our little chickadees is taking a shower which one of these buttons do I press to get a close- up?
The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.
That's why we came here, remember?
Work, work, work. Is that all that you do?
You do.
It's the best seat in the house. I warmed it up for you.
Father.
Remember, don't ask her too many questions.
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
Get out?! What does it say?
BLOOD FEAST!
It's the influence of all those family films.  Right, Mom?  Hey, Mom??... 
 I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!
What is it, officers? My patient is waiting.
You've been working in that video shop too long.
Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.
I certainly did.
MOTHERFUCKER!!
I certainly was not!
Did you see her?! She just said "Fuck you" to me!
I... I'm not sure...  ...I... oohhh... Excuse me...
I do, please.
It's him!
It's just not your day, is it Rosemary?
Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
What is it, Betty?
Young man, this Faberge Egg is chipped.
Sure I do.
Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee
Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?
You're a curious man. You're willing to jeopardize Jacqueline's life in order to satisfy your own curiosity.
She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
"The Dante?"
Well, if it's fun for you, it's all right. I get a kick out of my work when the customers aren't too crabby.
Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
The tip is, anyhow. I like to work on your hair.
I'd like that.
What brought you down here, Greg?
Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.
Gregory ——  you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight.
You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.
I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
Who are you?
And then?
If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me.
Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."
Yes.
I have to go —-
You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
Jason, my pet ——
What a peculiar question.
Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet ——	one as a detective.
It's my cloven hoof. It trips me up sometimes.
I'd hardly describe It that way —- The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.
I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice —— that's it, isn't it?
Are we?	I thought I was very gay.
Mrs. Redi, there's one thing —-with Jacqueline gone, how do you carry on the business? What do you do with the receipts? How do you sign checks--?
There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?
She's not been here for a long time.
False alarm.
No. Why?
Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.
I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen.
Why do you say I'm self-conscious?
Ann. Hello.
What kind of personal project?
Donna?
Yes.
Can we look at one?
The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
And they just answer them?
I know.
What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
Tell me your name.
You don't know what I'm thinking.
Is he going to see this?
Yes.
Then as far as this taping goes, you have nothing to worry about.
Yes.
So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
And you feel the same way with John?
If you were in love with me, would you?
Not entirely.
Like maybe a big part?
Whoa!! I'm so glad we got that on tape!! You won't answer a question about Elizabeth, but I have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life!! Graham, what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? Are you going to tell her about them? I can't imagine her being too understanding about that. But since you don't lie anymore, you'll have to say something.
Why not?
I want to know why you are the way you are!
Well, are you?
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
Why don't I believe you?
You've made your point.
Well, I don't know. The week started off okay, but then I was outside watering the plants, and I started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the Greenhouse Effect, so I went inside and turned on the air-conditioner full blast, and that made me feel a little better until I started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor, and --
No, I haven't.
Is he still at your house?
It's possible that Graham has hidden motives for disliking therapy and/or therapists. Perhaps he has problems of his own that he is unwilling to deal with, and he would like to see other people, you for instance, wallow in their situation just as he does. Do you think that's possible?
Do you feel there is more progress to be made?
Uh-huh. So what's he look like?
Why, so you can go after him?
Besides, even if I decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours?
Do you have to say that?
Let me talk to him first.
I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
He just asked me questions.
I wanted him to see me.
No, but I did.
Listen to you!! You sound like Mom. What are you talking about?
Here it is.
No, I touched me.
Do I know you?
Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.
No, I really can't. I find it healthy never to characterize people I don't know or conversations I haven't heard. I don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else. Last time I saw Ann she left here very... confused, I would say. And upset.
I don't understand. Why did you want to come here? I mean, I can't imagine Ann painted a very flattering portrait of me.
Well, they must be something sexual, because Ann gets freaked out by that shit. Are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something?
Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?
That's all.
How do we start?
Were you disappointed?
Would you like me to take my pants off?
If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
Do you think I'm pretty?
I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me.
I can't let my lunch hour go on too long. I've already skipped one meeting.
Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
How about inviting me over to dinner?
Well, this is timely. Your wife is here, would you like to speak to her?
I felt like it, so what? Goddam, you and Ann make such a big deal out of it.
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
It won't. I trust him.
Student?
Everybody has a past.
Get rid of the car when you get your apartment, then you'll still have one key.
God, you need help.
I need help? Whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, Graham? Not me, buddy. You're the fucking nut. Now show me those tapes.
No.
One moment.
He said immediately.
No, nothing.
I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic.
I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
Will you be OK now? I've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. I've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
Go back to their apartment with them and treat her for second-degree burns. It'll have to do for now.  What's your number? The number of your apartment?
Rollo, you know me. Once a GP, always a GP.
It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn't handle them. That girl, that Annabelle -- talk about crazy projects.
Yes?
It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
Huh?
GOT THE HOT FLUSH SYMPTOMS AND I'M FEELING FREAKY
GOT MY HEM SO HIGH THEY'LL SAY I'M BEING CHEEKY
BREAKING OUT
About Brad's family?
Infantile regression.
SIN-I-FUL
With Fast Food Farley at the helm it'll be TV dinners from now on.
Overreact!  You're the one with theories about conspirac...  Oliver?
Look.  Look at that.  Bert Schnick can see.  Why...he's...dancing.
Did you /hear/ that, Oliver.
Care to indulge?
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
Oh, Harry.  What are we going to do?
Absolutely correct.
It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
I'm sorry, Officer.
No!  He's never done that before.
Brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you.
F for...
Ah.  Mr. And Mrs. Majors.  How wonderful to see you.  I am Dr. Cosmo McKinley and this is my sister, and colleague, Nation McKinley.
And none of them worked?
It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.
You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?
Why are you being so defensive?
Miles.
What do you think?
You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
Highliner.
They're just leftovers.
Now there's a girl who knows how to pour. What's your name?
Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
I can explain.
Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
And?
Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't --
Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.
This is rose, right?
Huh.
What do you smell?
Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it.
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
You know her?
Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.
Perfect.
The girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash? Jesus, Miles!
Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
She what?  When?
You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.
Get the trunk.
Please just try to be your normal humorous self, okay? Like who you were before the tailspin. Do you remember that guy? People love that guy. And don't forget -- your novel is coming out in the fall.
And don't drink too much. I don't want you going to the dark side or passing out. Do you hear me? No going to the dark side.
We were supposed to play golf.
You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
With Maya.
I said okay?
You have to tell me --
I don't have to.
Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.
Let me use your phone.
That's thoughtful.
What's it look like to you?
What's that?
Me?
Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
You said it looked like a car accident.
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
Hey.
Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.
Is she sleeping or...?
Got it.
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
Good. So did I.
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
About two-thirty.
He's an actor, so it can't be good.
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
That was big of him.
That's great.
How much skin and stem contact?
Sir, what are you doing?
Do you feel comforted?
What's furry, furry rabbit?
What are you doing?
So the aliens can't read our minds.
What do you think about the idea that they don't like places near water, and we might be safe from them near a lake or something?
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
The footprints.
She's not in an ambulance Father.
They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.
Forget it.
You must have known that before you came.
We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack.  He said he'd... look into it.  I can't believe he's the law out here. Now I see why you all wear guns.
This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?
Looks like that's not all they admired.
Yeah?
What about the law?
Why?
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
There are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them.  Are these your friends?
You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.
What's all this then?
Who's going to pay for all this, Sheriff?
It's none of your business.
They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
What about his brother?
So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
I thought we talked about that.
I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella.
What's she got to do with it?
My compliments to you, Miss Stella. This is what I call a saloon.
You like a good saloon?
It's the only place I'm happy.
I'm saving lives here. The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.
Nah!  What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it?  Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.
How about you?
That was my plan.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
But not everyone's imaginary, are they, Mr. Taransky?  I refer, of course, to Edith.
It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
It's the truth.  Those 17 superstars are our insurance policy.  We can't open -- can't make a profit without them.
We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!
Good to see you too, Elaine.
I don't know if that's going to happen.
No problem.  Do you want to come in?
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.
Not today.  She's learning her lines.  You can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget.
-- I can explain.
Viktor, you should have said something.
Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start.
Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday. How embarrassing.  I don't know what I was thinking.  With all the excitement lately...  Am I interrupting something?  Are you expecting company?
Not if I don't let her.
Where are you?
Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing here.
Well, I --
Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?
You look so, so...
What?... What did you say?
You don't secretly want the attention?
With everything that was going on in my life, I just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- I needed time.  Viktor bought me that time.  I owe him so much.
You never were together, Hal.
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
How will you do our love scenes?
Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!
But she's right there!  I must feel her!
No.  In fact, between us, she doesn't really exist.
-- Please, get away from me.
Good for you, Hank.
It can -- with my new computer code, you and me, we can do it together.
"Straw God" changed my life.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
Do I hear the sound of... wedding bells?
Don't feel too bad.  Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her.  You're better off out of it.
Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?
I do.
Okay, Dad.
Dad, you know I don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now.  She broke up with Kent.
I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.
Don't you?
Well, we got some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of your fingerprints... but none of hers.
Mr. Sayer...
Yes.
You know what I'm talking about.
Do you know how important this is? This is big time.  I'm going to read it for you, doctor.
Why, Malcolm?
On my way to the flea market in Amish country. Thought maybe you want to come. Show me how to buy at these things.
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
What was that you were saying before with your soldiers? Day pro fun.
I walk this way to school with Tommy Tammisimo.
You ever tell her about how it is with Tommy?
When?
It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.'  Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?
She came a long way to visit me, didn't she?
Lots of things.
You'd cry. Cause you miss grandma so much.
I don't like people looking at me like that.
Meaning?
Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
Slut.
Hey! Don't use all the hot water!
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
Looks like the alternator.
How would you know? You're looking at my tits.  Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!
There's something weird going on here, Suzie.
You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
Come on --
Missed you at church this morning, Jeremiah.
Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
Curt Cobain.
You're out of your mind, man.
Hmmm. This shit isn't bad.
So... what does it do?
We've got to call someone -- get the sheriff--
What are you going to do? Shoot me?
Maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel.
Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
Yeah?
This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
Let it go.
Bill, we need to talk!
Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked.
Sorry.
Grant, where'd you go?
Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
My father, he was -- he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse. Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck.
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
We'll just head up here into Bishopville, get checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all, huh?
Rorschach.
Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog
Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
He's teaching environmental science, Grant. Probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester.
But not always. I was -- He was... other stuff too.
Look, you make this little run for me, I'll buy you a new rig.
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
An existentialist.
Having fun.
I give up.
Your honeymoon would've never been this exciting.
Christ, what channel are we on?...
See ya, Kate.
You could've asked.
Mississippi's the other way!
Yeah?
Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
Go.
Now, if I say go to channel three, it really means go to six.
Six. Got it.
Yeah?
You know how to drive one of these things?
Save it. We got a long haul.
Do I have a choice?
I hate to say it...
Then don't.
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
Bandit two, I gotta make a quick pit stop.
Just fine. What's the weather like?
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
Talk to me.
I'm all ears.
Breaker. Breaker.
It ain't ever been done before, hot shit.
Yeah, Bandit II, Que pasa?
Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
I tell you, engineering this kind of play against Sparazza, going to the lengths these guys are going to... they're playing some long odds.
But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one?
So he has no idea what's about to happen?
Maroon uniforms?
Mortal.
Did he give you his name?
You're sure?
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
And threw us into the lake.
No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry --
I left him a message.
Jesus Hugo! How is it that you can turn a simple conversation into a fucking hedge maze!? This is zero degree of difficulty man!
Okay.
That's probably him now...
-- Buddy, it's bigger than that, they want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie --
It's the last place they'd look.
...Are you insane?
...holy shit... that's Heller...  Isn't it?
I'll overlook what you've done here today in light of what's taken place. You've been fully debriefed. Now I want you to return to D.C. immediately and make no further inquiry into this matter. I mean it. It's closed.
No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.
Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this.
Right, you got clicks, anything?
You do the right thing. Sit with me while I heal, let it develop slow.
The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.
He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
What?
What do you want?
Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
No.  There's no behavior modification.
You fucking bastard...
How much sleep do you need?
Shut up.
An enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. We are in little danger of being left alone for long.  You'll need to do something. Otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you.
Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean?  I don't think so.
I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  Why now?
Human beings can die.
Get out --
What plan?
Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...
Into what?
I need to see Snow.
What are they?
Is it a planet?
You still don't believe in God?
I would have these -- I don't know how to describe them -- visions, when I was younger.  Maybe not visions, but like these waking dream states.  Time would just collapse, I would be inside time.  I would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped.  Freaky stuff.
Scared.  No, not scared.  Wary. Like I was something to be... her guard went up.  I was a threat.  Now I know why.  She was afraid she'd be seen.  That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. But that's the cycle, right?  I knew a little more than she did, she knew a little more than her mother, and on and on.  I guess that's part of the reason why --
You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
Sartorius.
I'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but I don't know who they are.
You... she said I didn't love her.
Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.
Rheya --
Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  You are her, you are Rheya.
Don't do this.  I am literally begging you not to do this.  Chris.
Neither did I.
Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?
Where did you go before?
They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual.
A recoil, with no compensating mechanism.
Followed by non-human manifestations.
I got rid of him.  I wanted to see if... I wanted to be the only one. I wanted to be Snow.
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
Can we go then?
What did he say?
Hey!  There are crazy people here.
I guess I'm supposed to do it in the morning.  Identify him.
Big talk... Desperate guy.
Claire?
Didn't do very well, did you?
You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?
Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
Good night, Mike.
I can't open it.
You don't wash your clothes at the Boulevard Laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this?  A fuckin' joke?
You told her?
Not exactly.
They guys treatin' you all right?
I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.
You still going away?
You're planning to speak?
Not if you don't want me to.
What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
For how long?
Don't start... The only reason is that the neighborhood's shi...  ... crummy.  I just don't like the idea of leaving you alone here at night.
I think television's a dangerous thing.
Hey.  The neighbors.
She's got to identify him.
Why?
She took you shopping for a tie?
Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
Did you hear what I said?
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
What did you watch?
Koontz!  I need you guys!
Are you in charge here?
You made a terrible mistake, Keegan. You didn't do what I said.
You should'a brought the girl.
Why should she come in?
Bullshit!  Prove it.
Let my kid go.
I know where everything is.
Nice threads Dad.
How about dinner tonight?
What!  What kind of pathetic line is that?
Shooting.
No…not really.
See?
Well, thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.
Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
Good morning, Liz.
But you like that in a man?
Does it have a human name?
Eugene.  Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like "Flash."
Don't misquote Othello at me. Besides, you'd have to care about somebody to strangle them.
I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?
--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
It's Friday night...
Poison emergency.
I heard about Thorkel's order--
Creation? Or its opposite?
The paper, my boy.  A solid B-plus.
Like it?
Imagine how I feel.
He'll try to finish his experiment.
Loonytunes.  And yet...
Up here, Docky Ocky!
I wouldn't talk about things like that.
Is you all little Adolfs?
There was that ammunition train in the depot at Frankfurt, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room and fixes a time bomb, see? Then he waits until the train starts moving out, see? And one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor, see? So he throws it, see, and three minutes later -- voom! See?
I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
They ought to be under the barbed wire soon.
Come on!
Nice guy! The Krauts shoot Manfredi and Johnson last night and today he's out trading with them.
I wouldn't worry about Schulz. I'd worry about Sefton. Remember me? I'm the stoolie.
Here's the knife to do it with. Only make sure you got the right throat.
Put me down for ten, you louse.
You killed them, huh? Both of them?
That's the general idea.  Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.
Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?
Ever try forty sleeping pills?
I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
You are being rude again.
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
Interesting.
Very well. If you insist on details. I have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb. Good day, sir.  You will forgive me for receiving you like this?
Good morning, Animal! What'll it be for breakfast? Scrambled eggs with little sausages? Bacon and eggs sunny- side up? Griddle cakes? A waffle?
I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
Hey -- Russki -- Russki! Look at those bublichkis! Over here!
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
Let me go!
Animal! When the war's over, remember I told you I'd fix you up with Betty Grable!
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
Easy, Animal! Easy!
That Schulz pig. I'll get him yet.
There, Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer?
Sergeant Hoffman from Barrack 4.
As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.
Anything else?
Not yet.
We've all done a poor job of it.
Los, los. Dummkopf!
You must get out. For your own good, you must get out.
You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
We did it.
Right.
Two packs of cigarettes say Dunbar never gets out of the compound.
You told them, Hoffy.
Give this to Joey, will you?
Or how about a game of pinochle? No, you're not a pinochle man. You're a chess player.  I haven't played since I was a kid. Let's see --  -- a pawn moves this way, doesn't it? And a bishop this way? And the queen -- every which way, doesn't it?
What did you say?
Say, Schulz -- you guys had machine gun practice last night?
No use, Schulz. You might as well come clean. Why don't you just tell 'em it's me. Because I'm really the illegitimate son of Hitler. And after the Germans win the war you'll make me the Gauleiter of Zinzinnati.
Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a fight?
What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
Population?
Is she still angry?
Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
What?
I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.
I have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters- attempting to level our descent.
You did it, Kirk!  Damage report, Ensign.
Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
Antonia?
Yes.  Thank you.
The first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death.  Scotty?
Aye.
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
Your family history is very important to you, isn't it?
The thought had crossed my mind.
I've spent eighty years looking for another way, Captain. This is the only one.  Of course, you could always come with me. You fancy yourself an explorer. Here's a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced.
We're all mortal, Soran. It's one of the truths of ou existence.
I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.
Calm yourself, Bones.
Admiral, there is no response from the Grissom on any channel.
Sir, the shields... Non- responsive.
Why don't we beam it up?
Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?
This is where the fun begins, Saavik!
New orbit commencing... Coming up on sector three...
Captain, please -- we'll take the risk. We've <u>got</u> to find out what it is...
Later. Let's go...
How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!
Why?
Did your collaborator know?
My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.
I'll go...
Ah, Saavik, that's, ah, extroadinary. What would you, ah, like to do next?
Captain, what's happening?!
I'm almost done, sir. You'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
Eight weeks, sir.  But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.
Sir...?
Mr. Scott: two photon torpedoes at the ready. Sight on the center of the mass.
Saavik... Is... David with you?
Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.
That distortion is closing rapidly... Opinion, Sulu?
What about surface life signs...?
Welcome aboard, Admiral.
Yours...?!
As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
You're right.  Thanks for the drink.
Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners.
No.
Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
I -- saw no future --
Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
Success, my lord.
Range: 3000 Kellicams.
Firing range, sir.
I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and...
He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
Go? <u>Where</u> are we going?
Until now.
Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...
Come on, Mother, that's just the military mentality. Never put off tomorrow what you can put off today. If there's one atom of life...
Go back. I'm going to kill him.
<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!
So am I. My friends were killed, too.
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
Khan, how do I know you'll keep your word?
I've never even met Admiral Kirk --
We'll be going to warp speed --
Give the word, Admiral.
Yes, Spock.
The <u>Kobayshi Maru</u> scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment.  As I recall you took the test three times yourself. Your final solution was, shall we say, unique?
The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?
It literally is Genesis...
... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond?
... the good of the few...
How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?
May I speak, sir?
Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
That was a little joke.
That's true, Admiral. All the memory cells have been emptied.
If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground.
Saavik, get us out, best speed!
Mr. Sulu... The shields!
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
Take her out, Mr. Saavik.
Spock... The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings. But as my son, you have them. They will surface.
To Earth. To offer testimony.
Heard there was some excitement.
Yeah.
And finally, they're not human beings, you know. Their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --
Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
Professor Scott, I'm Dr. Nichols, plant manager. I'm terribly sorry but there's been an awful mix-up Would you believe I was never told about your visit?
No!  No... What did you have in mind...?
I mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.
Are you sure?  That's what I thought.
Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..
That's crazy!
It doesn't look all that different.
What did you say she was getting?
There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
Guess, Spock. Your best guess.
You're saying... It is a compliment.
We're just -- observing.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.
Name?
They like you very much. But they are not the hell your whales.
You mean man...
A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type.
Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
Just lucky, I guess.
You're upset about losing the whales.
See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.
Hm?
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
Kirk. They're gone.
If we keep going up, they'll catch us!
Earth... But when?... Spock?
Well, Spock, thanks to your restored memory and a little bit of luck, we are in the streets of San Francisco looking for a pair of humpback whales.  How do you propose to solve this minor problem?
How do you know this...?
As you observed, a primitive Culture.
Yes.
Admiral, may I ask you a question?
Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?
And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.
What else did you learn from your mind meld?
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we <u>sink</u>.  Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?!  Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands.
Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours present speed.
Aye, sir. Descending.
10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.
Communications Systems ready. Communications Officer -- ready as she'll ever be.
I can't believe we've come this far only to be stopped by this!  Scotty, is there any way dilithium can be re-crystallized?
Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
I will. Can my assistant come, too?
Doctor Nichols, I might have something to offer <u>you</u>.
Hello? Computer...?
Oh, here and there.  I flew something similar in my Academy days.
Father...?
They are my friends.
Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?  
Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.
Deceive us?
Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well.  I don't intend to let them.
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
Will it?
Right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin... we can hide for days...
But I have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming. I plan on using them.
You're what?
Tournel will take you the rest of the way...
Data doesn't breathe.
Very funny...
A ship,
How many?
Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force.
What kind of concerns?
You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
You're not finished here?
I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs.
Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology.
A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me.
The countdown control has been transferred to the collector...I can't override...
They... are in opposite directions, sir...
I took these out of Data's neural net... they contain memory engrams...
All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...
Full impulse.
If we don't outrun them, the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship.
Deck five.
Prepare the ship for departure at oh-seven-hundred hours.
There's a short letter I left you all, just some... sentimental nonsense... the computer will bring it to your attention at oh- four-hundred... I'd just as soon you delete it...
We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
Sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force him to reset his shield harmonics. When he does, we could beam him out...
The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!
Should I distribute phasers to the Ba'ku, sir...?
Wine, women and song.
Augh?
Initiate launch sequence.
They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
Good hunting. Hayes out.
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
You actually performed surgery...?
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
Vulcan?
Dispersive armor is holding.
But now... they are all one with the Borg.
Who are you?
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
Data... are you sure you're all right?
Where's the battery room for the hospital?
What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?
Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.
"Money." So you can get dome money...
I can try.
Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.
It can't wait until tomorrow...
Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.
Lie. That's one. Keep going.
No. It's a lot further than that.
This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
Signal the Endeavor to fall back. We'll cover them.
Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister La Forge and a security team meet me in Transporter Room Three. Civilian clothes.
Life signs?
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
Are you alright?
Right.
We've lost Bridge control!
They're bypassing Engineering...
I'd prefer not to be the President to push the button if I can avoid it.
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.
You may need assistance, doctor...
Spock, that was actually funny.
That was the general idea I intended to convey.
I didn't mean this future.
That cunning little Vulcan...
ABSOLUTELY NOT!
Retire.
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
You were incompetent! - whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.
I don't believe we can get more out of the way than this.
My God, what happened here?
WHAT HAPPENED?
Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
I am.
As Captain I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
Torpedo room--?
But if she's cloaked...
Mr. Chekov, slow down. Take us forward, thrusters only, one quarter impulse power.
An INCIDENT?
Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth.
Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
What took you so long?
Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?
Maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed...
As you were. Lieutenant...?
Captain, our shields -- !
The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace -
Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
Why would they give them to us?
Someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter "S." You haven't outlived your usefulness - to me. And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -
I SHOULD have been -
Captain, perhaps we're going about this the wrong way; our job is to get to the conference; HER job will be to stop us.
Channel open, Captain.
WE SURRENDER.
Gorkon's own man??
You must have faith.
Very well. For twenty-four hours we'll agree that this conversation did not take place.
According to this we've completed our exploration of the entire sector.
- could take weeks, sir.
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
Beverly, come in.
Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.
As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.
Sir.  I noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding. I am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse, laughter through tears, but I could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously.
And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?
Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander. He fought seventeen major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that, we know nothing.
Good work. The download?
A weapon.
Yes, sir.
They are trying to override the access codes. Reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and...
I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual.
He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.
We are passing through the Bassen Rift. The projections will return when we have cleared it.
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
Negative.
You have a red shirt.
I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.
An individual more like you, you mean.
Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.
Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.
Admiral Janeway. Good to see you.
New Praetor?
Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
Won’t do what, Mister Worf?
Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear...  Naked.
To find the head, sir?
Thank you, sir...
Captain, I hope I don't have to remind you --
Counselor Troi, report to the bridge.
I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
Yes.
You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
You don't trust me.
Were we always explorers?
All of this so you could capture me?
Oh, but it does.  We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest.
We are.
I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.
This is a mistake.
No -- this is wasting time.
How long until we reach the Rift?
Praetor...
But surely...
You must learn patience, Commander. Do you know where I learned it? In the dilithium mines of Remus. Spend eighteen hours every day under the ash of a Romulan guard’s whip and you'll soon understand patience.
I don't see anything.
I make maps.
No.
Where did you stop last?
What was your last stop?
It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
Then it's not an accident that they found us.
Clarify that.
I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
I don't like it, George...
What?
Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again?
Steering wheel...
What?!
It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.
From?
My... husband.
Shit?
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
Shit... shit... what shit?
Sun...
How many days and nights do you have to go...  ...here?
Why?
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
The driver will...
Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.
The car will stop?
Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on.  Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it.
Jennyhaydn.
Goodbye.
What happened?
I don't understand 'friend.'
Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
What are you doing?
On the radio they say it's good.
The machine gave me two. Should I put one back?
You promised.
I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
Do they talk?!
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.
I understand.
What will you say about us?
Tell the baby about me.
You sure this is your car?
My grandmother's rich.
Save us all a lot of trouble.
People have made mistakes in these situations before.
It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
I don't understand.
I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
You know that's impossible!
I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.
That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
Hello...
If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
I saw you play, man.  You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying.  So what happened, injuries or what?
Bullshit politics.
Hey, fuck you, man.
Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news.  An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?
The only time a whore should open her mouth is when she's giving head.
This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby.  Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran?  You pinhead.
I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
Faith, call me, okay?
I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
Can't do it.
Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.
Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.
You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor! Double shots.  Make it Tres Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie.
That's not sayin' much.
Naw.  She won't call me.
Let's work it.
And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again.
So've I.  Too much.
That's right.  He wants to share. Needs an audience.  This is one sick puppy.
How did you hook up with Faith?
Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.
You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
Commissioner Strickland.
Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James.  I'll take you there, you can get a cab.
What's his name?
She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this.
Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.
Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.
Have you had a chance to think about --
Agent Duncan, there's an interstate issue up on 54, run out there.
This isn't in our database?
Hey, Sheriff.
Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report, yes, here.  These burn marks.
About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
He was sitting here?
What about his killer?
Maybe cause he's smart.
Another what?
Mackelway, I could understand. He is over-emotional by nature, but you, Agent Kulok, you had a shining career in front of you.
Look, sorry. Don't say a word.  I know this is improper. I've been trying to speak with Deputy Director Koessler. I left a message. I must speak with you before you go back to Washington.
Who?
An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
He's got you believing in Zero now too.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say.
This is a sexy case.
Relax.  J. Edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge.
Don't even go there. What's up?
"Gone live?"
I was interested in two things: computers and crime. They sort of came together.
I ever get like that, just take me out in back and shoot me.
It's a no-no.
You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable.
And nobody else can do that?
That's my point. Remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around.
My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago.
Start killing people for real?
I guess I'm a little paranoid.
You were right. He found me.
It's okay to be wrong, just don't be dead wrong.
That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low.
Who told you about her?
You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.
Lead the way, Murman.
George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
[What does the file say?]
Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
"Attitude Adjustment Issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  Why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket.
Headed there now. The same shift will be on at noon.
Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the "item" screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick.
Ever since I've known you.
Don't do it, Mike.
You like laughing at the misery of others?
Well, you know, it's tough. A lot of traveling. A lot of hotels... but, you know, it's a dream... and the money's really good. I think I might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in Vegas...
Are you sure? Maybe...
Well, I left someone very special behind.
Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that?
No, man. I know you didn't get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me. It wasn't that funny anyway...
Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?
No... no... The worst was when I went in for this After-School special and I'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids. I see they're all signed in for the same role as me...
Always...
Oh my God.
Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.
You're a comedian?
Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
Hello?
Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
No problem.
Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
It's unbelievable.
I'm going in. Will you be my wing- man?
Uuuuugh!
I'm such an asshole.
Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it...
I'm so sorry, man. You were so right. I got rid of the gun
What are they doing here?
Mike?
Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
We're going to Vegas.
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
I took out three hundred, but I'm only gonna bet with one. I figure if we buy a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then we trade back the chips at the end of the night. You gotta be cool though.
This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
They're all skanks.
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby.
I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
Mikey's the big winner.
I know. I know.
I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect...
Baby, you did fine.
Oh... a Dorothy.
Oh... "I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad..." Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother.
No! Not the camera guy!
I gotta use the phone.
She was hot.
She thought you were money.
I just need some time...
What?!?
I hear she's getting real fat.
No. Doesn't that suck?
What time's this party tonight?
Which one?
I'm sorry.
Please, don't mess with me right now...
You're not just, like, fucking with me?
It's not like that...
Is she looking now?
That was pretty cold, dude.
Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail...
...and big fuckin' teeth...
...You're just poking at it...
Now go over there and get those digits.
You're money.
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
Beautiful. What time are you off...  ...Christy?
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
An eye for an eye!
You look terrif on the floor!
I'll think about it.
You think we'll go for that last place?
Are you worried about security for your million?
Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States.  He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.
This morning.
No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson.
I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
Yes.
I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.
Your wife and children...you're happy with them?
Where are you going?
I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old.
What is it?
Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies?
Hello Kay.  Your father's inside, doing some business.  He's been asking for you.
Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man.  What could be more important than that.
Mike, why am I out?
No.  His name is Luca Brasi.  You wouldn't like him.
I told you you wouldn't like him.
Sure.
What will your father say?
Michael, what are you doing?
Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here.
Please say it.
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
Can I go to the hospital with you?
When will I see you again?
You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
Cut it out.
We can't wait.  No matter what Sollozzo say about a deal, he's figuring out how to kill Pop.  You have to get Sollozzo now.
You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
Do you recognize my voice?
How do you do.
Fausto and I -- we took the boat out, we were fishing, and then it was dawn and we'd caught absolutely nothing.
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back?
I'm never going back!
Sure. I love Venice.
A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
No! I've got more than one shirt!
Freddie?
I'm prepared to take the blame.
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
Oh God, I don't think so.
Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.
Yes it is.
No, Marge doesn't know the half of it.
You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.
We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
Such as?
Is Mr Greenleaf here?
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
I never said that!
I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.
He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home.  I'm going to go home.
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
I was looking forward to seeing him.
That's a terrific idea.
Look at me what?
I told you. He gave them to me.
That's why Tom wanted you to stay. It's better than squeezing into my room, and I know how you hate hotels.
What's funny?
As in the...?
How did you know that?
Show me the other one again.  I like them both.
Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.
Will you meet me tomorrow? Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too... you should always save pain for daylight...
Of course. Aunt Joan.
You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.
Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?
Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?
What did he say?
He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?
It's okay.
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though. Come back.  You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person.
How was it?
Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
Even your fiancée...?
Does he stay with you here?
I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up.  Tomorrow then?
I don't know...
Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.
It keeps ya busy.
So you haven't heard this record yet?
Where are you going?
My God!
You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.
But... Betsy...
I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.
Well, if Cronkite's so great, why don't we run him instead?
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it,
For a fee.
I don't like my real name.
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
I musta been stoned.
Do you understand why I came here?
What's so important?
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
You're not much with girls, are you?
What do you mean?
No.
I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much.
There must be something...
I know what you mean, Travis, and it's not going to be easy. We're going to have to make some radical changes.
Why?
Is that so?
I'm no cop.
How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport?
Wha -- ?
Travis.
What's the action around?
Look, ah, we never talked much, you and me...
Shoot. They don't call me the Wizard for nothing.
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.
Spit it out.
It's me sir.
Wrong.
What, vou?
Mason, uhm, John, I have something to tell you.  You know that pardon= contract you signed?
Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.
The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
You'll stand by me?
Then why do I feel like we're still being shadowed?
Whoa.
We were in love... weren't we?
What was that?
Were we going to get married?
No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...
I don't smoke?
No, they're not.  I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
Your dancing's very good.
It never used to be.  You were two left feet on the dance floor.  Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step.
I see...
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around.  I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him.  That's all.
Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?
You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?
"It's a Wonderful Life."
Or the Bijou.  Either one.
So... you do intend to fix the place up after all?
Harry, son.  Harry.
Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
Um... Harry?  Did I ever keep the books here?
No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
I'll be home in a little while, Harry.  Don't wait up.
You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.
Do you remember if you were driving a car?  Maybe you went over the bridge.  No guard rail there, it's easy to do.  It's happened before.
What's wrong?
Aren't you coming?
Can we get him to the hospital?
Jesus.
You think he's drunk somewhere?
What?  That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?
Leo, you're my agent.  Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I fought in the war, for crissakes!
And I won't be a communist anymore.
Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did.  You think they're gonna let me write pictures?  Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.
Tim, I have to tell you something.
It's a lovely garden.
You're leaving after you see Cathy?
It's a nice drive.  Is that where you met Mitch?
If you have some, I'd...
Thank you.
When was this?
Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
And the second?
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
Mother!
They haven't harmed anyone.
Darling, of course I do!
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
Lois!
Yes?
I see. How do I get down there?
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat?
Gulls!
I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.  I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...
If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
They're gone. The same pattern.
We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
They won't be.
What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
I lost my husband four years ago, you know.  It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.  I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep.  Do you think Cathy's all right?
I miss him.  You know, sometimes I wake up in the morning, and I think 'I have to make Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get up and there's a... a very good reason for getting out of bed until... until, of course, I remember.  I miss talking to him.  Cathy's a child, you know, and Mitch...  ...Mitch has his own life.  I'm glad he stayed here today. I feel safer with him here. 
Because my son is...  My son seems to be fond of you.  And I...  I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.
I think it might also matter to Mitch.
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
That's the last of it.
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once.
Lovebirds, sir?
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.
I don't know you.
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
To see a friend of mine.  Will you please be careful?
Why... 
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
He was watching a ball game on television.
What?
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
No.  At least, I didn't until I came up here.
Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?
I wrote the letter.
I told you what happened in Rome!
It is for me.
What do you want ?
I really shouldn't have any more. I'm a little tipsy already.
Cheers.
Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
Some cream?
The town looks clear.
How long have they been gathering there?
Have we still got power?
What time is it?
Mitch...
They said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon. If you'd care to come back...
They're both perching birds, of course, but of quite different species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. The blackbird is cyanocephalus.
I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but...
I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds...
Scotch, light on the water.
Birds?
The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
It's not because of Georgina -- because of Dr. MacFarlane's failure?
He's a great doctor -- a great man --
I'm cold as ice.
I don't think I can go on, sir.
Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl?
She came again today.  She wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate.  She feels you are her only hope.
You see, it is completely out of the question.
No.
They'll be thinking of that, too.
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
Where shall we put it? In the back?
He was a nice horse.
Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
Now that wasn't a friendly thing I heard, Toddy.  Not at all friendly.
What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
I am a doctor - a good doctor. I could make her walk, but she won't - she won't --
This is a gift you'll not return.
Have another glass of something good, Toddy.
"The ruffian dogs, the Hellish pair.  The villain Burke, the meager Hare --"
We could do that. But when he had them there, then what?
Any attacks of pain since?
Yes, Doctor.
Child seems to take to the lad. What sort of an accident was it, Ma'am?
But can anything be done for her?
I hate that picture.
Lauren's father's involved. He bought the cops fancy cars, I don't know what else. It's a company called D-E-L-T. I think Lauren found out.
Fuck! What do you want?
You killed her. I saw it.
Wrong. Answer.
I know her friends.
Your father gave them to both of you.
Daisy. How did you know?
It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
In the woods you said you had nothing. But you wouldn't, and I wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go. Please. At least not right away.
You want me to walk a straight line?
Sweetheart...
Please. Come inside.
Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?
Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure?
If you mean that you are afraid of us--
Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples.
Yes.
Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
Hi Mom!
Come on, Bobby. Time to go to bed.
Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?
Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
You're just kidding, aren't you?
I'll tell you, Bobby -- I've been away for a long time. Very far away.
Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out.
Just Klaatu.
We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.
Our problems are very complex, Mr. Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too harshly.
Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?
You still haven't answered my question.
The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow. If I could tell him I was getting married -- with two dependents--
You ready?
He's not there.  But look what I found in his room
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
You think it's all right for you to stay here?
I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond. I thought we might have lunch together.
That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
I don't know how to thank you.
Bobby's the only person I know who isn't -- Jittery.
Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?
I want to know what he told you last night.
I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.
This technique, in certain cases, can re-stimulate life for a limited period. It's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people.
They would have killed this man?
May I suggest that you call the Professor?
I don't like horror comics.
Think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us.
Can't stand light?
Should I run him through?
Maximum body-count.
Where's Star, David?!
Where you going?
With him?
Leave him alone.
And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's.
I have something to tell you guys.  Not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now I'm convinced my mother's <u>dating</u> one!
I told Max eight o'clock.
Laddie... you can <u>still</u> remember. You can still remember home.
It was a dream, Star.
I like Michael.
I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
Michael, will you do me a favor this evening?  Will you stay home with Sam tonight?  I'm meeting Max for dinner after work.
Sure.
I <u>didn't</u> invite you in this time!
Mom.  I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
In here?
Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
Nanook, stop breathin' on me.
Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a <u>mom</u>!
There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
You've got a generous nature.  I like that in a person.  My name is Max.
I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --
So, I've met the one woman on the planet who's going to hold my success against me.
Does it burn?
Michael invited me in.  Never invite a vampire into your house. It renders you powerless.
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
Me, too.
I wouldn't have given my Mom such a hard time about moving here if I'd known I was going to meet you.
Now you and David...
No.  They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
It's gone.  I feel it!
This room is mine.
Nowhere.
What would that make Mom?
Did you spill something?
No.  Why?
Wanna go to the comic book store?
Nanook...
What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you?
What??
Who are you calling?
Pretty nasty out, Mac.  Thirty-five knots.
Couldn't make much of it myself.
So what's our problem?
You can't let anybody leave!
Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
How you doin', old boy?
Watch Clark.
He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
Was dark... find a light...
Oh, shit!  Well, hang on!
What for?
Spaceship of some kind.
The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.
And if anyone tries to wake me...
Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
You reach anybody yet?
What if it doesn't come?
You crazy?  He might be inside already?
We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
What's happened?!
On the towers?
And everyone looks like us?
She didn't want me to be a climber. She wanted me to be a planner like her.
You have books?!  Kalen, you've got to take me there.  There might be history.  Records.  Something to help us find where the Morlocks took --
No one ever comes here.  My mother told me stories about it late at night.  They tell all the children.
Right up your alley, I would think. You are from the past, yes?
Sir... have you a name?
Because you'll never die.
Yes...
Yes.
What can I do?  Tell me what to do.
Nothing to do, I'm afraid.  I'm just a librarian after all.  Wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling.  Very Byronic end, though.  I appreciate that.  Do you know Byron?
I'll never forget this.
Alexander.
You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
I know.
Alex, what is it?
Alex... people are staring.
Let them.
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
I've been working.
It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.
Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...
That's absurd --
Good night, David.
Thank you...
Sir...?
I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey.
Don't then have stars where you come from?
The mud carriers.
Want to be a high climber now, do you?
It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.
Oh very.  Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time.  Night and day.
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
Yes... I suppose so.
Now that's more like it.  You look a proper gentlemen for once.
And roosters.
Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?
My fowl have polluted the yard.
You supported his application, Dr. Philby.  You are his senior, advisor.  I depend upon you to restrain his... excesses.  Any repetition of the behavior I witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both.
How did you get hurt?
I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week.
And you've no idea where he went?
[Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you...
My business?
Yes.
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
You died, Starks. Years ago, in the hospital.
I don't understand...
I thought you said you never knew your father.
What should they be looking for?
You look like you've lost some weight. Are you eating?
[Beat] What do you need me to do?
I can't take you out of here in your condition...
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
Jackie, go play in the snow.
I'm telling you I don't care what time you think you're in. You're not William Starks. [Beat] I don't believe in many things, but I believe in death. And it doesn't give back what it takes. So whoever you are...I did a nice thing, you've made me regret it enough already, so please, just leave.
But no one knew until after...
I might not be able to.
You're sure?
They're not.
Then why isn't there anyone around?
I think so.
[Beat] I don't know.
Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?
So maybe Dr. Becker would know. [Beat] But, as I'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.
Well, what time is it?
The future doesn't look different?
Because I don't have time.
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
How...how do you know?
You told me this was how it happened.
William, I can't indulge these delusions, even when you're in this state.
That's Kingsley. Old bastard hears us, I'm sure. He just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. I know. I tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. Literally. [Beat] You're the cop killer, right?
It's gonna be sticky.
'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now. When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me. Women!
In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?
Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.
What's this?
[Beat] Why?
I'm sorry.
Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.
Why?
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
Yeah, I could too.  But... I don't know why I'm even asking you this. It's just... we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie. I don't know.  I keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable.  If just one person would say...
Who's the nut?
Hal, I've told you about twenty times, yes, I could identify 'em, but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this.
If waitin' tables in a bar don't make you an expert on human nature, then nothin' will, and I could've told you that Harlan Puckett would end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot. I'm just surprised it didn't happen before now.
It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal.  I don't follow the customers to the parking lot.
I've been better.
We're both fine.
Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
That's certainly possible.
Now, for one thing, you violated your parole two days out.  And you know Judge Hainey.  He hates this sort of thing.  Once he gets wind of this, he's gonna blow sky high.  And then when he finds out that you're a possible accessory to murder and armed robbery, well, I think we can safely place your ass back in the slammer for at least the remaining eight, don't you?
Oh shit.
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
Louise, is that you?
That sounds nice.
You're a bank robber?
Tell me now.
What?
Who is it?
It's nothin' like that.
Am I in trouble?
We don't need the lantern.  The place has electricity.
In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.
It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
How come he let you go?
'Cause I didn't ask him.
Maybe.
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.
We're gonna go to the next town and stop.  We'll get a motel room.  I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money.  We're gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much money do you have with you?
I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood for company right now.  Here.  Take this map.  I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City.  I think we should stay off the interstates.  We're too conspicuous.
Thelma!  I'm not gonna talk about this!  Now find another way or give me the goddamn map and I will!  You understand?
Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
You think you've found your calling?
So what's the plan, Thelma?  You just gonna stay drunk?
Why not?!
Yeah.
I always wanted to travel.  I just never got the opportunity.
What?
Just the look on his face when you...  ... it's not funny.
Louise... are we still going to Mexico?
Eeuww.
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
What?
Hey, shit-for-brains, be careful not to scratch that thing, huh?
The thing's kind of heavy.
Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.
That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
I don't know.
Yeah, right.
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
Never met him.
Who?
Would you like a glass of tea or something?
Stalker, huh?
Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
What are you talking about? You were never an alky, you were a cokehead.
I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.
Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
Same here again.
Some buildings I'm working on.
Are you... an architect?
Well it's more of an enclosure really.
That sounds like fun.
I know he's around here someplace.
That grandmother of yours -- she's really something.
Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do love it.
I guess.
Uh-huh.
All you want is a phone number?
She's blackmailing you, right?
I've got some very, very good news for you, my friend.
Three different guys?
Have you been to  Let's see -- Santiago, Chile?
That stalkin' son-of-a-bitch!
Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.
No, it should be 'a hockey player with great pecs.'
It means you're too hard on guys.
Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
What's up?
You asshole, what are you --  Mary! Is that you?
You know what I'd like to see? Meat in a cone. You could put corned beef hash in a cone, or chopped liver.
It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
Ted...?
It.
OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
You're looking at him. C'mere and take a look at this beauty.
Now I've seen it all. What the hell were you thinking?
See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that this guy I like was gonna ask me.
Piggyback ride.
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
So if there are alternatives that make sense -- and I'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
There's still no sign they know that we know about the missiles. Been a lot of cloud cover; probably think we aren't getting any good product.
Well, I'm not.
He didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons.
Who gives a shit about the midterms now? The Soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us.
What happened to speak when spoken to?
All right, so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look. Okay? You happy? So now what?
So I understand you correctly. If the missiles in Cuba were dismantled, returned to the Soviet Union, and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them, the United States would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade Cuba?
We have high confidence in the expanded air strike option.  The problem, Mr. President, is that it's a short-term solution. Khruschev can send more missiles next month. The Chiefs and I believe we should follow up the air strikes with the full version of OPLAN 316.
Guess we can't blame Khruschev for a few patriotic farmers. And the ships?
I saw you out there. You want him to call you back, need you.
Busy. But you've got his heart.
I want an hour with him.
Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
Hey, sport. You winning?
I don't care. Cancel it.
How does a man get to a place where he can say, 'throw those lives away,' so easily?
What's that?
Jesus Christ, O'Donnell, you're the one saying we need to move forward on a political solution.
I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny?
At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.
Hey.
Mr. Clear Moon.
They're going to kill me next. That's what I hear. These new Indians are destroying everything. Our people are a quiet people.
What's this about?
Respect the dead, Hoss. Because when --
What the hell you doing?!
Jesus...
You crashed my file?
She took something from the house. What she called a medicine bundle. Most likely Jimmy's.
Let's see it.
Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
I'll sleep around a little.
All I could think of was... not here. I don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home.
Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
Tread matches. It's the car.
Jesus, you alright?
You didn't tell me about Red Deer Table --
Come on, Ray. Come forward.
No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
To us Indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family. I've got seven mothers on this reservation. Sisters. Brothers. You ain't one of them.
He knows me?
He said he doesn't know.
Why should I tell you.
Jimmy didn't do it, Ray. I checked it out. You can stop taggin' my sister.
It's not real.
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
What's that?
1868...
That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.
Ray. Ray, don't let go now, Man. Ray...
Who did?
What?
I read, Cooch.
Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down.
Good.
I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
The men who came to see you at Leavenworth. The one's who made the arrangement... who were they? Maybe I can talk to them.
What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English!
I saw one.
Well, what you need...what you have to keep looking for...what you want to get is a wingman who can stay up with you. Who can match you move for move. Then you've got something.  I'm sorry.
Apology acknowledged.
There you go with those moves again.
Yes. I'll give you that!
Let's make it at eight.
Why'd you do that?
That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.
What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about...  Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.
It's just as I thought.
Anything.
Lucky charm.
Just good luck.
Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
You look way out there. Out past the date line. West becomes East, all things change. You cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, I forget which.
That's what I want.
Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.
What do you do when you come here?
Strip reality! How do you play that?
What truth?
Well?
F-14's sir.
I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
I'm pulling up.
We're on vapor, Cougar, you got to put it down.
Okay, okay.
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!
Ohhh Mother!
The plane is fine.
Well what?
On what?
Did what?
Got you here.
I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
Ahhh...A little high on the left, don't you think?
Hi...Hi there. How ya doing in there?  Mav... Ahhh...you know, at one point I did want a Navy career.
Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support, man!
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
I was a victim of circumstance.
She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.
Mav's a great flyer but....
No, we...got our butts kicked.
COME OFF RIGHT--COME OFF HIGH--I'M IN--I'LL ENGAGE.
COME OFF--COME OFF RIGHT. I'M ON MY WAY IN. YOU GO FREE, I'M ENGAGING.
The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  We're gonna get them wet unless we find a Sonoco station.
Maverick... Where'd you get that call sign?
Why?
SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..
Well, there it is; the Last Resort.  Sure you wanna go in?
Shut up and drive!
How could you do this?  You're a mutant.
Never mind.  Wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  That'll muffle the signal.
Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker.
Don't take my word for it, Quaid. Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
I am Quaid.
But I thought...
Listen to me!  He's been going on and on about Mars.  He's really been there.
Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Renata, cover up any memory he has of us or Rekall.
I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy in there.
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
HER!
If we don't hand you over, everybody in the sector'll be dead by morning.
Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.
Shit!
Why not?
Harry!
Where?
Where is he?
How did I get in this taxi?!
Welcome to JohnnyCab.  Where can I...?
Mmmm.....
It's not funny, Doug.  You dream about her every night.
Lori...
Just think about it.
And you believe him?
Mars?  You've never even been to Mars.
--I got a trip to Mars.
The hell you're not.
Nooo!  I would never do anything to hurt you.  I want you to come back to me.
Come on, don't bullshit me.
No options.
Blondes.
I thought Cohaagen tortured you to death!
What are you talking about?
Hauser?  You're Hauser.
She wasn't really my wife.
We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars.  You asked me to find you if you disappeared.  So here I am, good-bye.
You stupid punk!  You came <u>that</u> close, <u>that</u> close!!
How much you think?
What the hell is that, anyway?
There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record...  That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  Right.
I might have an idea...
We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.
You know, up the jeep trail.
You're full of shit.
If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
Well, whatever the hell happened it's just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place.
Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
Fuck you!
I'm gonna kick his ass!
A car, huh?  Like a big armored car?  Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
Get real.  I'm faster than you.
<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat.
Civil?  I'm civil.
Somebody paying you to do this?
And I appreciate it.
Hi, I'm Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck. I'm up here for the semester...
Don't hurt him.
Objection.
Good morning, Mr. Dowd. Do you think you might be up to cross-examining Mr. Ortega this morning?
Hey -- the fact you popped Jimmy Chin in broad daylight proves it wasn't premeditated. Jury'll sympathize -- dude was banging your wife, right?
Haven't heard that one before, Ed.  But I guess I'll be hearing it again.
Kim's prints were all over it -- He admitted it was his gun, f'r godsake!
Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.
Right. You're right.
Don't tell me where to work. I moved to New York to work for Edward Dowd. But I can't believe that Edward Dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little --
Ten years is a long time.
That DD-5.
A fucking wheelchair?
Hey -- you believe what you want. Shu Kai Kim is innocent.
"The killer wasn't Chinese"... Cecil Stipe was right. .!
...Jesus!
How long did it take Badalato to drive Jimmy Chin's body from Chinatown to the morgue?
Stipe was just one of four eyewitnesses who came forward, Kitty. Y'oughta start looking for the others...
"...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"?
But why would a guy would do that? Paint black teardrops on his face?
...You told the Desk Sergeant you were certain Mr. Kim wasn't the killer?  You left your telephone number?
You won't remember this, but in '72 I was one of several prosecutors assigned to the Black Panther-Police Shootout.  We had a whole team, and you walked into court by yourself and kicked our collective butt.  So what've you been up to since then?
Now maybe you got this case reopened because you see yourself as a thorn in society's side, or you want to walk into any restaurant in Chinatown and get free dumplings...
Yes, but that's not the issue. What's on your wish list, Ed? Pleading Kim out to first degree man on both homicides, with an agreed sentence of 15 to life running concurrent? Come on... What're you looking for here?
I never joke about waiving a client's Sixth Amendment right to trial.
Isn't it a standard trick to pack a line-up with men who resemble each other but look different than the suspect, so the suspect will stand out for the eyewitnesses?
We just discovered him, your Honor! His appearance is critical to a fair presentation of our case! He is an inmate at Ossining Correctional and --
-- Can't Mr. Dowd find his own expert witness, your Honor?
Yes, Mr. Dowd.
I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
If a member of the Aryan Brothers tries to cut in on your distribution?
Shu's the only one I know of...
Cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads. Do you honestly think Cole's practice of word association works?
Blonde.
I'M NOT KIDDIN'. WHERE WERE YOU? WHO WERE YOU WITH?
Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
Babe, I'm on my way out to the woods to divvy up the product. Put this cash in your safety deposit box...  It's ten thousand dollars.
No shit...  We killed a guy for baby laxative.
What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
That's not the way to Cliff's trailer. I told you.
Is there a golf course around here?
Where am I? And how can I leave?
Where's Hap?
He's dead -- good and dead.
He didn't suffer.
Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it.
Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
Sort of shorthand.
Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
That's good.
There appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand.
Accidental?
Geez, Agent Desmond, it's three-thirty in the morning. Where are we going to sleep?
I think we should see the sun rise at the Canyon Trailer Park.
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?
Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond?  I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin?
No... hell, no. Just got in the truck, started drivin', looked down at the gauge and saw a big "E" starin' at me.
What'll it be?
What does Bob say?
No... No...
Did you make me a tape?
Baby, you know why? Cause it'll never get here.
I don't want to offend the customs of your country.
I understand.
Dad.
Neither is mine. And can't we talk about something serious for a change.
Soon. How about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about?
What are you doing?
Who am I?
If Leo comes here, he won't believe that I am out doing the "Meals on Wheels".
Mr. Abraham...
Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.
Four cases in three years...
So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
What are you doing here?
This is going to drive the ante up.
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
No.
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
You've just said you signed it.
Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today?
How is that?
Meth... Methodology and Technique...
Tell me one?
...we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
I completely understand...
It's all right, Mickey.
...I made a reservation at...
Dr. Thompson. From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.
Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
I'm afraid that's not true.  Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
The most respected...
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
Thank you.
Yes.
One hour.
Yessir. I'm sorry.
Why is that?
...things change.
Thank you for seeing me.
Sustained. Yes. The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
Overruled...
Laura.
We, we... No... we just had a small reversal in the case...  I have some, uh... I have some work to do...
Do you think it's my fault?
Isn't there something you...
You're pressuring yourself...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth. He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life. And we can prove that. What we don't know is why. What went on in there? In the O.R. That's what we'd like to know. Something went wrong. And you know what it was. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. What happened? The phone rang... someone got distracted... what?
You know, you're pushy, fella...
It's locked.
It's not a good case. It's a very good case.
...I understand...
Dr. Gruber.
...now who is that...?
They killed her. And they're trying to buy it...
You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...'
We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
Admittance form is wrong.
Right.
You got a good memory, Franky.
Been a long time, huh...?
What I'm saying, they're getting some help.
Okay. What do you do when you don't have a witness?
Uh... the admitting nurse...
What did she do?
She didn't do anything. She took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
Huh. And why is that?
Should I?
That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.  Jimmy, gimme another drink.  How are you?
We'd be in all the papers!
Did you see it come down?
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
You seem to know a lot about him.
Well, you certainly don't look like yourself in that get-up!  But I am happy to meet you anyway. I'm Sylvia Van Buren.  I teach Library Science over at USC.
How does it happen cars are running?
Don't you live at home?
No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
I've been as close to them as anyone. But not close enough for real observation...
He liked you ... I could bawl my head off!
This Martian blood...  Let's make a quick analysis and see what we've got!
That's their position?  You've certainly got them surrounded.  I suppose they've neutralized all communications here.
Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field phones are okay so far.
My orders are not to go into action unless they make a move out of there.
Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.
What'll we say to 'em?
So I don't know about horror.
Yes, but...
I don't know.  A couple months.  Why?
Heather?
Like what?
Time for sleep.
In my bed.
Seemed, not was.
Absolutely.  And how many times has Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again?  It gets under your skin if you let it.
John Saxon.  Do you have any idea what time it is?
I know how Chase really died.
Heather Langenkamp?
Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
No, I don't think that at all.  How is he?
If Freddy's loose, I mean, in your script, where's he going to go?  Another age?  Another form?
That was Nancy, not me!
The way to stop him is to make another movie.  And I swear to you I'll stay at my computer and keep writing until I finish the script.  But when that time comes...  You're gonna have to make a choice.
Now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?
Can I get you something to drink?
Sounds good.  Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee?  How you like it, Hon?
Guilty.
I haven't forgotten.
Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...
She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."
Yes, Sir.
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
Everyone out of the rigging NOW!
What the "Bowsprit Affair"?
I doctored my grades so I'd make the cut.  I'm a moron, okay?  You satisfied?!
I've been getting ninety-sixes my whole life.  It's what they expect. After all this, I still haven't figured it out.
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
Me either.
That's not why he's sending me.
Nobody says you have to be like me.
Listen man, I think I have a problem.
Honey, did you know that the Albatross was captured by the Germans during World War II?
What the hell is going on?
How ya doing?
Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
I can't go in there.
Remember something, sooner or later... we all have to face it.
Shouldn't we turn away?
Of what?
I mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is.  What right did then have to show up here?
Does Phil know how you guys feel?
Yes sir.
Spirits have a way of bringing that out.
And being sixteen.
That's enough.
How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
Me, too.
They tell you that?
Why, man?
What's that?
I have arranged to host a good will cruise for the Dutch students of the local school there.
Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier...
For killing a dolphin.
I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
The families... want your ticket. Turn it in, we forget the whole thing.  Everybody goes home.
... Absolutely not.
I can dig this music... But not that singer.
Meetin' him at the gate. That phone call this afternoon was the signal. My deranged mama's hid the keys to my car. But of course, I know exactly where they are.
This be it?
What's Cao Ben?
How old are you?
No way... GET OUT!!!
How 'bout a beer?
No... I don't think so, man.
That's right... Take one of these.
Nice of you to drop by.
Mostly black though in that boogie place.
What's the name of it?
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
No big buildings like in New Orleans.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's got an appliance shop.
Sailor... Lula loves you.
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance.
She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor.
Would you like to enjoy a martini with us?
Hasta siempre.
Now, Marietta, I am goin' to help you. And don't be gettin' carried away. You don't want to be bringin' Santos and his people into it.
No, but my guess is they're headed west, so prob'ly Texas. Their money must be runnin' low. I don't think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.
How'd she sound? Was she doin' okay?
I did, honey, but that was last night... Let's just find those two kids before it's too late.
Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
I'll pack my things and meet you downstairs.
You won't of missed much.
Like you, sweetheart. You and your daddy got the same mouth, eyes, ears, and nose. Only difference is your color hair is like mine.
Hey baby...
You remind me of my daddy, you know? Mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies. He had a long nose, too, like theirs. Did I ever tell you how he died?
I said you can be too crude sometimes? I don't think I care for it.
You okay, honey?
Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Yeah?
At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know? Gettin' out? And what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again.
One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin' one big cockroach on his anus?
The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over a thousand dollars? Then a little while later Dell ran off a third time to some place he said would "give him peace of mind." Nobody's seen him since.
Sailor!
You up for that?
She just rolled over onto her stomach and stuck her ass up in the air. I slid my hand between her legs and she closed her thighs on it.
That don't smell like a More.
It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.
You ain't gonna begin worryin' about what's bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin' state lines with a A-Number One certified murderer.
Life is a bitch and then you marry one.
There ain't no water in the swimmin' pool. Just a dead tree fell in, prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'.
We're about dry bones, sweetheart. We don't wanna have to push this "bird" into New Orleans.
Huh?
Too bad they don't give an award for talkin'... You'd win first prize. Especially with those tits.
What was this one?
Let's get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. Feelin' all that voodoo...
Oh my God... It's Johnnie... Duck down!... Get goin'!
Yeah.
What's wrong, sweetheart? Somethin' botherin' you?
Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
That's some big secret you been carryin', Sailor.
It's a comfortin' idea.
There's worse places, honey.
Trust me on it.
What's that?
Well, it ain't exactly Emerald City...
Not bad for eleven dollars a day.
You sick?
Sailor? You know what?
Oughta make 'em happy.
I'm sorry, Sailor. I just can't help it. Give me a minute and I'll quit.
What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.
...live in exchange for sexual favors. Police said they have identified and questioned at least four girls, all Asians twelve to fifteen years old, who have been living in the North Houston warehouse with a Vietnamese pimp since February. The girls are being treated as victims, said police Sergeant Amos Milburn. 'These are really just children,' he said, 'but they've been exposed to a lot already.
Really, Lula, this ain't right!
Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans? Lula, are you in New Orleans?
No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!
Lula? I love you, baby. I just want you to be all right.
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
Wouldn't make any difference.
I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.
Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
No...
Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile.
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
No... I just wanted to kiss you good- bye... You know too much 'bout little Lula's mom...
You really are one dumb asshole.
Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it...
Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
I just mean...
I'm sure. Where is everyone?
I know. He started it Fall semester.
And he had a younger brother who... was... a...
Wait here. I'll be right back.
Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?
I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
So what's the problem?
The Chancellor's here? Now?
Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general.
Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady.
Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought... I thought I'd come out here and take a look at it. You don't see one of those every day. It looks like heaven...
Shit, James. You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog.
Yea, James.
Whose tuba is that anyway?
Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the auditorium.
Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
How's that?
Colon cancer.
It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a small town.
It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years.
Your father worked in a mannequin factory?
I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy?
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
What would you call them then?
It's because you don't eat.
Yes, Hannah?
I thank you.
Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
Jesus.
I got the message you called.
I need to talk to you.
Is the thing -- is it over?
I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.
You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady?
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
I told Walter.
Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing?
Listen, Antonia --
It's Grady, Walter.
Grady?
I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is?
Oh?
No.
Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up.
What made you pull out that old thing?
And?
We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over.
One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you?
Mr. Crabtree was saying how George Sanders killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.
There's so many...
Yeah, you still with Northland?
But maybe it's not so healthy being so close, you know, to a school.
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
She's got all this new furniture now. She said it didn't fit anymore, so I kept it in the attic. I thought you might like it.
No thanks.
What's that?
Aren't you glad?
When?
I'm not a monster.
You always carry these?
Their sound is quite musical.
Try.
Not at first. You would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and fly.
See anything interesting?
A pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends.
I would.
Doesn't everybody?
You can't talk to me like --
Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships.
Don't be witty.  Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter?
You knew her?
Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.
No you're not.
Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.
They sound like finches.
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
Walter?
The job's okay.
You seem a little hostile today.
Ev-i-dence.
Reflect.
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
I mean, when will I be normal.
They usually tell me.
When did it all start?
Close your eyes.
I'd like you to close your eyes.
To relax.
Where?
Walter, what did you do while taking a nap with your sister?
I'm only asking questions.
I'm talking about you.
You never spoke to me before.
They could eat you.
What was prison like?
No. That's what I used to tell myself.
Nothing. It's over.
Which brother did this?
What?
Neither am I.
Live together.
Don't do that.
What's your fucking problem?
You okay?
I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
My rig.  I designed the damn thing.
I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh.
Fine.  Be that way.
But what did he see that made him panic?
Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker.
If you say so.  It could be anything.
They must've learned how to control water... I mean at a molecular level.  They can plasticize it, polymerize it... whatever.  Put it under intelligent control.
It's flooding like a son of the bitch.
Good hundred yards, I'd say.
Alright, put this on.
What's the plan?
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
We'll go in through that large breach.
Virgil?
Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
What's the matter with you?
Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen... de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc syringe... and some... heating blankets. You got all that?
Got it. Over.
'Fish'?
Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.
You better not say you missed that.
Copy that, continuing forward.  You just want me to get shots of everything, right?
Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on final approach.
Figured that out for yourself, did you?
Uh, oh...
He's losing it.  Talk to him.  Keep him with us.
When do you have to go back?
And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?
Isn't it fashionable any more to put on a sailor's cap with the name of the yacht?
I presume by this method that you'll be able to uncover some new clue, either a handkerchief or an article of clothing... In other words, something which your men have not been able to find as yet.
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...
Say, Claudia, wouldn't you like to climb up with me and take a look over there?
How should I be ... arrogant?
Yes, you should go.
Let's get out of here, fast... This is not a town, it's a cemetery.
Are you joking?
Really, I've got to stop this business with Ettore... I would like to go back and start working on my own projects again. You know, I had many ideas...
Then I'll see you later.
Sandro ...What's the matter?
Well, with a shark running loose around the place, I for one won't get aboard that raft! They'll have to catch it first. I want to see it right here before my feet, dead or alive.
Tell me, Claudia, what do you think of Raimondo?
Have you ever been in love?
I'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands.
You say that just to flatter me.
I'm not coming.
Shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?
I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.
But for what reason should I come there?
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
But how can you carry on a discussion in this heat?
It's really a fact -- there's nothing new under the sun. Now, look here. Look at this structure... a kind of natural shelter. Sandro, that's how you should design your houses.
Up until now those smugglers were operating only around the Palermo area. This will be a nice surprise for the Lieutenant in Milazzo... Call up headquarters. Bring them up to date and have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate.
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
What is it?
Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
But how could they pose like that? I couldn't.
They tell me you have a lot of trouble at home. Is that right?
Yes, sir. Three times.
Don't worry, we've got everything.
Whose boat is that?
At this time of the year there are so many boats...
And here's Sandro.  Why don't you two go upstairs and change?
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
Zuria?
You're kidding!
Oh... I'm sorry I have to rush but I've got to write a story about this thing that just happened... Tell me exactly how it all turned out.
As a matter of fact, I've already had several phone calls on that article. One said they had seen the missing girl in an automobile somewhere in Rome. Another one said they saw her on the pier talking with some strange sailors... Could be she secretly left the island by boat...
Why?
She'd punish me.
I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven.
Oh my dear child.
No.
No I don't.
What would you like to talk about.
Anything... may I sit down?
Who?
Why should they?
I don't know.
How were you sick?
Where?
And what happened?
From God.
Martha Louise Livingston.
Would you like some?
No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
What happens if the bell rings and you're under there?
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
Sometimes, yes.
I can't.
She's dead isn't she?
Yes.
It came out of me.
Yes.
I can't tell you that.
Yes.
What do you do?
Why isn't anyone coming?
Alright Agnes... it's alright. One, two three...  It's alright... it's me, Doctor Livingston, it's alright, alright. Thankyou Agnes, thankyou. How do you feel?
Frightened.
Agnes, can you hear me?
Yes.
Yes.
God!  It was God.  And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him.
What did you do?
I put her to sleep.
No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit.
The bishop is breathing down our necks.
???
Hello, Mama  ... brought you something.
It's your favourite...
It's Martha, Mama.  There you go.
Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.
Why do you think that?
Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination.
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
No... not in the eyes of the police.
No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
She molested her!
An unhappy woman...
Do you want to become one?
Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?
A miracle is an event without an explanation. If she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her womb?
There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.
She is an innocent.
Did you know she was pregnant?
The baby?
You went to the room to help with the birth.
Oh, don't do this!
Of course, John.
Well --
Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
You don't think...
He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little.
You never know, you might be lucky this time.
We want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers.
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
Get him out of here!!
It is, y'know.
How'd you like a dirty great drum roll giving you a clout right in the middle of your solo?
It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.
Are you supposed to be here?
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
Is it ... is it, really?
Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?
Oh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you?
Oh aye, a sledge.
What are you?
Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!
You can learn from books.
Parading's better!
Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
Lip reading.
Hello.
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
Yeah ... so what?
Why do you always use your left hand?
With a trombone hooter like yours it'd be unnatural if you didn't.
Oh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke.
Anything to spare?
Clean though, isn't he?
That little old man.
Y'what?
You've got a midnight matinee.
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
Hello.
Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...
Well, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.
I knew it, <U>he</U> started it, I should have known.
Stop picking on him.
Do I have to raise me voice?
Nerves.
... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like.
Course he can talk. He's a human being, like. Isn't he?
Oh, he's gone to my club, has he?
I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
Dell, what's the last thing you can remember?
Where's Irth?
Except it will take 75 years to get a reply back.  Don't forget how far we are from the Colonies, Martin.
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.
Looks like a derelict.
Can we come up?
Wretched.  What happened to me?
Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back!
Hard to say.
Well, get started.
<u>He</u> died.
What?
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
It grows on you.
What happened to the lights?
Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are clogged with dust.  We overheated and burned out a whole cell.
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
Might even incinerate the damn thing.
It's clear.
All right... but do <u>not</u> go below decks.
That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?
Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it -- it might jump on us --
Still unconscious?
I don't buy that.  There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers.
It will be.
Why, you chickenshit bastard --
Well... I suppose that star-shaped thing could be the parasite that got on Broussard.  Is that what you mean?
First contact...
Doesn't seem much doubt about it, does there?
What'd he say?
No, it's coming.
It won't come -- it's stuck.
Time and space have no meaning out here.  We're living in Einsteinian equation.
We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We even have our own special diseases.
I've got Hunter... and something else as well, in front of him.
Men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe.  This is an opportunity which may never come again.
Source of transmission is to the northeast... about 300 meters.
These day and night cycles are totally disorienting.  I feel like we've been here for days, but it's only been how long?
Zero.  Dry as a bone.
Okay, Chaz, I hear you.  I've got you on my board.
Martin?
Find anything we missed?
Here, Chaz.
You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
I think the best thing to do with Broussard is to just freeze him as he is.  It'll arrest the progress of his disease, and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the Colonies.
It started crashing around right after we locked it in.
I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door.  His body held it open.
At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
Let's hear it.
You know, it's funny -- this stuff we went to so much trouble to dig up -- this treasure, the paydirt -- it'll make it back to Irth just fine -- even if we're not with it.
It's a rhino.
Is it dead?
Yeah, it's fine.
God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.
Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?
Give or take.
Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.
Has anybody talked to them?
Deal.
Something spooking the rhinos?
I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.
C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus.
Oh, man.  That's no glitch!
What happened?
Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too.  That's also on the display.
Hey, Jan.  See if you can get someone to check out the chopper.
What's the problem?
Communications to auto-shop go through an F.O. link off the main trunk. That's down with the other feeds.
Uh-huh.  Used to get it pretty bad.  I'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.
How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
Only six?
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.
Ah, don't worry about I.C.C.  They're the least of your problems right now.
So, what do you think?
You should hit the sack, too.
Give me a yell is something happens.
I don't think that's funny.
Also with the reluctant compliments of Max Fabian.
Some plain soda.  Lloyd must be expecting a record run in New Haven...
Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-
What do you take me for?
I never intended you to be.
I still don't know what you're getting at. Right now I want to take my nap. It's important that I-
What have you got to do with it?
Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.
I can't believe my ears...
A dull cliche.
That's not true!
You can have one at Max's.
Because I don't want to.
This must be, at long last, our formal introduction. Until now we have met only in passing...
Feeling better, my dear?
Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?
Answer me this. What makes a man become a producer?
Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?
Eve, this is an old friend of Mr. deWitt's mother - Miss Caswell, Miss Harrington...  Addison, I've been wanting you to meet Eve for the longest time-
I take it she read well.
Good luck, genius...
When? When are you going to do it?
Bill...
When - when are you coming back?
I love you...
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
- guilty.
I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes you frighten me.
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
Don't calm down.
Paranoiac!
It's obvious you're not a woman.
Don't be condescending.
It's not nonsense.
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.
Yes, dear.
A cowboy.
Often enough to keep the franchise.
Why what?
I'll admit I was worried when Max called. I had my doubts.
I'm talking about you. And what you want.
When I told you what every young actress should know.
Find out.
The same size?
How do you do, my dear.
You bought the new girdles a size smaller. I can feel it.
There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency?
I might.
She's got to meet you-
You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?
I thought you'd forgotten about me.
You're not going, are you?
Discouraging, isn't it? Women with furs like that where it never gets cold...
Do you think Miss Channing would approve?
I think she would cheer.
You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...
Karen...  ... you won't forget, will you? What we talked about before?
May I have your coat?
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
- an understudy's performance.
He can help you.
You want to play "Cora." You want me to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.
It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.
No, thank you.  Yes. I've seen every performance.
It's been a real pleasure, Eve.
Well, teacher's away and actors will be actors...
During your second act scene with your father, Roger Ferraday's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch. He's been coming closer down every night...
You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...
Well, you've done so much... what's new?
The curtains. I made them myself.
Very becoming. It looks better on you than it did on me.
I've got it.
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
Well, I was sure you'd want to, of course, being his birthday, and you've been so busy these past few days, and last night I meant to tell you before you went out with the Richards - and I guess I was asleep when you got home...
I'd like to hear it.
The hors d'oeuvres are here. Is there anything else I can do?
Why not?
Hi.  Hello, darling-
I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.
Do you want it on?
More than anything in this world, I love Bill. And I want Bill. I want him to want me. But me. Not Margo Channing. And if I can't tell they apart - how can he?
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
How was the concert?
I guess I didn't look. You know I don't pay attention to those things...
That was a pity...
Now just a minute!
On her knees, I have no doubt! Very touching, very Academy-of-Dramatic Arts!
Who is it? What's it all about?
Have you forgotten about Eve? What she is, what she's done?
I thought you knew... She was put on over a week ago-
You'd have been proud of her.
I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
Usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater!
I have no intention of having an accident!
That's right, but I don't understand-
I just played it.
Play it again.
Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.
Well, if she can act, she might not be bad. She looks like she might burn down a plantation...
Would you?
I promise.
--it was fine the way it was--
--fifteen phone calls--
Were you eyebrow reading?
I hate both parties.
--I haven't said anything--
How high up, which Republicans?
Nah.  Maybe.
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
It's nothing personal, though. 
--Jesus--
Woodward?
Hmm?
John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that--
--Howard Hunt?
Harry, I just talked to a Miami investigator about Barker--
--no--
--there's nothing new in it--
--Bernstein, are you sure on this story?
Absolutely--
Lot of pressure at the Star.  Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this.  How much did the damn bike cost?
There's always a later plane.
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere.  ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it.
My big civil rights buddy--  --boy, if John Mitchell was after your phone records, would you be screaming.  What're you onto?
Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
To cover up?
I will not talk about the other two.
--this'll only take one second--
Same kind of crap--
What's this?
Go on.
It will, it just hasn't bottomed out yet, give it time.
Look--why would the Republicans do it? --my God, McGovern is self- destructing before our eyes--just like Muskie did, Humphrey, the bunch of 'em.  Why would the burglars have put the tape around the door instead of up and down unless they wanted to get caught? Why did they take a walkie- talkie and then turn it off, unless they wanted to get caught? Why would they use McCord--the only direct contact to the Republicans?
I was told by this guy at the White House that Hunt was investigating Teddy Kennedy.
--his dialing finger must be falling off--
Anything else from Mr. Throat?
Douglas Caddy, the attorney of record, when questioned about his presence in the courtroom, denied he was in the courtroom, "I'm not here," Mr. Caddy said.
Mr. Rafferty was very helpful. Four Cuban-Americans and this other man, James McCord.
I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.
It was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once.
--this should take only a minute, Mr. Dahlberg, but we're doing a follow- up on the break-in--  --and I was kind of curious about your check.
If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
Ratfucking.
Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?
James McCord.
You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?"  I woke up again last night with that same question.  Are we right on this story?
No.
It is.
What'd you get on W.House?
Who's Charles Colson?
Anything?
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
You're a killer, Ozzy!
Great evening, isn't it?
I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
This is your plan, Finch?
What are we gonna hear?
Forget it.
What?!
You talked to Stifler?
Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
I'll give you a hint.  "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  Comprende?
Do you?
No comment.
Thanks.  It was my idea.
Unlisted age, plus "youthful mind," equals old.
What about you?  You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base.
Hey, where's Finch?
Went home to shit.
Did I miss anything?!
Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.
Yeah, sure.
Dad!  I know!
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
Yes.  Seriously.
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
This'll do.
Illegal channels?  Shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is. Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some shit.
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
Is there anything you don't jerk off to?
Shortstop.  'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.
It's true.  I mean, after this, everything'll be different.
You've got something going?
No...you...go...ahead.
Did you see this?  This is your more exotic dirty magazine.
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
Kevin, this is serious!
Let me know.
I was being selfish.  And majorly insensitive.  And I'm a total idiot.
Oh...ungghhhhh!
You're not doing the extra credit problems.
We've come a long way since Homecoming.
You want to do it?
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
Just dial 976-Asshole.
Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible?
Contact, dude.
What reputation?
Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude?
Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm working on something new.
Keep it down, dude.
Here, babe.
I don't know if I want to be doing this.
I'd use pills. They're painless.
Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha.  I think maybe I drank too much.
What?
You were. I have work to do. The publisher wants the transcripts by Monday. Go. Make yourself at home.
Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
I'm serious. There's nothing for you down there. It's dangerous.
So you came after all. Just in time, it's getting interesting.
Thank God! What a relief! I thought... After you disappeared... I couldn't find you... I thought all sorts of horrible things...
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
What about your glasses?
Hello?
Because, Andy. It's a cure.
I don't know...
What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
These tunnels must loop around and connect.
Don't be an idiot! I'm not the only one. If I die, Serafine dies!
Claude...?
Ha. Some wonder drug...
Oh shit... No...
Yeah?
You didn't know? But then why did you... well, don't worry. It's relatively mild.
Uncle Terrence.
The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?
Where is it! Please!
I'm afraid she's not so lucky. She's undead. And so am I.
Alright. Let me write a letter.
Now!
You better follow that McDermott kid. He's going to wind up like his uncle if he's not careful.
Saint Severin...
I was showing Sonya something . . .
Are you running away?
I shant!
Yes, your highness.
I'm going to stretch my legs
I'm sorry.
Nervous?
I'm so scared...
Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
I'm glad you found what you were looking for.
No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
Trust me, it's her!
You're a princess...
But it's not	the money, Vlad.
What do you want?!
The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia...
I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay
I should go
Promise me she'll have her home.
Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?
You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?
This guy's on television! Alvy Singer, right? Am I right?
Your girl friend's name is Ralph?
I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie. You take a meeting with him.
Excuse... excuse me, when do I go on?
It-but it-it... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once? It doesn't make sense.
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
M'm.
La-de-da. If I-if anyone had ever told me that I would be taking out a girl who used expressions like "la- de-da"...
You have a car?  So...  I don't understand why... if you have a car, so then-then wh-why did you say "Do you have a car?"... like you wanted a lift?
Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.
I, uh... well, you're not from New York, right?
Wisconsin.
Nice car.
Your grammy!
I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?
I'll see yuh.
Neat?
Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.
Well, who's Sadie?
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
That's okay, 'cause I know exactly what that's like. Listen-
Yeah?
Hey, listen, listen.
Yeah.
Okay?
I'm gonna have a corned beef.
M'm, that was so nice. That was nice.
Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think. Big-
I've a very pessimistic view of life. You should know this about me if we're gonna go out, you know. I-I-I feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable.
M'hm.
I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
I have a tiny apartment.
Yes, it is.
Alvy, you were... Alvy, you were just great, I'm not kidding. It was- You were so neat.
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
M'hm.
Yeah.
Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?
What's- It's me, open up.
Are you okay?  What's the matter?  Are you all right? What-
What is this? What are you, since when do you read the "National Review"? What are you turning in to?
It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
Hey, what am I-your son? Whatta you mean? I-I came over to --
Oh, don't go, okay? Please.
Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter?
Oh, Jesus, really?
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
Remember, we had that thing.
What thing?
What's... you... well, what's the matter, You w-wanna go to that party?
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
God, it's so clean out here.
What?
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
Okay.  Check, please. Can I -can I... Can I... Can I...
Oh!
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.
'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.
Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?
Hey, come on, it's quiet now. We can- we can start again.
What-
My head is throbbing.
Where are you going?
Man, that's great. That's just great.
Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid.
Who said that?
without getting... well, let's put it this way...
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure.
Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?
Yes, I remember.  He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
I have some very good memories there.
Do you realize how immoral this all is?
Well, sit down.
No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting...
How about a ginger ale?
Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
The one with the V.P.L.
Imagine my surprise when I got your call, Max.
You fired the cleaning woman?
All right-so we can afford it.
Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.
Oh, that Randolph Hunt. You remember Randy Hunt, Annie. He was in the choir with you.
M'mmm.
Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.
No, no, no, not at all.
...of possibly working together.
Oh.
It could be freezing, it could be raining.
Absolutely not.
She's a constant surprise.
And you've only just met.
Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.
No, what?
Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay?
Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed.
Mac?  Oh there you are.  What are you doing, honey?  No more work.  Don't you feel breezy.
What what's about?
What a fucking day!  We only just got a sitter.  I don't know her from fucking Adam.  She could be a serial killer.  I'm going to have to call every ten minutes. You have to let me give out the number.
Why didn't you bring him?
What?
Borrow whatever you like.
I'd say it was down.
Let's get the kids.
He's gonna miss his flight.
And you're not the wife.
Fuck you.
That for us?
What a nose.  You missed your calling.
I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months.
I saw Lucy when I was in London, she seems okay.  It's hard to tell with her.
Are you my big brave boy?  Are you my brave hero?
Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors?
I don't think so.
I worry because you don't.  It's my job. I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
Yes.
I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the world.
Accept a compliment.
What?
You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
And she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake.
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
Otis!  No barking!
Not properly watered.
Listen to yourself...  Don't worry, it's alright.  We'll find him.  What's wrong with you?
Otis!!!!
Otis!!!!
This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs.
Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate.
It's a novel.
Who the fuck do you think you are?  The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life.  Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally.
Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.
Sally, for Christ's sake.
I'm a monster.  Exactly.
Me too.
Coffee?
I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?
Yes.
Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?
Don't I find what?
And so I always manage to, do you see? Like the book/script thing, do you see?
Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
Thanks, Mac.  And thanks for being so supportive about all this.  I really love you, you know.
Something soft.
Your Eames table is incredible.  And the B&B.  I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.
Oh, yes.  You know Ryan's been sober eight years.  And it's difficult if I... you know.  It's better if I don't.
Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction.
Would you sign it for me.  I'm sure this is inappropriate.
Lemon.
Eight years, though.  That's quite an accomplishment.
That's very nice.
I'm so sorry.
I didn't say a word.
I don't need a drug.
Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog!
Hi.  Monica and Ryan?
There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
And I'm overwhelmed.  And I want to do it justice.  And I hope we can spend time together.  And I'm gushing.  It's my worst quality.
Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich?
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.
Are you lovesick?
Oh, Jesus, Panes.  I can't, I can't believe that bitch is in my house.
It could be worse.
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
Like the last time.
So how are you really doing, Panes?
I'm worried about your Galiano.
How's the movie going?  Your movie.  You are making a movie, aren't you?
Why not?
So tell me, how's it going?
You're my best friend.
Thank you, Panes.
What did I do?
Monica and Ryan.
Oh my God, sorry.  I'm interrupting.
And here they are!
It's much more personal in here.
I trust you.
Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
Not nice.  Not kind.
Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're making the rest of us look bad...How come I haven't seen you around here before?
Tell me about it.
Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.
General -- we have to talk sometime!
You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?
-- At the <u>worker bar</u>!  You were pretty hot to trot then!
Well I guess that makes us even.
I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
Water...water...
Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're <u>not going to rescue you</u>?
And only you can become a Queen?
Come on, Z.
I felt the same way before I got married.  Confused.  Scared.
You did?
Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you.  Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind?
BARBATUS!  You -- you saved my life!
Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
Conversation...yes...well...  Wasn't she briefed?
But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
...Ants...
I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
Yeah, I know.
My mother.
From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
One napkin, coming up.  I wish we had some champagne to wrap it around.
Sheldrake?
Good night.
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
Would you like to?
Sure.
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.
In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off.
How many of those drinks did you have?
Much better.
Well, as long as you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me -- how about the three of us going out this evening -- you and me and the bowler -- stroll down Fifth Avenue -- sort of break it in --
Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
I don't understand --
It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that I got here in time -- and you're going to be all right --  -- isn't she, Doc?
Miss Kubelik --  -- you shouldn't be out of bed.
I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --
What kind of talk is that?  So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now.
You don't want me here --
Here. How about some breakfast?
You better figure it out -- exactly. Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night?
Someone from the office.
In his apartment.
He doesn't give a damn about me.
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
Give what up?
What do you call it when somebody keeps getting smashed up in automobile accidents?
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
Cut.
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
You really think so?
As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
Well, for one thing, you can't spell. And secondly -- if you did something like that -- you'd hate yourself.
It's very curious -- I could only find three and a half pair.
Tennis racquet? Oh, I remember -- I was cooking myself an Italian dinner.  I used it to strain the spaghetti. FRAN  Why not?
It's just that I'm the kind of guy who can't say no -- I don't mean to girls -- I mean --
A what?
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
I never thought he'd do it.
No, no.  Just waiting for a friend. Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
Yes, sir.
You do?
Who?
Oh.
Yes, sir.
Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
Morning, gentlemen.  Everything satisfactory? You like your office?
No, sir. That's very unfair -- especially to your wife.
Oh.  Well, if there's anything I can do for you --
That's just one of the privileges that goes with this job. You also get a nice little expense account, the use of the executive washroom --  Say, what happened to you, Baxter?
I see.
Now I'll have to borrow your key.
I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
Baxter, I picked you for my team because I thought you were a bright young man. You realize what you're doing? Not to me -- but to yourself. Normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor -- but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again. You dig?
Say, Baxter -- you gave me the wrong key.
No I didn't.
Baxter?
You?
Maybe you're using the wrong approach.
Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl -- there are millions of them.
Buddy-boy -- she won't keep that long -- not even on ice.  Listen, kid, I can't pass this up -- she looks like Marilyn Monroe.
We went to bat for you -- and now you won't play ball with us.
Dear Mr. MacIntosh --  Vanderhof, Public Relations. Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute.  All right, Miss Finch -- type up what we got so far.  Now what is it, Baxter?
Look, Mr. Vanderhof -- I've got you down here for tonight -- but I'm going to be using the place myself -- so I'll have to cancel.
Cancel? But it's her birthday -- I already ordered the cake --
That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
Quite an office -- name on the door -- rug on the floor -- the whole schmear.
You know, Baxter -- I'm doing some research at the Columbia Medical Center -- and I wonder if you could do us a favor?
I don't know -- I mean -- I wasn't here -- you see -- we had some words earlier -- nothing serious, really -- what you might call a lovers' quarrel --
Mister -- Miss -- such politeness!
Just as long as she's okay.
Yeah, wasn't I?
Still stuck on her, huh.
Ask anybody around here. As a matter of fact, when it's time for me to go -- and I may go just like that --  -- I have promised my body to the Columbia Medical Center.
The party's over.
Who?
Kubelik.
I see.  What do you think, Al? Can we help the man?
Sleeping pills.
So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor --
-- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
I don't believe you.
Not here, Fran. Can't we go some place else?
It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight.
Ring out the old year, ring in the new. Ring-a-ding-ding.
What are you talking about?
What guy?  Whose apartment is this, anyway?
Me? SHELDRAKE Thank you for giving that little pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party.
It won't happen again.
Hey, Dad -- why don't we put a fly in the nose cone and see if we can bring it back alive?
Where are you headed?
Look -- you know the girls -- Thta's Terri -- she was playmate of --
I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked --
Who the hell are you?
Part.
Delta ?
Let's talk about you.
I didn't know we had units up there in North Vietnam.
What are we doing here?
Flood.
I met the P.B.R. crew; they were pretty much all kids, except for Phillips, the Chief -- Gunner's Mate Third Class L. Johnson -- Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef -- Radio Operator Second Class T. Miller; they called him Mr. Clean.
The Delta closes off to us about ten  miles out of Hau Fat. We'll be able to pick up some supplies -- bit I think there are only two points we can draw enough water to get into the Nung River. It's all Charlie's turf from there on out.
Shot himself. What for ?
Yeah -- fishing village -- helicopters over there. Hueys, lots of 'em.
Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take Lance with you --
Get in there !
Anybody see some smoke ?
They nail him for it bad ?
Jesus -- that guy's too damn much.
You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet.
No, sir.
As I said, we can pay you in gold.
We don't want to bother you any, we --
Attacks repulsed, as I was saying.  This is only  for this war, Captain. Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese regular forces -- 15; South Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular forces and otherwise.  Americain -- 6. Of course, they were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain.
They far enough?
Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels Four -- bring it in on along tree line and huts.
My orders are from Com-Sec Intel -- B.L. Willard, 4th Recon --
No. Walked.
Can you trust them?
Music?
You were not coming here, to see me?
Do you?
You can't have water after morphine.
Oh Captain, that is so true.
You could never figure it because it doesn't make sense.
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
You get to know each other pretty well out there.
Both of us...
Are you finished surfing?
Which one's the Colonel's?
This one , Lance?
You think he'd of shot us?
You think?
That's me.
We'll be needing some supplies and fuel -- do you know anybody who can give me a hand?
This boat's a mess.
Simple. They don't want him to go.
You're Australian?
Sounds like he's gone crazy.
Did you know -- deeper in the jungle, upriver -- there are savages?
This -- Bob Hope or the like --
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
Well , who's in command here?
You talk about ecology -- there it is.
First you save my ass, now you want to kill me.  Make up your goddamn mind.
Remember that demon in the gut? Sometimes it's nothing more than wondering if the so-called civilized life has bred the balls and brains out of you.  That's what you want out of this, isn't it?
113  CONTINUED:
How long have you been up north?
She's dead.
Have you talked to Eric?
Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
Oh, sweetheart.  It's beautiful!
That's not what I meant.
Where's Corbett?
Go ahead.  Take the jeep.  I'll come to Cache with Bob when he gets here.
You got two counts against you -- trapping out of season and poaching on restricted land.
We're not sitting here 'til November.  There's a cargo plane coming to Devil's Cauldron in four days, and I'm putting you on it.
Damn lucky this storm didn't blow down when we were on those baldheaded mountains.  It continues, we better stay put.
Folks come to Alaska for a real short list of reasons:  Money. Adventure.  Solitude.  Those cover most everyone.  But frontiers also draw another type of man.  One with a demon in his gut.  He comes to the edge of the world to face that demon, and lay it to rest.
Yeah?
Have to get these wet things off.
Stay awake!  You want to go hypothermic?
You broke the radio, remember?
Relax.  One more day without drink won't kill you.  Right, Sam?
If that was all, fine.  But carving him up, stranding the others, that's too fucking much. Is everything that walks, crawls, flies or swims fair game to you?
Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
Look, Mr. Desmond, I didn't count on it turning this ugly.
Neff, you know better than this...
You can't see past your lousy little assignment, sniffing around the pipeline.  The few voters there are in this district look up to Corbett, and I'm not about to alienate them.
This miserable wilderness is a state of the union.  Policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box.  That's the beauty of it -- these icebox cowboys are living a century too late.  Get them on your side, it's like buying Manhattan for beads.  With a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the New World.
Fuck you.
I'm too old for this shit.
Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe more for lettin' him loose.  I was up in my cache.  Saw the Northland man come talk to you.
There you go.  Wilder's always chummy with the fuckin' Bambi-lovers.
Go easy.
Look, we pull Ben's ass out of the fire, I'll get you a whole damn crate of Snickers bars.
...Ben never sent a signal.
This is Sam Wilder, Marshal in Devil's Cauldron.  Had some killings here.  I got a suspect; be real nice if someone came and took him off my hands.
On a good day I couldn't spare a crosswalk guard.  But now, no way.  Folks're batshit with the weather turning sour.  Bring him in yourself.
Go ahead.
Spencer's doing fine. So what are you saying, that you're frustr...
What? Please? Now? Tell me?!
Only in the emergency room or when he was well.
Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves?
I'm starving.
What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
He's gotta fight to breathe. His asthma can just shoot off the charts -- he's allergic to dust and this is New York and his immune system bails on him when there's trouble so an ear infection...  Is this bothering you?
An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.
Spencer.
Okay.
Sorry.
This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...
The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.
Note. Put it in the note.
Two days.
So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.
Well, ah... that's a personal question.
There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might...
I don't.
Here are the keys to my apartment. I'm going to park you in my place while I take Carol home.
That seems like a good choice.
Grouchy?
Were you asleep?
Can you not be violent?
I'm sorry... are you okay?
Why? What have you been thinking about?
But what about...
If you want to see me you will not do this. You will make an appointment...
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?
How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
Simon, you've got to get dressed.
Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'
It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
Which color was that?
Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please.
Go away.
Rot in hell, Melvin.
Another place where?
I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out.  Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life.
How do you write women so well?
Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.
That was Peterson back there.  That goes to the expressway for the airport.
Bain.  Michael Bain.
Hey.  What I don't get was why didn't you take the shot inside the restaurant?  I mean you had me, a free shot.  That's what I would have done.
You would be.
I'm on the scent.
Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.
Deadline?
The contract?
I have been sitting on a contract from Cleveland for six days because of you.
You think this is a fucking joke?
A player?
Nikita?  She helped me find you.
What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
I figure that means these are worth ten times that, maybe more.
You want me to pump?
Nikita?
'Them'?
He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.
Yes.
I don't need the money.
How?
Where you wanted to be?
How did you get into the business?
You went from high school to the Agency?
No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program.
But you knew what they were training you for?
Ahhhh...
Women?  No... not really.
Because you are a women.
The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
Why?
Hey, where are you?
No.
Do you think about the game?
Yes.
No.
Okay.
He won't be looking for you.  Just be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your sunglasses on.
You should knock.
Sorry.
Taiwan.
Transmits and receives.
Check.
Then, we wait.
The sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank.
Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
We split the money?
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
For Nicholai?
Yes.
He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business.  To disappear to some empty Greek island.
What did he say?
Do you have ulcers?
They're worth less points.
I didn't notice them.
And you were drilling these holes...?
Can I ask you something?
Yes.
I didn't want to complicate the situation.
It can be.
Four minutes.
Okay.
The point is, they are paying for information.  Real information.  Not tooth paste brands.  Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
Jesus!  Why didn't you tell me?
Then, I'll sail alone.
I think I've heard of you.
You're pretty famous aren't you?
Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
What are you thinking about?
I'm thinking about Moonpies.  Ain't that funny?  I haven't had a Moonpie since I was ten years old. Right now, I'm thinking how much I'd love one.
You wish to close this account today?
Hmm..Smells good. Cheers!
No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
What we need is a space for real performance art. A cultural exchange for radical expressionism.
Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
No, he was talking about girls, I think.
Yeah, you're in luck there's two of them, the other's in there.
I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
Tell them we're working for the University.
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
Well, don't get carried away.
I'll try not to, I'll leave that to you. Anyway, there's still plenty more of it.
'cause you stink of booze.
Perfect, but I can't use it right now, I've got to get these locks done; it's a matter of priorities.
I'd love to get in there.
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
I'll rig up something don't worry - Do you think I could bash through with that little hammer?
Yeah, her name's Kavlova, why?
Nope.
Just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better.
Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
Let's split.
Afternoon!
My God! What happened?
What are you on about?
I had a visit from the British Embassy. They think I'm a stray soccer hooligan.
I stopped by your office. Henry was steaming, he says he's going to throw you out of the window and that you never worked at the Bugler.
Did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?
Did you see anything in the files?
What do you want me to do?
Yeah, Dave Walters.
42 56 76......... Okay, you wait at Dave's for my call tomorrow, if you don't hear from me by three o'clock, send that note and get out of the country fast.
God, I think I need a holiday.
What?
Your home address is 18 Thornton Avenue, Coventry.
I've been around.
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
Don't give me this Kat, I'm doing it for you and your country.
Doug I can't, I've got to be at work by eight. You promised to take me home.
No.
That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
It was a mistake, I never wanted to hurt you, but it had to end sooner or later and now, well now I love someone else.
There's three thousand crowns, it's all I got.
Can we charge admission?
I'll do my best. Is the place open.
No thanks, I must go, but maybe you could get some beers for the guys.
Great....How long will it go for?
No, it should be over soon.
A champion of lost causes huh?
What would you like, beer?
Don't you have a girlfriend?
Why don't we both forget about him?
A kind of freedom.
Thanks, but I don't intend to stay.
And the students?
How do I know this isn't a trap?
Yeah.
And a fifty foot extension lead?
All I'm saying Honey is run the thing past me for Christ's sake before you get up and broadcast the crap.
Josh!
What for?
So, what have you got to say for yourself? Was he good in bed?
Why are there still such headlines?
It was crazy not to have destroyed them
I'm not hanging. I'm fixing my car --
We talked. He wanted to get a bite -- after. I said no.
You do. You're handsome and charming.
But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment --
You.
Because, growing up, books were my world.
'They won't.'
It's private.
You think so.
The world of the dead?
But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
The play's going to be really good.
Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
Before we do this.
We can measure wind.
Loved?
What'd you tell your father?
Mars.
You're going to take a year off? Join the Peace Corps -- ?
'Love is always patient and kind. It is never boastful or conceited -- '
By accident --
Praying.
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
So what did we just make?
What else? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
Listen you little Asshole, I oughta --
What's N.R.C.?
I've been calling you for five minutes! Didn't you hear me?
How was school today?
Fine.
Here's your jacket!
Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
I'm usually nervous myself on first dates...but not tonight. It's funny, but somehow, I feel like....like I know you.
Now, George! Dinner's ready now!
Eileen, Chinese food again?
Dad, you seen the drill?
George, she's beautiful, right? She's nice, she's decent, she's the kind of girl you'd like to marry, right? And there's nothing in the world you'd like more than to take her to that dance, right?
Well... yeah...
Christ, it's a miracle I was even born! 
You're not picking a fight, you're coming to her rescue. Maybe we'd better go over the plan again. Where are you gonna be at 8:55?
You mean, you're gonna --
Yeah, explode it up your ass!
Unfortunately, the way things are going, you may get your wish. You may see the entire annhiliation of the world. If not, you'll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources. We can already see the air we breathe, not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes. We'll  see all of our oil reserves depleted, in fact, all of our energy sources. Yes, you people have a lot to look forward to -- a lot to see.
March 11th.
Okay, Martin. You have a good evening now.
Pro, the sun's out!
So what? We'd be rich!
How did you know?
I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?
I don't recall ever seeing it before.
That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
Obviously!  
Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
I run this place! 
No way!
Me neither. I've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. You think yours did?
Well, he's gone.
Oh yeah?
Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.
Where'd you get them antlers?
Yeah, I guess.
I'll catch up with you.
Does he bite?
You lost that one?
We did it, Ray.
Kit... Kit, I've got a question for you.
Holly's over here, Kit, if you want to see her.
Sure is pretty.
Listen. I got a lot of respect for her, sir.  That's about as good a one as I know to tell you.
What's going to happen to Jack and me?
Oh, incidentally, my last name is Carruthers. Sounds a little too much like "druthers", doesn't it?
He'll say that?
There you go.
Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?
You're a redhead.
Yeah, but I don't like it.
Yeah.
What?
But it would hurt.
Are you sure?
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
I don't know.
Maybe we should've tried to hop it.
It was going too fast.
What?
You smoke Pall Mall?
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
Yes?
Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?
Listen, ah... We're going to take the Cadillac for a while. How'd that be?
Yes.
Maybe.
November 1, thirty days have September, April, June, and November...when short February's done, all the rest have thirty-one. October 31st!  Halloween!  Don't you get it?  Orson Welles!
Forgive the butterfingers, Buckaroo.  Casper Lindley, Knight of the Blue Shield, at your disposal.  And my son, Scooter.
Ever since that phony phone call from the President.  Look at this. What is it?
Antidote to what?  Whose disguises?
Got a half a tuna sandwich.
Dr. Lizardo's a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy, a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours.
The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was orange...
I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
You're a welcome sight...
Everybody ready?  How do we look?  Do we look okay?
Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy?  The invisible body?
Dead.  Damnit!
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?
Open up or I'll shoot it off.
She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...
Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.
Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
But John Whorfin said kill her.
Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  It's unusual, but no cause for alarm.  Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same problem.
What's his problem?
Pick those up, Reno.
Doesn't look anything like her to me.
Please, Barton.
I see.
It's alright, Barton. You don't have to write actual scenes?
Barton!
That's hamburger grease, Bill.
M'honey pretends to be impatient with me, Barton, but she'll put up with anything.
No, I – I didn't mean to sound –
W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
What's that?
I'll jus' walk on down to the Pacific, and from there I'll... improvise.
But Lipnik said he wanted to look at the script, see something by the end of the week.
...Look, you're confused? You need guidance? Talk to another writer.
I don't understand-
I can't write anything by tomorrow.
You don't say. That's a tough racket. My hat's off to anyone who can make a go of it. Damned interesting work, I'd imagine.
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life – why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
You're all right, Charlie. I'm glad you stopped by. I'm sorry if – well I know I sometimes run on.
...This must be boring you.
...Probably sounds a little grand coming from someone who's writing a wrestling picture for Wallace Beery.
...Yeah, okay.
How did you know about that?
...Jesus, Barton, what the hell is this?  What're we gonna do?
It's more than I've got.
Welcome to the Hotel Earle. May I help you, sir?
Rez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a week payable in advance. Checkout time is twelve sharp, only you can forget that on account you're a rez. If you need anything, anything at all, you dial zero on your personal in-room telephone and talk to me. My name is Chet.
Okey-dokey, go ahead.
His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
...I thought you said you were a writer.
Tell us where the heads are, maybe they'll go easy on you.
We got a treatment on it yet?
When did you start drinking again?
I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
It's bullshit.  You know it is.
No?
It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
Baby-sitting.  Rookie cop.
What was she like?
We were in some of the same classes.
No, Nick, please --
I don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything.  We went to bed -- what was it? -- ten or fifteen times?  It wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations.
My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --
She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
How long were you having sex with him?
Do you have a cigarette?
But you said you liked men to use their hands.
How did you feel when I told you Johnny Boz had died -- that day at the beach.
I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
I'm tired.
Don't get too cocky.
What if I call you Nicky?
Yes.
How's your new book?
I should have known.  I came into the house when you were down on the beach.  She looked at me so strangely.  She left right after you.  I shouldn't have let her watch us. She wanted to watch me all the time.  She tried to kill you, didn't she?
For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me.
I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.
I don't know.
You still think I kill people, don't you?
How'd you get in here?
I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --
I had another one of you guys down here from Frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question.  What's this about anyway?
Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
He had a girlfriend?
I hope I helped you out.
Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.
I got tired of being played with.
She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.
In that little pissant car of yours? Hell, no.  I ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- I'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch.
What was the motive?
I love it.  She's got a hundred million bucks.  She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.
So what do we do -- nothing?
I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the record did you kill him?
I.A.'s going to talk to you more about Nilsen.  They're handling the investigation, we're not. Stay in touch with Dr. Gardner, it'll help on the evaluation.
I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
I told you to stay away from Tramell.
I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
Ten bucks apiece.
Wow... Stop giving them away.  I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me?
Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
Bruno called. In Europe, people are saying you're gonna die from drugs. They think they can cash in on your death.
Chill, man! Be cool! This isn't even my apartment!
Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?
Yes, but as a black painter –
I use a lot of colors – not only black.
Not what?
Yup.
It's Andy again.
It's Maria Portos. What should we do?
About what?
Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else.
Good.
Good. What do you have?
She's good.
No, don't tell me – you just got fired by your crazy boss.
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?
... What's the matter?
It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
It looks done.
Hi.
What's your name, man?
Wanna Mac?
That's a beautiful name. French?
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
So shut up and keep painting..
What time is it?
You don't have any!!!
YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.
Selina ... more facets than Vicki, huh?  Funny, but sort of mysterious...
"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
Pouring myself into my work.
You almost sound enthusiastic.
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
"We"?  You and...
... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
And the truth frightened her?
It's the so-called "normal" guys who always let you down.  Sickos never scare me.  At least they're commited.
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
Same here.  So why'd you come tonight?
Ingenious costume.  Let me guess ... Trust-fund goody-goody?
Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City.
You buy this "blurry" business?
The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference.  By the way, how's Fred Adkins, your old partner?
Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows <u>I</u> know.  But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic!
We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those, Oswald.
Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?
Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.  Personally.  Me.  I did.
I could have made it, you know.  I didn't need your help.
Alfred has supported me my whole life.  Now I'm going to pay him back. I'm going to liberate him from his dismal life of servitude.
Alpha.  Got it.  What the hell is attack plan Alpha?
Nice suit.  And today you are?
I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
She knows who we are.
They're overly protective.  You're Not going to hurt me are you, Ms...
Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
Forget the stars.  Look here, at the Earth, our mother, our womb.  She deserves our loyalty and protection. And yet you spoil her lands, poison her oceans, blacken her skies. You're killing her.
Tell me, billionaire, would you warm faster to my pleas if I looked more like Ms. January here?
Make a choice, Bruce.  Her or me.
Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed.
Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
That's no batlight, it's a birdcall.
Let me guess, Plant Girl? Vine Lady? Ms. Moss?
You will rescue my wife
Make yourself right at home.
There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
What do you mean?
A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time.
I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
Why, indeed?
What?
...A bat.
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
Let's just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.
We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
Help Chase. I'll be back.
Oh please. You're blind as a bat.
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
What? Oh, it's very impressive.
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.
A lot of what happened is jagged. Pieces missing. I can't really remember. I just get flashes. Usually in my dreams. I'd kind of gotten used to them. At least accepted them....
I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.
Listen, Dick. Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away. It'll make it worse.
You don't understand. It's an addiction. You fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain's back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a choice.  I want better for you.
...I missed Two-Face by a heartbeat. When we catch him, you gotta let me kill him!
Exactly. And once you'd killed him you'd be lost. Like me.  All this has to be a choice. Otherwise...it's a curse.
Bruce, you can't.
Who is it?
I'll show you it works.
Please. I swear I won't say noth-
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
Where are you sending Batboy this time?
A-14.
Mr. Wayne is out for the day.
Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it.
...Not even a 'thank you'?
Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
They don't come down here. They're afraid of the lights.
Great.  Give me a grant.
What did you see?
There's terror everywhere.  If you train yourself to look for it.
But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even --
I'll take you home if you'd like.
Maybe we should just kiss.
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
No one would miss me.
All this apparatus, Vicki... This house, and the money, and the power ... It was never mine. It was something I inherited. Bruce Wayne was something I inherited.  All I ever hoped for was someone who could see through Bruce -- who could see me -- and not be frightened.
Ohhhh... You don't mean that.
WHAT?
How'd you know it was me?
No.
Allie, he's not.
Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
There were three strawberries.
Maybe I ought to think about getting another job.
Ah, Mr Bean ...
Ahm.....
Yes.  I'11 mention it to him.  But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know?
Say that again, son.
Glad to hear it.  Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?
No!
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Actually, we just wanna watch TV...
Hey Butt-Head, why's that guy holding a sign?
Huh huh. This says Beavis.
This desert is stupid. They need to put a drinking fountain out here.
Hey Butt-Head, isn't there supposed to be like, water in cactuses?
Whoa, my life is cool!
I always thought there was something wrong with him. Heh heh heh.
Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
Uh, I probably will, but not you. You're too much of a butt-monkey. Huh huh.
Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole...
Beavis.
He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
Chief, you know that guy whose camper they were whacking off in?
Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
One more thing. Mah wife's got this leather satchel. It's black, about this big. I need ya to bring it back. It's real important. Sentimental value... Any questions so far?
She sure does.
Ah'm gonna blow you both to hell!
You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
Really? That's where we're from.
Two hours.
I can't clean anything.  The vacuum is out in the garage.  I can't leave the house.  Why don't they tell us something?  Where are all the other dead people in the world?  Why is it just you and me?
Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  As long as I never have to wash dishes again.
What's she doing here?
That little girl saw us.
Are you crazy?  She can't hear you.
That guy is in our cemetery.  Oh, Adam.
Well, I don't know... We don't get many visitors.
Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam?
Go ahead... third time's a charm.
Honey, I think that was a mistake.
I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
And your sushi was remarkable.
N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots.
We've been given a gift here, honey.  A real live little girl. She likes us a lot.  She needs us. Maybe that's why we died so young, to keep us from getting so... attached to <u>things</u>.  The house, antiques, your model.  Look at us. We didn't have room for anyone.
What...?
What time is it?
Nobody else can.
Aren't you dead?
Hell is other people.  You obviously don't read much. Besides things seem pretty quiet here.  You should thank God you didn't die in Italy.  The Deetzes.  Okay.  Have you been studying the manual?
We tried.
We have to start simpler, is that it?
Handbook?  When...?
No.
Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is really real!  From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph!
Jane, don't send photographs of our house around the country! We're not interested in selling.
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.
Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.

I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan up here?  Hunan?
I feel like we've been at war, Charles.
At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
Stepmother's...
Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
I don't care from guilt.  I just want to <u>see</u> them.
Any particular kind?
I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
Okay?
It does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts -- that they actually appear in <u>sheets</u>!
Is this the key to the attic?
Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
Their wedding clothes.
... Straight out?
... It's five of, you'd best get on in there.
Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out here.
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
... Do you think we should look for him?
May I ask your name?
No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
Yes.
Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.
Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.
I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
Oh, I like that very much.
That's good. I like to watch, too.
Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.
Hello, Sid.
... Are you sure you like it?
Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall yield the pleasure of your company to others.
Yes, I agree, I think so too.
Yes, it is very good!
Yes. I like that name very much.
That's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I call you Chauncey?
... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?
... Chauncey... Chauncey...
Yes. I would like to do that.
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
... Then you really are a gardener?
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
Yes sir, I guess that's true smallest room in the house.
I see.
... Back up those stairs - damn... That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again...
How were you paid?
Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just fine with me - I'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner...
... In the garden?
Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out... How are you feeling?
Do you feel well enough for that?
... Ben, really...
Good evening, Mrs. Rand.
... How are the kids getting along?
I can certainly understand that...
Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
Clearly, yes comrade.
I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.
But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat.
... Mr. President, how good to see you.
It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific!
You take care too, Bobby.
Okay.
Oh yeah, he's good.
Thank you.
Morning.
Enjoy.
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
Why'd you do it, Craig?
Yeah. You want a beer?
I'll meet you on the turnpike.
Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
I have to go back, Craig. Being inside did something to me. All of a sudden everything made sense. I knew who I was.
What, are you nuts? That's Oprah talking.
You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.
What's that?
Yes.
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
He's a lucky man.  Do I know him?
I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?
Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig Schwartz. I can explain. We operate a little business her that... simulates, for our clientele, the experience of... being you, actually.
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
I said "yes."
Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp?
I'll keep that in mind, sir.
Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. “Ladies,” I begin. “I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven...
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
Ah. yes, the little door.  There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it.
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
Moving story.
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
Just.
So, tell me about yourself. If you can get your mind out of the gutter long enough, dog-boy.
Yikes.
There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike.
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
Good. We'll sell tickets.
Tickets to Malkovich?
But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.
Hello. Wendy.
You've got to tell Craig what's going on. He must never leave Malkovich.
I'll be with you always, my friends. Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak.
No. Don't be an ass.
Can I be anyone I want?
Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire!
And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
A scary dream?
Gehginnis ondah foam?
Fork ah did?
Thank you, Floris.
Do you dream often?
You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?
Anybody else?
But of course.
Oh, be still my heart.
Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
You followed your heart, my child, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.
But now we've lost access to Craig.
No, I didn't know that.
Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
How do we do that?
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
Mr. Malkovich?
I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?
That was incredible. You're brilliant!
You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
Why you never go back to Lady Jone's and learn your letters? You liked going there I remember. Seeing the other children. Then all a sudden, you stop.
Folks come. Folks go.
Well?
Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what?
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
I'm saying they came into my yard.
CAN THEY GET IN HERE?
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama.
Yes?
Well, if you want my opinion...
Well, good luck with the job.
They good whitefolks?
No. I mean work work.
Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
Could be that fall you took.
She likes to see you off in the morning.
DON'T LOVE HER TOO MUCH.
Mama let me help you.
Out where?
Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there.
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?
Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.
For what?
Oh yeah. Oh that's load off. I thought everybody gone crazy.
Oh but we got to. How we gonna know our price in the future? How are children's children's children gonna know what they cost? Who's gonna tell them? What are they gonna pay for us, if we free?
I don't believe that. I won't.
I was there Paul D...There in the yard. When she did it.
You don't know what I think.
You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
Don't know. Just shot up one day from a stump.
Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at all.
I'm looking for a gal name of Judy. Works over by the slaughterhouse. Said she lived on Plank Road.
Hiya Allan.
Fuck.
Where'd she been?
The Gundersons.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Okay.  Vee take ze money you haf on you und vee call it eefen.
Where you going, Dude?
Were you listening to the story, Donny?
I was bowling--
Burkhalter.
It's already posted.
Uh-huh.
Am I wrong?
Who's in pyjamas, Walter?
Uh-huh.
That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when--
I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
Jeez.  Think he's got room for one more?
Color?
Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust, coloration.
No.  Here.
Which one was Logjammin'?
Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off manually.
Is that what that's a picture of?
He fixes the cable?
Now I got--
Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does?
Jeffrey--
Increases?
I want a child.
Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail- roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my--
So who--
Donny!  Please!
Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it is no dream.
What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier.  What's in the fucking carrier?
Come on Walter, it's just--it's Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a little, it's just a game.
Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain.
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course--
You mean--beyond pacifism?
Anyway.  How much they offer you?
Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
Yeah.  So as long as we get her back, nobody's in a position to complain. And we keep the baksheesh.
What'd he say?  Where's the hand- off?
Huh?
I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
You didn't think I was rolling out of here naked!
How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--
Someone else's--where the fuck are they gonna--
I figure my only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off.
Not if I have anything to say about it.
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me a very secure feeling.
Yeah.
And yet his son is a fucking dunce.
Is this your homework, Larry?
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
I mean we totally fucked it up, man. We fucked up his pay-off.  And got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didn't do anything.  Huh?
His million bucks was never in it, man!  There was no money in that briefcase!  He was hoping they'd kill her!  You throw out a ringer for a ringer!
Okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency?
Yeah?  What do you think happens when you get divorced?  You turn in your library card?  Get a new driver's license?  Stop being Jewish?
He can't walk, Walter!
Well can we--
We're scattering the fucking ashes!
Shut the fuck up.  Hello?
So no funny stuff.  Okay?
So you know they were trying to piss on your rug--
'Scuse me?
Where's my goddamn money, you bum?!
Impressive.
<i>You'll</i> take him.
Two years.
I'll heal.
He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too fast.  They burn out.  That's why they're having to feed so often.  Their systems are self destructing.
If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
You don't want to go there.
Did you think I wouldn't?
Where were you, Whistler?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Where the hell have you been?
And so will we.
Thought you were dead.
Gonna try and OD Whistler on a retroviral cure.
Kiss your ass goodbye, Reinhardt.
His name is Jared Nomak.
Not that I'm in contact with.
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
Where'd you dig up this shit-bird anyway?
The hell are you fiddling with there?
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
Get in. You’re leaving.
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then.
Is something wrong, my friend?
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.
Some kind of archive --
You care about him, don't you?
My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.
I've been better --
How long have we been driving?
I was afraid that might happen.
These are my people now. I'm one of them.
What?
The shadows suit us, Frost. We've existed this way for thousands of years. Who are you to challenge our ways?
How many of you are there?
LaMagra --
LaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a spirit, requiring a flesh and blood host in order to manifest himself.
There's no need for any of this. Your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when --
I was wrong about you, Blade. You were never one of us. You're a traitor to your race.
All right, let's start with the basics -- why do vampires need to drink blood?
Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.
Basically you'd have to re-write the victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin.
--and if she ever did--
I don't...I don't understand them myself.
--bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
What're you doing there?
Trying to find the energy.
--the witch kills children--
Cheery little place.
The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.
Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.
No offense, sweetheart: fuck you.
Why is there no "our" here?
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
You feel no need to get married or anything.
I don't know. Nightmare.
I want to see the tapes.
For once could you just sit down, shut up, and give something a <u>chance</u>?
--you should get back into bed.
No.
Then I'm going--
I want to see something!
Why?
My ass--you saw those four fucking baboons put 'em there!
I don't think it was them.
Turn the tapes back on.
Does it hurt?
I got a friend at a Lab. I could get the whole thing blown-up, enhanced--
And let it be known--before we even get to Burkittsville--it's gonna be an eighteen thousand times better movie--for half the cost--
Fire escape??
It's <u>freezing</u>.
This is her equally on-the-rag boy- friend, Nick Leavitt--
--they're from UMass, doing some kind of fucking term paper--
No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone.
Let's get inside.
Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.
Oooh. Oooh.
For a blur?
Still working on it.
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
She <u>wasn't</u> a witch.
Finally got her back to sleep.
Okay. Hypothetically.
We are being fucked with here, someone or something.
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
Domini's the only logical explanation.
What the fuck's going on here?
I'm talking to Taos, New Mexico--
--yes, Ma'am, can I help you with anything else?--
She wants me to talk to you, Heather.
What happened to my Dad??
...Ray stole a shitload of money from Marty. Until both of 'em calm down I'm not getting involved.
...Drive me to a motel?
See a guy.
Who was it?
I don't know, he didn't say anything.
I knew it. 'Cause we wouldn't have heard anything if it was him. He's real careful. Fact is, he's anal.
...Mm-hmm.
...I don't know, wasn't it you? Maybe a burglar broke in, and you found--
Remy.
I own the place.
...Friday?
...I don't know. Sometimes I think there's something wrong with him. Like maybe he's sick? Mentally?... Or is it maybe me, do you think?
No.
Sign.
I don't know. Motel... Abby--
Yeah.
Then what'd you come here for?
So, uh... this wouldn't interest you.
...What?
Ya catch any fish?
It's taken care of. The less you know about it the better.
What's this?
That's not the point.
What's the point?
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
...I don't want that asshole near my money. I don't even want him in the bar.
Is Marty here?
Got a problem, Meurice?
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
Detective Williams here. yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day. when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though. I can't.
I guess you've seen some bad things.
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
Okay?
For now. Alright. you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon.  I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different.  He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
Yes, but.
Nobody.
I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
I . I don't know.
Do you like talk like that?
Thank you. honey.
Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
Do you love me?
Sometimes I think I do.
Oh no.
It's okay. it's okay.
Hey? . You like to walk.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
How is Central these days?
What do you know about the ear?. anything?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan?
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Oh, okay. can I call?
That's what I thought.
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Shoot.
Great. Hey. I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things. that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
Okay.
NO.
You want to dance?
No.
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
God. you scared me.
He comes over to study.
Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
What are watchin' this junk for?
Come on out a minute, okay?
I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.
Where do you guys want to count?
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Surprise.
George, I went to the doctor.  I don't have two years.
I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole.  Even if they cut my sentence in half I'll be seventy-three years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here.  I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen.
I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.
Why are you speaking?
No.
We want some grass.
You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred pounds a week.
I don't think so.
Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too.
I want my kid out of protective custody. Now.  No fucking around.  My wife and my kid on a plane tonight.  I sign when they call me safe and sound.
No fucking way.
If you don't mind me asking, what is the reason you are in this place?
I'm tired, Diego.  Go to bed.
We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
Yeah, I'm out.
How are we doing?
Thirty-six hours.  I can't believe it. Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.
Weight it.  If it's sixty pounds, it's three.  If it's fifty, it's two-point five.
What?
Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.
Yeah.  Nice.
So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?
But, never mind.  I am thinking we can do much together.  This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business.  To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem.  And I don't like problems.
So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?
Family.
Money.
Yeah.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
What are you going to do?
I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices.  You know, the police are looking for you.
Dad.
She's angry.  It's all over the news.
It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
George.
Figured what out?
Do I know you?
I don't know.  My name is George.
Jesus Christ.
Look, Mirtha.  She's walking.
Can you lift the furnace.  I need money.
Not in front of the kid.
Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.
I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony.
Is she here?  George, Kristina hates you.  You fucked her over one too many times.  And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
Swear on my life.
I know, Dad.  I love you too.
Okay, George.
Very nice.  I'll take it.
What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
Not that far, only halfway.  You sure you know what you're doing?
Nice weed, huh?
This is bullshit, George.  We're never going to find anything down there.
Dien Bien Phu?
Which "district" do you belong to?
What's happened to you?
What ... What must I decide?
With an unloaded pistol?
It's better to split up, to increase our chances. We must change hiding places, and change them continually ... In the meantime, we must make new contacts, replace our arrested brothers, reorganize our sections--
With the others. They are trying to stop the people.
I think it'll be a success ...
Tell me ... Where is this rue de Thèbes?
You seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive ...
How you doin' Mister D?
So -- where do we start?
I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
What did he say about Miss Lawson?
Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
It would be an added stress to his heart.
What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.
Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier?
He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.
Why would she want that?
She's innocent.
I'm just curious to see if Mr. Troxell reconstructed anything else.
What's happening to you, Frank? You're acting like you're on trial here.  This has become personal to you.
You don't know what you're talking about.
I'll rephrase the question.  Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
Can I go?
A little after eleven.
I had some papers to pick up.
No -- never.
What about Miss Lawson?
How did he look?
I couldn't help myself.  You get lost inside a women like her.  It was like a drug.  It was the best sex I ever had.
No.
You're still angry, aren't you? Isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at Miss Lawson?
No.
No.
Yes.
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
Then what happened?
I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole if that's what you're thinking.  I'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to Andrew.  I'd find their little toys all over the place.
Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.
I don't know.  I'm not sure.
Isn't it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought?
You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off.
Then you would have gotten your money?
Hi, Joe.
Frank!
This is your house.
I'm the photographer.
Yes -- she did.
You lied to me!
I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
Why would she lie?
I'm glad you have such confidence in me.
I knew you were thinking that.  I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
The kids at school say she humped Mr. Marsh to death.
Do it quickly, Mr. Dulaney.
This is not relaxing.
I swear -- the both of you.  Some example you set.
I'll talk to him later.
No.
I know.
No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch.
I didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
How bizarre!
What?!
"-- going over and over in my mind every detail, every moment of our time together and I ask myself, "What happened to me in Madison County?" I struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we're on separate roads. But then I look through the lens of my camera, and you're there. I start to write an article and I find myself writing it to you. It's clear to me now we have been moving towards each other, towards those four days, all our lives --
This is crazy. She waits till she's dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was.
I found out who Lucy Delaney is.  Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
Yeah. But I thought she died.
Boy. All these years I've resented not living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I could've moved back to Iowa... Are you drunk?
Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage.
Did we want to?
That's it.
If I'm not taking you away from anything.
There's a wonderful smell about Iowa -- very particular to this part of the country. Do you know what I mean?
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
Oh. When did you move back?
You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.
No, really?
Men sill give women flowers, don't they? I mean, as a sign of appreciation? I'm not that out of date, am I?
No, not at all --  except those are poisonous.
Well, thank you for all your help, Mrs. Johnson.
No, your kids.
I doubt that.
He's very... clean.
Would you like to stay for dinner?  There aren't many choices in town and ... anyway, you'd have to eat alone. So would I.
Help cook?
Oh my God...  You're blushing.
Then what happened?
I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
Why did you stop?
Are you all right?
Francesca?
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
No. But I love them just the same.
That's not what you're saying. I know it's not the same. What you're saying is, it's not as good. Or it's not as normal or proper.
Francesca?
No. I was just... No.
Oh, sure. Great.
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
Oh, I'm sorry.
What are you doing?
Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
Stop it!
I DON'T WANT TO NEED YOU!
I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
You feeling better Franny?
It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.
'Bout 4:30.
"I had forgotten this. I had somehow remembered it being more his fault, his decision. Then I remembered we made love in that field before we left for home. And I remembered it was my idea. I remembered tearing his shirt and biting his body, hoping he would kidnap me. I had forgotten that too. And I wondered, as I sat there... how many other things I'd forgotten."
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
They're not going to find her!
Your mother left explicit instructions that she wished to be cremated.
Apparently just before her death.
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
Your father was his best friend.  He loved Jeremiah.  So he must hate him the most of all now.  He'll take his time. But even if it is too late.  If your father is dead.  It's not over.  The door has to be closed.
Just some flies.
Oh yeah, I guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio.
Shit.
Where's the others?
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Climb out to where?
Clean your mouth, or I will.  Those boys had no business messing down there.  Go places you're not meant to be -- that's what you get.
Looking to score?
Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high.
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
Where we'll always be...
But.
They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
I don't understand it.  You were my Man. Since we was grasshoppas.  I always looked after you.  You had a piece of everything I had.
Wait, Jimmy.  Think about it.  You woulda done the same thing if you was me.
You said the vision, the images.  They're just that.  Just pictures.  They can't hurt you.  That's what you always said.
Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.
I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
Told you so.  Alright.  We tried.  Let's go home.
In his grave there was a cloth or a dress or something.  Covered with blood.
That place is already bad luck.
My momma says every house is two houses. Every street, two streets.  There's a whole city, a whole world, kinda beside, on top, just below this one.  The city of the dead.
Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
The dead get out?
Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
Bill!  Bill?!
What are we doing down here?
I been watching you.  You done good. Invested wisely.  Respectable businessman now.  Just like you always wanted.
And you?  Still a pig.  Just a much fatter one.
Maybe so.  Maybe so.  But that ain't why I came to see you.  You sold the building.
You're right.  One of my associates sold the building last month.
Fair enough for the shit.  But I think a little bonus is due for knocking out the competition.
Why don't y'all check out the rest?  I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up.  Warm this place up, you'll see.  It has serious potential.
I thought you were bringing the Colonel?
Need any help with those bags, Ma'am?
You want to get into this now?
Just admit it, Caesar.
No, Gino!
I didn't expect --
Not bad.  What for?
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
Caesar, I'm leaving.
They were early.
What?
Caesar, maybe we should run --
All right, Johnnie, you want to play it this way, I can play it this way. You want to know who made a mistake, why don't you open the case.
Violet!
Try to keep the extra batteries for your aid around.
What?  How about a drink?
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks, though.
Now, where the fuck is my money?
Where is it?
Now why don't you go watch some TV or something?
I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower.
Ma'am, you have to open the door.
I guessed you were straight black.
No, but Caesar does.  He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.
Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?
You have to ask?
Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it "The |Business."
They took over a club I was working at.  Caesar started managing it.
Shit, here we go.
You didn't want to see me, did you?
What choice?
These people are serious, Violet. If you want to know how serious, ask Shelly.  They're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules.  You fuck them, you've got to do it right.
What time did you say they would be there?
I'm just asking, what if?
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it.  You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.
I'm still here.
Done.  We go now.
And what if I couldn't do that?
I'm going to Paris.
What do you mean?
What do they want me to do?
Are you Treadstone?
I don't know.
They're right about you, aren't they?  You're fried.  You really don't know what's going on, do you?
<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
...yes -- oui -- uh...

D'accord...  Merci.  Un moment -- un moment --
You call about Monsieur Kane?  John Michael Kane?
Yes.
Well...  I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really -- I was quite -- I was surprised.
Really.
I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
Jesus...
So what's in Paris?
Wait up --  -- just wait up --
I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?
What does that mean?
No.
Well, this is great.  I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
-- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it...  But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and...  I think something bad happened.
I don't know.
Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
This is your office?  God, you live like a monk...
All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
You stayed there five times in the past six months.  But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth--

Where did this body go?
Wait a minute --
Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
What?
Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
You drink rum?
... And then some.
Machines don't fix themselves.
...Yer nostril?
Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!
Well not exactly. But, if you help us we'll help you. The Forces Of Darkness have won the day ... but, tomorrow is another one
I know he would have wanted me to help you ... And I promised your mother I'd take you onto the team at information Retrieval. But I gather that ...
Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?!
Help me!
This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!
Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval ... I don't expect to see you slumming in Records - what's the problem?
What's the matter?
Even later.
Sorry about that ... Mr Helpmann told me you were coming aboard - congratulations!
Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
Yes, thanks.
No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake.
What has Tuttle done?
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
It could all be coincidental.
Jack, she's innocent!
Yes we have, Jack!
No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
Who are you? Let go!
I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn't I?
I didn't like it.
Where are you taking me?
What's going on here?
Suit me?
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
Look at that - right on time.
They'll be there waiting.
I thought you arrested me.
Cut it out, Sam.
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.
Don't you like parties?
Oh my God, a mistake!
It's not our mistake!
Oh, good!
It's your mother isn't it? Pulling strings again.
We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's cheque?
My husband's dead, isn't he?
Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?
My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
Numero huit, braised veal in wine sauce. 
Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me through to Mr Helpmann's office?
Have you got one or haven't you?
Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
Sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to work for Central Services?
You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong.
Is she dying?
It's okay, Kanita. Come on in.
Be cool, man. You're having a paradoxical reaction. It can happen.  Didn't I tell you this guy was stressed out?
Frank Pierce.
I know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. Terrible about her father, isn't it?
Dead.
No.
I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me.
What's his name?
You came out of the hospital. You were tied down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head, Noel. There's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that.
Sure, sure, give go.
What the hell.  The next year, tiebreaker for the division, in Boston, Yanks down two to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to the plate.
Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.
That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he?
He's dead, huh?
He's working a double shift.
Yes?
How is she?
Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.
He'll be all right.
No problem. Thanks for letting me crash. It was the best sleep I've had in months. I used some of your soap.
Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle?
Who's that?
Look at that. A fat junkie. That's a first.
You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.
We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.
Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
Last show of the night.
Tom, where are the Band-aids? This is an ambulance, isn't it?
I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
What do you want to break?
This guy's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks, ever since he got outta jail, wreaking general havoc, contributing to the bad name of the place. The term "menace to society" was made up for him.
He's crazy. He can't help it.
Get the kit! We're gonna tube him!
We're gonna save you, Noel. You're gonna be all right.  Do it, Tom! I'll call for fucking backup, I swear!
What?
Relax, it's a street job, easy except for the smell. We'll just throw him in back and zip over to Mercy--no blood, no dying, that's how I look at it. He's just a drunk.
And the rule was...
Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.
What?
No?
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
They didn't hire Peter Stiller from the <u>Times</u> and he had a great audition tape.
I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here.  Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our F-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.
Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
Because this is important -- so don't just be polite.  I'd really like to look...what's the word I'm looking for?...
Thanks, Jane.  Have a good time tonight.
You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
No.
Aaach...Jane...  Let's take the part that has nothing to do with me.  Let's let me be your most trusted friend, the one that gets to say awful things to you.  You know?
Yes, I guess.  Yes.
How?
Speaking.
Let's go...
Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
Yes.
You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
So who's the guy?
Oh, I was just writing you a note. What do you say we take a walk?
I understand.  I'll go with you.
They told me they'd keep me because they could plug me into any story and my salary was in line.
Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
I've got to tell Ernie...because there isn't enough time.
And Bobbie says...
We could...
Okay.  At least let me show my appreciation.  The Secretary of Labor is going to be indicted on Wednesday. For the graft thing he supposedly did before he was appointed.
Thanks a lot, Buddy.
I'll speak to you.
Why so glum?
Tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him.  Not near ready.  Not by the longest shot.  Aaron's spent six weeks in Tripoli, he's interviewed Gaddafi -- he reported on the Eight-one story.  I think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and I think it's my responsibility to tell you that.
I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.
I kept thinking what a great break it was for me to get to see you tonight.  More than a great break, maybe just what I needed...just when I needed it...Angel of mercy -- godsend...lifesaver...what?
Another thing I can't stand is ...when White House reporters bullshit with each other after a briefing and then one of them has a theory and the other quotes it in his story as "White House" sources say...
That actually goes on...
But that didn't stop me from sending out audition tapes to bigger stations and the networks.
I never told you the reason I was telling you everything for.
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.
You're an amazing woman.  What a feeling having you inside my head.
Yeah?
Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.
I'm not sure I dialed right -- Jane?
What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.
Why, you need me for the story?
Who?
That's not it.
What happened?
Yes.
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?
Go ahead -- what?
Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.
Where's the bathroom?
I converted a bedroom -- this stuff builds up.  Wait till you've been doing this sixteen years.
I'm sorry.
Yes, I'm sorry.
Don't be silly.  What are you sorry about?
Would you like to do me?
That's not true I am a sculptor!
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?
Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
Tonight.
Not even a little bit?
When's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room...
What the hell's going on?
It's a...full length life-size figure!
Let's see it.
These guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes.
May I please have another little kiss?
Are you ready?
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
You think I'm creative?
Walter...  I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  You know what I mean?
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
Would you really like to?  That would make me very happy.
Walter...stay away from me!
Maybe so...
No.  Why don't you cover it up Walter...
It will take years to make that many statues.  But your work would be featured.
Now what kind of statue was that?
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
Well I was uh, just looking...
What is it, your laundry?
No, it's Ok...you came in early.  Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything.
Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
I don't know, it just happened, I guess.  I didn't mean to.
Hello Leonard!  Beautiful morning, isn't it?
Walter...Walter listen carefully.  I don't want you to make any more statues.  Do you understand? No more statues.
When Carla comes by I'll talk to her.  She'll make up some nice invitations.  We'll have them printed up.
How ya doin'?
I didn't do nothing wrong!  That was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her for it.  I don't know about any -
Don't give me a hard time Walter! You don't want to get me mad!  You're coming with me!
You're gonna shoot me!
And what project looms on the horizon, Walter?
I thought you didn't respect money!
Walter, you did something to me with your work tonight.
T-turned on?
Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
Don't tell me I didn't hear a racket!  I'm an older woman and I don't need to be upset and disturbed in this manner!
Nice to feel needed.
Buffy!  Looking tasty.
Come on, come on, fork up the scub.
Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'.  You know, and a picture of the earth.
He doesn't look fifty.
You okay?
Something like that.
It's the news, Buffy.
I do?  I guess I do.
You broke up with my machine?
I am a God!  A God!
I know.
Thanks.
Pike, I don't think you're up to this.
Who?
I been working on some stuff for you.  What'cha doing?
In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?
I'm going out the front.
We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.
I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty interesting.
) What do you think?
Why don't we see a movie?
Beverly Center.
Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
I forgot.
Yeah, whoops I came.
You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
Everybody does.
In Virginia.
I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
We'll cover it later.
All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?
No -- you don't have to --
Oh, what the hell is wrong with you?  You threw a knife at my head!
I had to test you.
Put your head back.
Five.
I'm curious, is all.
Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready.
You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
Come one, that was so weird.
-- like she's gonna kill me.
Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come.
Hi.
My parents have money...
Write that down.
Omniplex?
What happened?
Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
The don't.  You kind of wish they would, though.
Oh, God.
Environment.  That's cool with me.
Buffy, the ape-woman.
Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever.  Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.
What?
They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.
You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.
My right nostril?
How ya like that?
I can't keep up with you.  First you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher--now no sex is gonna do it?!
Just till I lose.
No.
No, no, it was great.
What'd he say?
You didn't get "lured".  Women never get lured.  They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it--"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
Well let's get down to it, honey-- how was he?
And he's right!  A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often.  You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties--then you are!  And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit.
I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
I doubt that.
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?
Why not?
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
Yeah...you a witch?
You'd be great, just great...  'Cause you understand non-linear thinking even though it seems like baseball is a linear game 'cause of the lines and the box scores an'  all--but the fact is that there's a spacious-"non-time kind of time" to it...
Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings.
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.
No!  I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!
You missed the tag!
I didn't spit on you!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Drive off your back leg.  You pitch with your legs as much as your arms-
Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?
'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.
You got a Hall of Fame arm but you're pissing it away.
Can I ask you something?
What?
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
I was playing naked.
Hey, I'm cruisin', man--what're you doing out here?!
It's time you started working on your interviews.
"...Good Lord willing, things'll work out."
Club's expanding its roster to finish the season--
I'm trying to thank you.
Settle what?
C'mon, we got nothin' to fight about.
Fear and ignorance.
I don't need a crazy woman in my life.
Crash Davis?
Pussy.
I'd kill ya.
Throw it.  C'mon, right in the chest.
No way.
She's playing with my mind.
We'll pray anyway.
Patkin was a tribute to baseball...
Jesus--what's got into Nuke?
It's a damn convention.
I'm Nuke LaLoosh.  With the Bulls.
He goes to a whorehouse every night?
So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.
Hey, I need a room. Need a room.
I was never - I was never your guest at the Tangiers.
That's right.
The only time I was at the Tangiers was when I had dinner with Barney Greenstein.
Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
You were wandering around.
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from -
Watch it, partner, watch it!
No, you're not calm.
No, it's - it'll just be a couple of minutes. We got other things to do too, you know. He'll hurry her up. How's everything else besides this?
Wait, hold on a second.
You fuckin' piece of shit.
Hello.
Lester...
...listen to me very carefully. I want to talk to Ginger. I want my kid back. I want her put on a plane immediately.
No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
I can't! I'm tied!
Dad!
But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already.
Why, somebody's complaining?
I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?
Nope, there's no way.
The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
I see you, you motherfuckers.
...on the line and this guy's out havin' the time of his life. He has every cop in the state watchin' him, and he's out playin' golf.
What - what, Caesar's?
What are you doin'? You gotta get out of here!
I know. Why didn't you come to me? I mean, this is family, it ain't business. Meanwhile, you make calls back home. Sammy, it makes us look bad out here, you know what I mean? Back and forth, this one and that one, and, in the meantime, she's gone anyway. Am I right?
She didn't know who to turn to.  She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage.
Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
Mr Rothstein...  I'm Pat Webb.
Hey, it is my pleasure.
Uh, I come here personally to kind of smooth over a fracas about a certain matter. See, uh, maybe you didn't know it, but, uh, Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town. He's got lots of friends here. Now, his family and their money go back many, many years. Now, friends vote... family and money votes. That's important to me... and you. And if you'll think about our little problem along them lines...  and you forgive me for sayin' it, maybe he did not deserve to be fired.
Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill?
Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
...trying to offer you the respect that your...
L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
Ginger's mission in life was money.
I'll be right back.
Okay, thank you for asking.
Thank you.
...she took care of the valet parkers, the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.
Understand?  I'm sorry.
You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
Yeah.
You're so wonderful. The jewelry's not so bad, either.
Now look,  pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.
Well, what's the difference? I just need it.
Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that?
You can trust me.
I was just tryin' to help him. It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy!
What? What?!
Okay.
I don't need one.
...please. That's all I'm askin' you.
Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself.
What about the money? Uh, where's the box?
It's under...
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days?  I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.
All right... I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.
Who were you with?
What if he won't stop?
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.
You listen carefully! You ever fuckin' touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, I'll fuckin' kill you.  Pure and simple. Do you hear me? Pure and fuckin' simple, I'll fuckin' kill you, you bitch.
Get - Get up! Get up!
Should I let her in like - ?
After all the threats and all the bullshit, it turned out Ginger didn't tell 'em anything. But by then, the Feds didn't need her, anyway.
But it was just mine.
Yeah, thanks for not callin' me a liar. You son-of-a-bitch. You son-of- a
How many kids do you have?
Well...
So, you're a righty?
Look what they did to my hand, man!
You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
...I got muscled on the street.
Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
You can't talk to me like...
Mrs Ro- Mrs Rothstein! Okay, shh!
Um, I'm gonna need a bag. If you could just ask the guy for a big bag, okay?
And here. Here.
No, you can, you can.  You've been so nice to me.
Pitch-black?! It -
Carmine left?
Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh? 
For what?
What?
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
I know.
You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem.
I understand.
I'll be right out.
Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.
Tell me.
Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried.
All right?
You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do.
Okay.
You know?
He's so fuckin' lucky. I could have buried him. I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby. And then he'd've tracked me down and he'd've killed me.
Come on. Don't be scared.
Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole!
Get the fuck out of here.
Yes!
What money? I've seen you stealing from me.
All right.
Where are you goin'? Where are you? You're in that place. Where are you?
No, you're not. Where are you? Where are you?
So, it's gonna be okay, isn't it?
He called you right here.
It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know.
Just knock it off! Would you two knock it off? Get in the car.
- back to  Nigeria.  Yeah.
There's more!
How many of these you gonna eat, huh?
Two.
I took care of everybody.
I mean, the cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck. I mean, you know, they all worked it out together.
But, hey, what do they care, as long as I keep sendin' money back.
It's up to you.
Let's get out of here.
Yeah, what's to stop him?
And when I'm ready, I'll say the words, 'Go see the Jew.'
Calm down, calm down. Shh!
Get out. Get out! Get out!
You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.
How you doin'?
Since when do you talk like that?
I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
Hiya. That's a lot of money to be counting out in public.
No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
I'll bet. Funny, for some reason, I don't think dogs are supposed to like me.
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
You've lost all motor functions. The poison will kill you in ten minutes.
Catwomen. Lots of them!
What do you want from me?
Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
I'm supposed to be taking personality tips from you three?  You people were once heroes. You had ideals.  You fought for things.  Spooky told me so...
I don't want to hurt you, Catwoman. Yet.  After tomorrow, you can do anything you want, but please, just stay out of sight for the next 24 hours. I won't stand by and watch my leader get all emotional over an animal like you. I warn you, don't tempt Captain God when he is angry. Let is complete our mission in peace.
Oh Frank, I'm not anti-male, I'm anti- you. Believe me, there's a difference.  Kelly is designing new uniforms for next week. Pay her and thank her. And is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning.  There's something out there called 73 degrees, look into it.
What if I were to say "Your Wife"-- as in does she know of your touching mentor-student relationship with the post-Bicentennial babe working the roulette wheel?
I don't know what came over me.
Sorry, I get carried away. Once I become interested in someone, I can't stop trying to figure them out...Amnesia victims are challenging..
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
You turned around!
About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender.  Okay, I can't stand it anymore, I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night?
We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina?
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
Is every single thing out of your mouth since your "accident" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?
What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"
Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
Nice breasts.
Was someone in an accident?
Don't you have children?
Will you two cut it out?
I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.
Let's have your license, mister.
How do we get back to the freeway?
That was definitely out of line and totally unprovoked.  I heard you were a hitter.
If you know that just back off.
I improved on the fucking original.
Got your badge?
No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
Will you let me explain!
I don't want to know --
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
I realize you don't want to be involved.
Well isn't there a number on the goddam phone?
Okay.  The police are gonna need your full name and address.
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
I'm in traffic.  There's no place to turn.
What are you doing now?
She's gone --
He's copying down my license -- for all the good it'll do him.
Wait just a minute.  Our luck has changed.
If it's the tall man -- he had one of those hair transplants.  Tufts, you know.  It still hasn't grown fully in.  The other one is from the islands.  Braided hair -- very dark.
It won't be him.
Did you hear that click?
Thank you.  God bless you for helping us.
Your husband?
Yes.
Lenore -- you promised you'd follow instructions.  We're almost there.  Simply get out when they slide the van open and walk to me.
I'm not leaving my daughter behind.  Not with them.
They tortured us.  And you're going to let them have all that money?
For Christ sakes don't point it at me.  We want to get Rachel out of there in one piece.  I'm waiting for the girl.  Her mother wants to talk to her.
Jack Oberfeld in person.  Did you kill him?
At least one.
He seems to think he's entitled to it all.
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
You wouldn't --
Stop talking like that!
I'm still okay.
He wants 75 back.
Any idea where you're going?
What's really on your wicked little mind?
Sure, like I'm gonna take advice from you.
You can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land Jack there in federal prison.  He can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence.
I want you all in one vehicle. Your van.  If I see anybody else cruising around I'll keep going. No second chances.  You can kill them and I'll keep what I've got.
Some loyalty.
Satisfied?
I still don't see you.
Don't worry.
If he pulls me over he gets all the proceeds plus Lenore here.
The fuck I will!
You want us to get ourselves killed?
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
Yeah?
In the hills above Sunset.  Just below the Getty.
And make ourselves a hell of a target.
Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away.  In which case you just warned them.
There's no lady here.
What kind of Treasury Dept. business is this?
So can we consider you a regular, sir?
What you think?
What do you think his name is?
That's what he said. Jimmy.
See, they get the wrong idea.
Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt.
Take your clothes.
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Don't chuck my clothes out!
What's that supposed to mean?
No.
The accent, I suppose.
And what's it like?
What was that?
You all right?
He wants me to perform for him.
They're jealous.
Jesus Christ!
How different?
Is this an obsession of yours?
Aha.
I'm wondering why you keep his things.
Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?
No...
Come on, Dil --
Never let the sun go down on an argument, Jody used to say.
What you doing here?
Sorry, darling.
See, I was always best looking after someone. Must be something in the genes.
Must be.
My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.
You think that's wise?
Know what, honey?
Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that.
That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he?
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
You gonna tell me why?
Why?
I was trying to get out of something.
You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil.
Lifted him from a carnival in Belfast. Held him hostage for three days.
You killed my Jody?
Stop it, Dil --
Never.
Sorry, love. Now, the white ones are magnesium supplement --
Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
Don't go looking for it, Dil.
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.
Did you give him it?
Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.
He's all right.
You don't know that.
I know.
What do you mean?
No way, Jude. I'm out.
Leave her out of this.
And then you'll leave her out of it?
And what if you don't?
You may be right.
Who's the old geezer?
You sure?
It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all.
You sure about that?
I'm sure.
Right.
Right.
Fuck you.
What is it now?
Why can't we?
Only that you're all tough undeluded motherfuckers. And that it's not in your nature to let me go.
She's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit you.
Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man.
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.
Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus. Will you think of her too?
Don't know her.
How can I?
Like the one about the frog?
You stupid bastard --
I never know nothing.
I said shut the fuck up --
You're crazy --
Where are you, ol' buddy?
-- there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do. I want to know what it is.
It's simple. I like what I do -- I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time.
I could eat a horse.
You don't look so bad in this light.
Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
When you come on, you really come on.
Electric razor -- comb -- steamship ticket -- fountain pen -- four passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --  key -- what about that?
I love you, Adam.
I think it only said where -- but I can't --
That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- it's got to be something around here.
Agent.
Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
Very sweet.
Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.
But it's Charles's money, not theirs.
Then whose is it? His or theirs?
But --
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Bartholomew?
There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
Yes -- and he was there, too -- a little fatter now -- and less hair -- but it's the same one.
The lunch hour. He probably worked it out in advance. He found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here.
Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
Brian.
Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
And stop threatening that boy. He doesn't have the money. Mrs. Lampert doesn't either.
Reggie?
The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that.
Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?
Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.
There, you said it.
The phone's ringing --
Maybe.
Why?
Got you.
Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.
I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
How can I believe it when you don't even know who the killer is? I've got that right, haven't I? You don't know who did it.
No -- not yet.
I don't understand you at all -- one minute you're chasing me around the shower room and the next you're accusing me of murder.
I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful?
Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty.
What for? If it's not here, why bother him?
Yes.
Swiss.
He didn't have one.
Did you?
But he is gone.
Oh, forgive me.  Is this yours?
Doing what?
Hallo, Peter.
What was all that?
Look, I know it's asking you to stretch your imagination, but can't you pretend for a moment that I'm a woman and that you're a --
How would you like a spanking?
How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
Nothing. Good night.
That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
Yes?
You know what I want, Miz Lampert...
I'm glad. But what's all this?
Yeah? What's that?
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
You do?
I never fucked Rod.
I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.
IT'S LISA SHERMAN. But she still looks like we're eighteen.
You said that two weeks ago.
Hi honey.
I'm fine. I've just never had someone my age die before. It's so weird.
I want you to head right home after school.
I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
Are you sure?
She works at a church?
Daddy....
_ Your father raped someone?
No! That's his table.
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him.
Oh nice save.
He says he loves me.
Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
You know I want to go with you.
Hi princess.
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
Why not?
Yes.
Yeah.
Ok.
Hide your laptop here.
No.

 Oh...


...and fair...
...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over  the mountain.
Aw!  Oh, Jesus.
...and a shitload of ice.
Look, if I don't get this stuff to McGruder, it's goodbye, Andy's Ice Cream, goodbye, Jerome, goodbye, Mon-...
I need your help.
You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my...
I need your truck!
Would you hurry up, please?
There we go.  There we go.  Did you keep it safe?  Did you 
...town. 
I ain't goin' through Missoula!
I did not steal this truck!
Oh, shit.
...gun?!
Hey, take a look at your situation and...
...-er!
...you stole the truck to uphold your principles, right?
Holy shit...
...man!
...up!
Fuck! 
...Shift.
...do we?
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
 Oh...
...Pete.  Come on.
...you crazy bastard.
Ho, ho...
 Oh...
Okay.

Taking it down the hill.

Oh, no!

...did you?
I deserve a lot more than that truck! Ten years, ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard.
So you took his...
...truck.
You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State.
How wonderful for you.
Yeah, Robert Del Rio.
We were celebrating right after the draft, going from bar to bar.  I was drivin'.
We got two paddles.
To tell you the truth, you didn't.
...miles.
I think you oughta cut a...
 ...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt...
...man.

They're takin' off.
Hey, hey, hey.
What?
Oh, fuck!
Stupid.

Well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway!
 There's gotta be...
Hold this. 
Why'd you stay behind?!
We're the shit.  Bigtime.
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
 Yeah.
Thank you very much.
What about all that "no need to get in the man's...
...-tiatin'.

Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls.
Yeah.
 big balls.
You-You can't let him...
 ...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.
...-lem too?
We do have to take into consideration that, through your courage...
...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
However, you are also non-en-...
...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...
Looks like it.  Yes, sir.
What the hell is all this about a detonation today?  We're scheduled...
I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
You look fit...healthy...
Oh, I'm well aware of what the government did, I assure you.  Actually, I've just come to say how grateful I am to you...
...men every time I've closed my eyes?  But after you went away, I--
So far, ye-yes.
Hit him again.

Shit.
Having witnessed the effects myself, I can assure you it'll be very useful when the bidding starts.
Get 'em in the  middle of the dam.
...in Missoula.  All we need to do is get to Mason before anyone else does.
...-ty.
Hemmings!  Sam, I thought I told you to close up shop and be ready to move up the island by night-...
...noon.
You don't think it's that bad, do you, sir?  I mean, Long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant.  The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.
Iced coffee.
Assumptions are always...
Uh, you wanna hunt outta season, it's cool with me.  But mostly, well, they just take a six...
...and a rifle.  You, on the other hand...
Where's Arlo?


Where's Elvis?!
 ...checked. 


...-son.  Of all the days for you to show up late.  First, the idiot April calls in sick.  Then I got a bad tooth...
...it.
Oh, no?
Go.
...we're gonna seal that tunnel!  I want it air-...
Sir, we can't just let him get away with this!

The sooner you get up the lab, the sooner you'll figure it out.
What the hell are you talkin' about...
Morning, doc.  Awful early, aren't ya?
There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.
...is a perfect hunter.
...back...
Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
Mr. Sweeney, how goes it?
 I don't know.  Um, he's working, but there's a lot of data. Maybe...another hour?
I got eight thousand yards. Radius is five...
Mason.  Mason!
You find yourself wearing a...
...beer.
You redneck idiot, do you have...
...on the other end of this phone.
...side!
 Wait.  Listen to me, Pappas.  If you don't let us by...
I'll lead 'em out.

Look at that.
Can I check one of these volumes out?
We worked in Chinatown together.
Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.
His girlfriend?
Yes, his girlfriend.
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
Just find the girl.
Well, you don't look any the worse for wear, Mr. Gittes, I must say... where's the girl?...
I'd like you to look at something, Mr. Cross.
Haven't the faintest idea.
How do you do that?
The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
Of course I do. Where are you?
You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought.
They don't kill a guy for that.
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
Sure thing.
Curly, where's your car?
Could you drive me somewhere?
Sure, as soon as we eat.
Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.
Plus what I owe you?
Hello, Jake.
You've done well by yourself.
You're behind the times, Jake. They've got steam irons now.  And I'm out of Chinatown.
Oh yes.
No. It was an accident.
Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
What pictures?
This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.
Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered.
I heard it was an accident.
Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
And why's that?
I know what he says.
I don't suppose you got any idea Where she went?
She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down for you.
Give you three minutes.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.
Who is he, get his name? I'll kill him.
No.
Not that Mulwray?
Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando.
Well, how much would you like?
Well, I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair.
My husband.
I don't like the word 'cheat.'
For very long?
Yes... why?
You must've had a reason to ask me that.
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.
What dam?
Know him?
...No. Why was it.
What's wrong?
It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
You won't go to the police if I tell you?
Did you get some sleep?
Sure.
Going somewhere?
You're going to miss your train!  Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.
...he had a breakdown... the dam broke... my mother died... he became a little boy... I was fifteen... he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, what clothes to wear!... It happened... then I ran away...
You can't go by train. Escobar'll be looking for you everywhere.
How do you know?
Sophie, go to the little girl's room for a minute.
Where'd he go yesterday?
Three reservoirs. Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower, and the Pig 'n Whistle.
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
And Mulwray isn't?
He never even kids about it.
You don't happen to know where Mr. Mulwray's having lunch?
Jake, what're you doin' here?
Yeah? Ain't that something? Middle of a drought, the water commissioner drowns. Only in L.A.
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
Gittes.
May I ask what this is regarding?
Gee whiz.  And I'm late.
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
Julian Cross worked for the water department?
This?
All she needed for that was the phone book!
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
You don't say?
Now listen to what I've got to say. I took up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren't these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down' boom! Everything would go up in flames!
Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed.  When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?...You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am. 
But...who...
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
I don't remember him any more—Ma, where's Russia?
Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.
So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh?  Especially the new papers -
You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand.
Do you, Mr. Leland?
What's the matter?
Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to Europe with him?  He wanted you to.  He said to me just yesterday -
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon.  Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter.  And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead.
And the notice?
The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, I should be only too glad -  I shall be here in the morning.
I'm sure that's it. 
I know it is, Brad -
Here I am, darling...  Darling!... Darling, it's all right...  Mother's here.
Oh!!
You're no Venus de Milo.
I'm sorry.  They live here, too?
You really don't know who I am?
But you like me, don't you?  Even though you don't know who I am?
You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and - 
Yes, I would.  That's why I asked.
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
Charlie!  I said, what time is it?
I mean in New York.
Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!
What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that -
Susan, it seems to me -
No, you're not.
Don't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this? That you've packed your bags and ordered the car and -
It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent - in which I concur - that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people.  You are not, I hope, suggesting that these interests are not indentical?
But, it is impossible.  I will be the laughingstock of the musical world!  People will say -
"Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast."  You know you haven't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the Jersey Coast.
They're all part of your general attack - your senseless attack - on everything and everybody who's got more than ten cents in his pocket. They're -
Raymond - 
Do you know what that is?
It's been a tough day.
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
I mean I've got a job for you.
You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
I don't have to.  I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece.  I've got to think of her.
That's all right.  What are you going to do about Emily?
Hello, Brad.
Maybe you could remember something that -
Sure, Mr. Leland.  I'll be glad to.
Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to handle the old man.  He was kind of queer, but I knew how to handle him.
Queer?
How did you meet him?
I didn't get a thing.  Just the music lessons.  That's all there was to it.
I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?
Am I sure?
I'd say you're about nineteen, twenty, am I right?
Well, if it's already too late...
Jesus!
Fifty-five.
No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
Can I watch?
Can I use the bathroom?
Why aren't there any lights?
Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
Such a sordid state of affair.
He was?
Nobody! I swear!
You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend.
Well... kind of, sort of?
Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
And you came here to what? To comfort me?
Sang? His name is a past tense?
There's more, isn't there?
Let me take you out tonight.
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang.
How'd you get here so fast?
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
There's a strange man in our bathroom, and he just raped Caitlin!
What about Caitlin?
All right, now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight, then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent.
So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
You're late.
Want something to drink? I'm buying.
Five years.
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
She called me Brad.
She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.
No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?
So when they blew it up, no prob. Evil is punished.
You'll never believe what this unruly customer just said...
What's he looking for?
Nudie booth?
What kind of show?
Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.
I know.
Design major.
We're not playing in the street.
What happened to all the Gatorade?
You know what Sanford told me? 
Yeah, right.
Oh, my god.
What!?
True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.
I can't close the store.
You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
Broke his neck.
Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
Because I never tried to suck my own dick?
My cousin? My aunt found him. On his bed, doubled over himself with his legs on top. Dick in his mouth. My aunt freaked out. It was a mess.
Balls resting on his lips.
I could never reach.
You know.
If you must.
You know what? I don't think I care for your rationale.
If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence, even though I'm a clerk in this video store, I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice.  Agreed?
Five hundred dollars.
As opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here.
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
What happened to title dictates behavior?
Who eats cock?
I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
That's all bullshit. You know what the real problem here is?
I'm talking about this thing you have... this inability to improve your situation in life.
What responsibility?
...If I wasn't such a fucking coward.  It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.
You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.
Jesus H. Christ, I can't!
So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change?
My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.
Lovely story.
How do you figure?
Like ten after.
Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
I still remember Caitlin telling us about that time you two went to that motel-the one with the mirrors and the hot tub in the room.
Excuse me?
How much can you bench?
Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?
No, she's getting married.
What? When? When did all this shit happen?
Are there any balls down there?!
One seventy-nine.
He died in the bathroom.
Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
Oh... Can I help you?
Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler.
The white kind.
Say, young fella, you know I hate to bother you again, but can I take a paper or something back there... to read?  It usually takes me a while, and I like to read while it's going on.
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
You're trusting.
We might have; I don't remember. How many?
Including you?
You've only had sex with three different people?
I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
You sucked his dick!
We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around.
Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
Something like thirty-six.
I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
...And one of those guys was you! The last one, I might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that I've been faithful to you since we met! All the other guys I went with before I met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead!  But don't look at me like I'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me!
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.
A couple...?
Were you working here at about four o'clock?
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
That doesn't sound metal.
Did he say "making fuck?"
What part of Russia?
Is he staying here?
Come on, man, "Berserker!"
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
You hope what feels good?
Well this is the last time I ever rent here...
He didn't ask me to...
Dental School.
No, I transferred into Monmouth this year. I was tired of missing him. 
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
I copy.
Where are you, Walker?
Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
How's your leg? I'll live.  Where'd you leave Jessie?
I'm going with you.
Take the gun.
Sure you can.
There you go.
Use your other hand!  Grab it!
I know...
Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
Listen to you...  The old "mouth-to-mouth" resuscitation routine, huh?
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
Where?
He doesn't want my help.
He can handle it.
I can't believe you just said that.
Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?
Nice view, huh?
What was God thinking when he built this place?
They'll kill him!  He has no idea!
Don't let me fall!
We don't have time to argue about it!
I won't do it.  No way.
Take the rope.
The "old mouth to mouth" resuscitation routine.
Never could save a thing.
Where's the helicopter?
He'll freeze.
Talk.  No tricks, no codes, no messages.  You haven't found us. It was a fake call.
Souvenirs?  No, wrong answer. Looks like your friend plans on hanging around, that possible?
Yeah...
On top of the peak.
He asked you, how far?!  I think you've been taking the scenic route.  How far from here?
Then where the fuck is!
Right.
Why?  What are you going to do?!
Man against nature, right Travers.
Jessie?  Looks like your friend found company.
Good, Travers.  It might catch on, like shooting skeet.
We've got a full crew, but we can squeeze one more, right.
Appreciate it.
... used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing.
But, missus, this is an emergency. It's a matter of life and death. Me friend's lying in the middle of the road bleeding to death.
I... I'm very sorry, but I never open. I'm very sorry but I never open the door to strangers after dark.
Now listen here, you little bastard, just you turn around and walk out of here the same way as you came in. Alex eyes a giant white, fibreglass phallic sculpture on the table beside him.
Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
Fine, sir, fine.
Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.
Alex.
Wrong? Why should you think of anything being wrong, have you been doing something you shouldn't. Yes? He shakes Alex's hair.
Because next time it's going to be the barry place and all my work ruined. If you've no respect for your horrible self, you at least might have some for me who'se sweated over you. He slaps Alex on the knee.
You try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. This is some new form of torture. Say it, brother, sir.
It's alright, thank you.
I beg your pardon?
Not tonight - not this nochy.
She came towards me with the light like it was the like light of heavenly grace, and the first thing that flashed into my gulliver was that I would like to have her right down there on the floor with the old in-out, real savage. But quick as a shot came the sickness, like a detective that had been watching around the corner and now followed to make his arrest. Alex retching. Minister rises.
Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?
I can tell you that I... and the Government of which I am a member are deeply sorry about this, my boy. Deeply sorry. We tried to help you. We followed recommendations had been made to us that turned out to be wrong. An enquiry will place the responsibility where it belongs. We want you to regard us as friends. We've put you right, you're the best of treatments. We never wished you harm, but there are some that did and do, and I think you know who those are. There are certain people who wanted to use you for political ends. People who would have been glad to have you dead because then they would have been able to blame it all on the Government. I think you know who those are. There is also a certain man - a writer of subversive literature - who has been howling for your blood. He's been mad with desire to stick a knife into you, but you're safe from him now, we've put him away. He found out that you had done wrong to him - at least he believed you had done wrong. He had formed this idea in his head that you h
What job and how much?
As an unmuddied lake, Fred. As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, Fred.
One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between two friends.
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.
Well. That was all took away, son, by the Police. New regulation about compensation for the victim.
Oh. Oh, you're sorry are you, well you must think I'm awfully stupid. He slaps Alex in the face.
Yes sir.
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
One half bar of chocolate. One bunch of keys on white metal ring. One packet of cigarettes. Two plastic ball pens - one black, one red. One pocket comb - black plastic. One address book - imitation red leather. One ten penny piece. One white metal wristlet watch, "Timawrist" on a white metal expanding bracelet. Anything else in your pockets?
Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
Through there for a bath.
Yes!!!
How are you feeling today?
Fine. Fine.
Just part of hospital routine.
No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
Yes. Yes, well don't think about it too long, just say the first thing that pops into your mind.
I hope so. Is that the end then?
Be patient, my son, and put your trust in the Lord.
One pair of underpants - white with blue waistband.
Well, it's a surprise all right, a bit bewildering too.
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
We taking bets?  What if you're wrong?
If this is a joke, it's not funny.
Come on, it's been a long, shitty day. How about a break?  I'll call a tow truck myself, I swear.  I won't budge from this spot.
Right through those doors.  The man himself.
Remember what you played?
Lay it on me.
What?
Federal?
The fat man on Cherry Street.  The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer.  The trumpet player.  That leaves two.
So?
Cabbie drove around all night.  Three people got killed.
Oh?
Elvis?
Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.
It's nothing.
What's your name?
I'm standing right here.
I came to see you, you look fine.  We gotta go.
We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
Yeah?
...everything is not about me, don't make me the villain here.  That asshole was out of line, and you goddamn well know it...
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...
First time in New York?
Third, but I still can't tell uptown from downtown.  Tell the truth, whenever I'm here, I can't wait to leave.  Place gets to me.  Too loud, too fast...too much.  You like it here?
It's home.
Two, two-fifty.
You're cool.
I'm gonna roll him off the hood. Always lift with your legs...
I don't think I can do this.
Max.
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
What about that?
I'm making <u>you</u> nervous.  I'm the one with a schedule.
58th and Central.  You know it?
They're <u>somebody's</u> friends...  You drive a cab.  I kill people.  We both do our jobs right, you might survive the night and come out four hundred bucks ahead.
What do you care?  Ever hear of Rwanda?
Rwanda-Burundi.  Central Africa.
Hands on the wheel.  Ten and two o'clock, like they taught you in driver's ed.
I listen to classical.
That what we're doing?  Flowing?
What, no insurance?
Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
You had to kill Heller?!
That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.
You're too good.  We're in this together.  Fates intertwined.  Cosmic coincidence and all that crap...
And you believe me...?
Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said:  "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you"...they'd have to kill you...  'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone...  To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life...  Do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  Open your eyes in the morning?  I don't think you do...I don't think so...  I think you are way <u>low</u>...like in your estimation.  In your estimation of yourself.  So how'd you get that way...?
Answer the question.
None of your business.
'Cause I never got it straightened up; made the push, made the moves...
It's a man without a nose you want, you dumb complicit sons of bitches!  You've got to listen to me.
You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
You saved my life.
Lucky guess... Um, I'd feel a lot less naked if we could get outta here.
What took so long?  You were in there all day.
You want something to drink?
Pretty scary, huh?
Who?
Was that who I thought it was?
I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?
Is he dead?
How'd he die?
You run with your back to the picture.  Like you were trying to get away.  Once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself.
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
Well, I've been tracking them down all morning.
There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot?  Harriman Tower. Their sub-basement was flooded! He didn't die in a pool.  Call the coroner in Rhode Island!  Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!
You look great.
Now what?
My father's house.
That's the last time you rode, isn't it?  Do you think it was your fault?  Is that why?
They'll trace it.
Blue moon... Blue moon...
Liza?
Don't die on me, Jerry.  Okay?
What's that?
I'm not sure what you mean.
I'm leaning toward no.
We got someone watching her 24 hours a day.  She --
Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
We experimented with hallucinogens.  We used electro- shock to produce a vegetative state.  We conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation.
If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
Belief is immaterial.  What's important is the truth... It's been my job to find Jerry.  I'm very much responsible for him.
If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live.  Why are you telling me all this?
I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.
I want to believe you, too.
I'm going to find him.  Because he'd find me.
Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
What do you suggest?
Hope there's a cartoon.
Last week, about 3 A.M., Fish -- Dr. Fisher -- was on a late shift, and he found her doing laundry.
I'm willing to take that risk.
Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
I'm surprised you even knew it was an election year.
The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work?  Well, I do care.  Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not.
Goddamnit, they are out there, David --
... could it be a nested code of some sort?
Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.
What is it?  What's happened?
Do you have a minute -- ?
Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.
What does it say?
... And while its function remains, for the moment, a mystery, my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind.
What's the status of the decryption effort?
What?
Here, right around Centaurus A.
It's how I hear it.  The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.
This isn't a person to person call, Mr. Kitz.  I don't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for Americans.
Could we hear to China?
So.  Are you an hallucination?  Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?
We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
You always have been.  We're all descendants of the same stars, Ellie.  All made of the same primordial atoms.
You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
Very good, Doctor.  I've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something.
Very well.  Assume this is true. Assume they have only the best of intentions.  Suppose they decide to just step in and solve all our problems for us.  You have no objection to them so flagrantly intervening in human affairs?
I do.  More than anything.  But I am also a realist.  Soon this... what is your charming term -- ?  Dog and pony show will finally be over, and I will go home.
... Drumlin said you're been down at Arecibo for the last year.
'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
... I keep telling myself okay, that's just the price, you have to do your time doing shitwork before you're allowed to get to the good stuff... but if I have to catalog one more quasar...  God, I've missed you.
But what about your research -- ?
But the work --
It's really happening.
That you, Valerian?
... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years.  You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics.  It must have taken tremendous faith.
And you believe this law with all your heart and soul.
I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
Some of my best friends are scientists.  They're saying the machine is alive.
Something like that.
I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie.  I'm not 'out to get' technology.  I only ask the question:  Does it have to have all the answers?  I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.
I don't follow.
Do you really believe your life is meaningless?
I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
The final countdown.
You're trembling.
What...?
I can't do this --
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
I don't know.  Maybe we built the damn thing wrong.  Maybe it was all a hoax...  The safest thing would probably be to do a Chernobyl; encase it in concrete.
Git your shovel and git to work.
Buck is a deal.
Oh, I had me some high old times. Yore old man, Luke, wasn't much for stickin' around, but damn it he made me laugh.
You allus had good jobs, and that girl in Kentucky I taken a shine to her.
She took off with that convertible feller...
Yeah.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
Go hard!
Comin' out here, Boss?
Please! Please!
Had it done in Singapore. Bunch of us drunk as coots --
You can't do that!
But there's still daylight left.
Jus' take it slow, buddy.
What happened? How far did you get?
Dragline, lemme look at the picture.
That's my baby.
Well, whatta we got here?
Whatta you so happy about?
Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself.
They don't know iff'n to smile, spit or swallow.
Where'd the road go?
We got it locked in the sock.
Luke. Where you goin?
He peels the eggs himself. That's understood.
No more than five. For a cold drink.
Ace calls. Here we go.  King-five gets a tray for no help.  Paira ninas gets a Jack.  Ana man with the ace gets... slop in the face... Ninas up.
Kick a buck.
One, two, three... 
What did I do?
It's good medicine.
A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for.  <u>Forget</u> it.
Cellulite.  What do you say I blindfold you and take you to the gym.  Aerobics with housewives...
Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
What?  What'd I do?
Reminded me that I used to be attractive.  That men used to want me...
Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
Tell her we're sorry we bothered her.
The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects.
You said, first, he was lying.  How do you know that, Doctor?
Inspector Halloran.  Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?
Then you get your ass outta here, I don't wanta see you again...
Hi.  It's your worst student, Peter Foley -- how do you grade me now, Doctor?
What was that?  What am I hearing? The sound of an epiphany, a sudden blinding insight?
No.  Not yet.
Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take mine black.  You're absolutely correct.  The politicians don't want panic headlines spoiling the Festival of Love.
It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  Now, I've done what you asked me.
Maybe that's why you can't catch him.  I <u>know</u> what she looks like -- the red-headed woman in my computer.
She probably let him in the door without a thought.  Where are their mothers?!  Where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight?
We've got another one.
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.
Have you got a warrant?  Get the hell out o here!  This is the <u>only space I have left in the</u> <u>world</u>!  Why can't you leave me out of it?
That little Winona Ryder manner... you're more convincing as Clint Eastwood.
He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
They weren't going to show it to me?!  The arrogance!  It's my <u>life</u>!
'...great dark hall of fame... all our greatest killers...'  His greatest <u>heroes</u>?  He wants to be famous.  When they're caught and people like me write about them, we give them a kind of immortality. They get thousands of letters. Ramirez kills eight women and gets a hundred marriage proposals a month.  They're like film stars.
They're not talking to me.  Saks looks right through me.  I ask him for some bodies, for the phones -- he's so encouraging: "you make that <u>your</u> little job."  Condescending bastard.  Helen, on your lists to call is San Quentin.  Daryll Lee Cullum?
He felt sorry for me.  It was so nice to flirt.  He was a darling man.
Helen.  I saw him die.  I saw him burning on the basement stairs, he never reached the top.
Helen -- let go.  You've got to let go.
They all have one...
You touch anything, Mike?  Pick up anything?  Use the doorknob?  I don't want to find your prints on anything later and you tell me you forgot to tell me.
Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.
I heard. Good police work.
Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...
Classy madonna.
Nada.  Lemme make the call.
Honest to God, Ruben!
She didn't fight back, no hair or skin under her fingernails.  I'm not seeing any bruises or contusions...
I tagged the goddamned stocking. It ain't lost.  We're sequestering that evidence.  That's the trap some son of a bitch is going to fall into...
Am I in charge of this thing?  Or not.
We're gonna have a bunch of clapped out old hippies blissing on the Grateful Dead!  Sleeping in the park, smoking dope and sticking tulips up their ass.
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.
I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
Oh, maaaaan?!
So what have we got?
Okay, now what about your sidekick punching my favorite detective? What the hell is going on?  You got no discipline in your operation.
Where you going?
I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...
She's in no shape to give her statement tonight...
Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.
She doesn't lie!  You sure you fed her?
They consider this to be the airport hospital. This ward is reserved for air- crash victims. The beds are kept waiting.
Have you seen it?
I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months.
What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
I've never really noticed. Is Renata going with you?
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
It's much worse now. You noticed that, did you? The day I left the hospital I had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason I didn't understand. There seemed to be ten times as much traffic.
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
Please finish your story.
Hard to say.
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
What about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology? I thought that was your project.
Have you been in contact with the principal about your job?
Things have been kind of stressful lately.
What about this one?
Hi, Mom.
Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...
Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here.
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
Oh no.
Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
Yes.
Green spot.
If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so.
To talk?  Well, OK, that might be good.
Letty.
I answered these questions last night.
What are you looking to read?
For a price.
A small price.
No way.
I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
I have a terrible confession.
Not a one.
I like it.     But Headlines are better.
This must be Beast.
I bombed. It's either work in the office or nothing.
You're going to miss the Top Ten.
What do you mean not taking your meds?
Silly?   Silly am I?
Silly, silly, silly.
Don't upset my Mom.     Don't you upset my Mom.
Would that really be such a good idea for either of us?
My math program. The Superintendent said he'd fund it.
Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?
Especially now.
I had to smuggle it in here. I guess you're not really supposed to have jewelry.
So will you?
You what?
I don't mean to hurt you.    I know this is a terrible thing.    And I have really loved you.
Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
You killed her!
I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
They don't have a murder weapon?
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
What the fuck was all that about at the hotel last night? I thought we had a deal?
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
I thought you wanted Zammito?
Not today.   Where are your friends?
Jesus.   What kind of FBI agent are you?
No.
A million! I don't have that kind of money.
Good.   I'm good.
Okay. I understand you're interested in one of our properties?
I will relay the particulars of our conversation to Mr. Maranzano.
What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
What kind of business?
Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one.
Get that, will you?
Because you're the closest.
In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.
Do I?
This is Zero.
We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here.
Good idea.
It's not?
Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond.
If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
Maybe you should call the police.
He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
Yeah, French guys from France.
Okay boss.   Where are they?
You didn't say find them. You said, "get them."
Just find them!
Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.
No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
The Holiday Hotel.
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
I was told to take what we have and go.
They don't have a wine list.
What about transportation?
What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
No.   How much?
C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
No.
He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
I'm telling you that's my car!   And someone's gonna pay for it!
I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother.
No shit?
You ever hear of jet lag?
Did she break your heart?
No.
What are you doing?
Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!
She's crazy.  You should have killed her.
Yes.
And if I use them to kill you?
I'll never live as a thief!
You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain.  You know... you've gone as far as you can go.  I hid my skills so as not to hurt you.
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?
It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!
Sure.  No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?
I've missed you.
Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.  If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice.  You can run from marriage, but not your parents.
Where is he now?
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
Take my horse and go to the compound. Give this to Mrs. Wu.  She'll help you.  Hurry!
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.
When I was a boy, one night, I saw a thousand shooting stars.  I thought, where did they all go? I'm an orphan.  I used to look for stars alone.  I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert, I'd find them.  I've been riding in the desert ever since.
Your father's men are still looking for you.  They're still out there, circling closer.
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
Come with me to Peking.  You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself. It'll be just like old times.
Sir Te believes it's a ploy cast suspicion on Governor Yu.
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
No.
It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's.  Were you involved?
What do you mean?  Didn't you come back here for it?
My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone.  I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.
For her, they might make an exception.  If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
I thought by giving away the sword, I could escape the Giang Hu world. But the cycle of bloodshed continues.
I wish there were something more I could do to help you.
Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full of corruption... I tried sincerely to give it up but I have brought us only trouble.
My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.
Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts.  She's being so considerate.
A murderer?
Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.
They're gone.
No onions?
I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell.
You're welcome.
Do you feel okay.
No.
I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition.  It got a little rowdy... end of story.
And how many lives have you destroyed?
Neither.
What the hell are you?
Don't waste my time.
Coupla more rings... 24k.
Are you okay?
You what?
Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride?
That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
How do you know I've been with several women?
What? Another letter from your friend?
You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
I sincerely doubt it.
Thank you.
It was fine.
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
How about tonight?
That's also none of your business.
What are you reading?
Alone again.  What are you up to today?
What?
You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady.
That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person.
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
I do not.
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
Why are you doing this?
Because I'm in love with you.
Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.
Good for you.
Hi.
Would you like a tour?
Outstanding.
It's based on the life of Doctor Martin Luther King.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I'm in the bath, mom.
Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.
Really? Bulimic headcase.
No.
Something awful happened last night.
If that's what you call it.
I was just kidding.
And then I can go home?
Want a blow job?
I do.
Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
Yummy.
Oh baby... oh baby...
And you think she bought it?
I'm pretty sure she did.
She bought it.
Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.
I don't find this very funny,
Care to make a wager on that?
Even there?
I'm working on it.
Any day now.
Yippy.
Nothing.
If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her.  She made me laugh.
And that's why you're losing your bet?
She shot you down.
It clearly is why.
I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.
That's not fair. You're taking all the fun out of it.
Screening calls. Any suggestions?
I have a flair for drama.
Ronald?
To my triumph, of course.
Get off me!
Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
I think you have your answer.
I can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You've always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her.
It's Cecile.
It's desperate that I talk to her.
She's not here.
Nope.
I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
Ronald, e-mail's for geeks and pedophiles. Be romantic. Write her another letter.
Hey Ronald.
Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?
But it is a part of our lives too --a part of our past, It's a Goya reproduction. Those three cats --  are supposed to be the most beautifully drawn cats in Western art.
We don't even like them,  I've often thought of giving it away, but Oliver wouldn't stand for it.  It was his first wife's favorite picture.  She was an artist.
Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
But it's already come true.
Oh, thank you, darling.
My, my, what a coil we're in! What's this all about?
It's your play.
It's late, Mommy -- you haven't forgotten my birthday party.
Yes, daddy.
I didn't forget.
Certain wishes do.
Because you didn't ask them?  I don't blame them for being angry. Why didn't you explain what happened?
She's there, just like I said she'd be.
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
But there's no one here, darling.
Who are you?
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
You'll always play with me?
Can't you get it, darling?
This is more fun than just pretend.
There's an oak leaf.  Add a maple.
But we don't have any sea weed.
Your children?
Merry Christmas.
So beautiful, Irena. So beautiful.
It stands so still.
Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
Bad luck to see death in the snow.
I like stories.
Who's Herne the Huntsman?
I hate the storm. I hate it!
Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
Yes...yes, that's true.
You'd better hurry.  I've left Amy in the car and she's getting impatient.  She tells me there's something especially important about a sixth birthday.
Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
Waiter! She needs more water.
Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful.
It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
What else is there?
That bite healed up quickly. It's been about three weeks?
Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?
You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
Anything's better than Mark.
He's a very talented musician.
I wonder what it's like being you. Being noticed all the time.
He hasn't said one word to me.
Frida, I don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men.
Only to see.
Where are all the mediums?
You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.
You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
And then?
Are those Mark's?
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
I've been here. What day is it?
Tuesday. Are you okay?
Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
What happened to his tooth?
At least I finally saw the reason you couldn't get over Mark.
I think I just got my period.
Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
What choice do we have?
I think George knows.
You hungry?
Well, whattdaya think?
Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?
That's okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I'll leave.
Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
You think that story's gonna make me loan you money?
Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.
The Nielson's?
You busted me.
Silver bullets. A collectors item. These are very valuable. They were melted down from a crucifix.
What's wrong?
Uh.... hi!
No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "I love you too" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it.
Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
You know, I've never seen your cat.
Your breasts feel larger.
NO! Don't come over. Peter... I... I don't want to see you anymore. Ever.
Go away. I might hurt you.
Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
Here's a towel.
You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
I wonder how Frida and Carlton are getting along?
See he was cheating from the get go.
Nah, I don't wanna break up with Wanda, I just wanna see Carmen too.
Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?
That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?
Hey, there was a lot of blood.
Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
Seems he's stolen money from them. He's desperate and our only lead.
Thanks.  Just some pills.
His wife.
Jesus.  Small world.  Where's the photographer?
Iíll be the judge of that.  Anything else?
Iím your new assistant.
It seems fine.
Why are they after you?
They've taken my mind, my memories...
Such a joker!  Like your father.
You see it?
Yes.
I didn't realise...
Someoneís after me.
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
Your name is John White.
I cannot say...  You don't know the answer to that?
We are little more than a sum of memories.  From them we reference who we are, where we're going.  Without a past we are nothing.  This is why you are so interesting.
You've been working too hard.
It's a trick.
How much do you usually get paid?
Holy cow.
That shelter was in this bill.
Alan
You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
Oh... I'm fired?
Nightmare...
Don't call the Vice President!
Clean.
What about the wife?
Clean.
If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up.  Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months.  The whole thing is under control.
It's a homeless shelter.
Oh.  Excuse me.
When does it break?
Don't do this.
Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?
Thanks. You did great.  Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something.
Now, Dave, something has come up and I think we need to talk about it...
In fact, we think you did such a good job, we'd like to extend things a little bit.
You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around...
Right.  Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
... Somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal...'
Wrong...
Alan...
Now he's making stuff up about me.
You're spending forty-three million dollars on an ad campaign to...  'Boost consumer confidence in the American auto industry.'
Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
What's that?
The Vice-President...
Don't you have anything to say to me?
I'm not the First Lady, anymore.  I shouldn't be here.
Where are you going?
You sure this goes somewhere?
Hi.
) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?
All set.
Then why did you come here?
Quiet!
SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!
Bees. That's what we call the dead... the walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island.
What is it if it ain't a curse?
I can find it myself. I didn't come that far.
Datura.
How long do we have to watch him?
Ain't no place safe.
There ya go. Complete with air canisters...little motors.
I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.
You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done.
You can't run away from the planet, Miss Science. You can't even run away from the island, heh heh.
We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
No time for that. I'll take care of them.
Cameron, what is the matter with you. You act like they're your mother or something.  You afraid of them?
I don't know.  I don't get it.
It will?  How do you figure?
He flatters me so I'll help him with Latin.
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.
Do you still insist that this was your idea and your idea alone?
What happened? Were you kicked out?
Don't stop.
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
God, if Chet found out he'd...
We thought it would be good to break old habits, sir.
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.  The Latin term for that sentiment is "Carpe Diem." Anyone know what that means?
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
A sweaty-toothed madman
His grades are hurting, Charlie.
Father, I wasn't disputing you.
I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  Is that clear?  Is that clear!
Where is this cave he's talking about?
Why'd you leave Balincrest?
Well, you've won the booby prize.  Don't expect to like it here.
Want to come to the study group?
Keating said everybody took turns reading.  I don't want to do it.
So?
Neil, how are you gonna be in a play if your father won't let you?
But if he said no before then...
No, I want you in.  But being in means you gotta do something.  Not just say you're in.
From my father and Nolan.
No thanks.
Yea, art thou there?
We don't even know if his boat is still there...you saw Billy!
Who asked any?
Who gives a shit about aft?
That's where my boat's moored.
Jesus Christ lady...
Quite a few.
Self sufficient...
Yeah you did...
What's the matter?
Looking good...
It's not them...it's it...
How about noise? Can you get noise? We don't need speed, just noise, right?
You want ME to go up there?
Shut up! You hear me!!
...we gotta get outta here -- NOW.
I don't know...you got what we need?
Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
Can somebody tell me what the object of the exercise is here?
You know what my goal is? Before I die I want to make love to a woman from every country on earth.
What was that?
Don't shoot, man, don't shoot!
She fucked me.
Damn right!
I'll get the boots.
Here. Here we go.  Here's to you, Nick!
John,we're going huntin'.
Who's full of shit?
They did not!
You, Vince! You! You are! You're a crock! You're a walking, talking crock!... I mean, what do you know?
You're back.
No, I --
Where is he???
I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much!
How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda?
Oh. Fine.
Get anything?
No.
Those fuckin' niggers. This time I'm going to eat balls!... You ever try 'em?
Yeah?
Hey, guys...
Take last night...! Last night he coulda had twenty fuckin' deer! More! He coulda had more! And look what he does! I mean look what he fuckin' does!!!
Why?... What do you mean?... Why???
You Biederman?
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking --
It was just the complications. I mean, you take a little thing over there and then you get complications. I mean all the guys had it.
How's the trailer?
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --
I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em!
What?
You seem... disturbed.
Merle?
You should have put that on last night.
I just wait. You know?
Huh?
You think about it?
You have to think about the shot. It's the shot. The shot's it.
Who's a yo-yo...? Who do you think's a yo-yo! They're all yo yo's. I mean they're all great guys, for Christ's sake, but... The point is, Nick, without you I'd hunt alone. Seriously. I would. That's what I'd do.
Pow?
I love this fuckin' place... That sounds crazy. I know that sounds crazy, but I love this fuckin' place... If anything happens, Nick, don't leave me there. I mean it. Don't leave me... You gotta promise, Nick. You gotta promise me that.
Huh?
They bombed last night, right? Didn't they bomb? If they bombed last night, they could bomb tonight. They could be up there right now!
What do you think?
We gotta play with more bullets.
I like it, Nick.
Then lemme have 'em.
No.
No!!!?
What?
No.
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
Great. Feels great... Fuckin' A!
And I believed you! I oughta punch you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey, let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey, Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do you say? Nick? What do you say?
Just like always! Just like it always was! Right, Nick? Am I right?
What'cha got, Bennett?
What did you say?
Fuck you - fuck you.
You son-of-a-bitch.  How do you stop it?
Hello Wade.
Remember my promise.
You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!
We have to talk.
You were planning to send me back to the ice house.  You set me up.
You okay?
I got it.  I got it.
I drive.
I'm ready.
Yes.
GCI.  TM-1.  What language are you talking?
You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
What's this place?
You're not pregnant, are you?
How do I look?
Demolition Man.
What's it mean?
This little thing says I can't.
Jabez! Careful --
No -- but I can hardly wait -- Mister -- tell me, will there really be --  -- a man that eats fire?
Why? It don't hurt.
Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
Anybody can see that.
No! No! I won't.
Mama!
Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
What Grange?
Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could.
Never mind. What's your name?
No, Stone!
Yes, I wanted to get here before the others.... I want to talk to you alone.
Now run along, Daniel.
It's mine?
What does it mean here -- about my soul?
Good evening, Neighbor Stone.
Are they all as -- small -- as that?
I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
What -- what's on your mind?
There's nothing like it. I saw an inchworm take a drop of it once, and he stood right up on his hind legs and bit a bee. Come -- try a nip!
Well, I --
But -- I was just lucky.
Yes -- and that's the reason I wanted to talk with you. You got my invitation?
Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.
Jabez!
You'll never change -- will you?
Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
Mary --
What happened.... Where are you taking him?
I am going to lock him up.
Well -- I am worried about the way you've changed. That was one thing you said you'd never do -- remember?
Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
I want you to fix these fish!
You throw mighty far, Jabez -- almost into the pigsty.
That is -- if you don't mind changing the lesson, Ma.
Let her be, son. She'll do all right. You better get yourself straightened out.
What a nice -- and kind girl --  Who is she --?
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?
Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that.
Oh, could you, Mr. Webster ?
Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner?
Why don't you?
Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to help me, man.  This is my first time driving a limo.
She had a good job, it turned into a great career.
But meant her moving here.
His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without him, they might let us go...at least we have a chance...
Ellis, what have you told them?
Hope I'm not interrupting...?
Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there?
I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
Bill, you know how to use a handgun?
One weekend I went to a combat ranch...  You know, that game with the, the guns that shoot red paint?  Must sound pretty silly to you...
You better heat up that miracle				* you were talking about.  We broke through on Number Six, and the Electromagentic came down like a sledgehammer...
I...have a request.
We have a pregnant woman out there --  -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good.  I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa.
Nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync.  I think it's me.  Is there a place I can wash up?
Well, Cappy Roberts retired out here a couple years ago.  He said I could bunk with him.
Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
Excuse me, I'm looking for --
How do you know?
The plastique I found.  Is the building on fire?
'Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'
You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
I'm here, cowboy.
Roy?  You still with us?
Hey, you couldn't know.
Bullshit.
Then who the hell have you been talking too?
He claims?  Powell, has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists, pulling your chain? Or some kind of nut case who --
What's it look like?  We're going in.
Going in...are you out of your mind? There's 30 hostages in there -- for all we know --
No.  I never smile any more.
Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene?
They jet's comin' out.  But don't let 'em off the ground.
Don't let 'em off the ground.
Jesus, you're the man!
I was lookin' at it.  I saw you, man!  Jesus!  You oughta see yourself!  You wouldn't believe it.
They don't know, I sent them to the neighbors.  Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you.  I can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day I knew you.
I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never.  I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
I'll kiss the baby for you.
Yeah.  It was terrible.
You can't talk or do anything.  You really feel... you know... I'm just sort of coming out of it now.
No really... I don't think that you realize what it means.  The things that you do, Sonny.  You put a gun to somebody's head...
Oh... they're fucken crazy.  That's a snow job.  Don't listen to that shit!
Yeah.
How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?
Okay, you're in there and we're out here.  What do we do now?
They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then.
You're all one way!  I'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin' ... Give me one of them, anyway ... Just one ...
I want a helicopter to get outa here!  And a jet to take us to...  ... wherever we want to go.  Outa the country, so no little jets.  A big one with a bar and a piano lounge.
The girl hostages.
Well, what were you doin' back there?
It can't happen again ... I'll do everything I can to stop anything I can ...
Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
What makes you think you'll be able to control it?
He's totally unstable.  He'll make a mistake.
Hey... let him out!
Where's the back door?
You got kids?
Are we going to get the ball rolling?
You know more than the Doctor? You're not okay, look at you.  Come on ...  ... let's get him out ...
Hey!  I'm tryin' to help you.
I stay here.  Damn it.  I just needed the insulin.  I'm used to it. Go on.  Go on.
I'll be God damned if you will.
You know - I had a job once.  I used to work in a bank.  I had been training ... I used to have a boss ... Mr. Don Frio ... he wore a toupee ... I wonder if you'd hire me if I came in here and asked you for a job ...
What now, Sonny?
I wish somebody would tell me I'm gonna live long enough for it to be a habit.  My parent, she'll be okay. My husband, he'll be okay.  I even know who the bum is gonna marry. Terrific.  She'll take good care of him.
Did you always call him Junior.
No!  I'm not kidding.  Don't you understand?  You're pure!
You shouldn't start now.
You're serious!
You're really pure, you know?  You got a perfect record.  You never used that stuff to ruin your body, why start now?
Hey, for christ's sake... now... fuckin' asshole...  He can't make it.
Where's the money?
But I want to know what you think.
You realize, Sal, that we're gonna get outta the country, so if you wanna talk to somebody, do it now ... You gotta Mother or a Father? Friends?  If we gotta be outside the country, where do you wanna go?  Any country. Just name a country.
Wyoming.
I never been up in a plane before.
Okay, Sonny.
Well, Jesus, these hostages are keeping me alive.
You got guts.  You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out?
Wait a minute!  What the fuck you tryin' to tell me?
I can't allow that, Sonny...
That's the jet.  You give us one more, now.  That's the deal...
Hey, let's get ready!
Mom - they're sending a bus to take us to the airport.  You understand? If you're here - they're not gonna send it.  They'll think I'm gonna come out with you.
No.  This really pissed him off, Sonny.  He says you're dead.  He says he doesn't have a son.
Get a job doing what?  You gotta be a member of a union, no union card - no job.  To join the union, you gotta get the job, but you don't get the job without the card.
Yeah!  We're hot entertainment, right?  You got me and Sal on TV ... we're entertainment you sell, right?
What do you want us to give you? You want to be paid for ...
Morning.
Where are we going?
Jesus Christ! What's that smell?
Promise me... you won't ever tell Domino.
<i>What is it?</i>
Your son... and your nephew have been kidnapped by these crazy game show hosts from the Fox network. <b> INT. CIGLIUTI COMPOUND -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Cigliuti sits up in bed.
Okay.
Yes.
<i>You drove Lateesha's daughter to school... then dropped her off at the DMV. Why?</i>
What the... <i>who is this bitch?</i> <b> EXT. HAWTHORNE COMMUNITY CENTER -- PARKING LOT -- NEXT </b> Ed and Choco exit the El Camino just as Domino retrieves her knife from the windshield. She grips it in her right hand... threatening them.
Hello?
What do you mean? Claremont didn't provide them?
This could break new ground in terms of traditional host models. It's self-reflexive reality television.
This girl is going to be a star. She just tells it like it is.
Just like Billy Ocean says. <i>When the going gets tough...</i>
I be.  I'm living large.
You don't like Public Enemy?  It's the dope shit.
I own a brownstone on this block.
What do you want to live in a Black neighborhood for?  Motherfuck gentrification.
And I--we--want some Black people up.
As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted by the finest.
What can you say?
Is it a good morning?
Yes indeed.  You almost got yourself killed last night.
Don't you have enough sense not to bother people when they're sleeping?
Wake up!
How come you're not at Sal's?
I'm coming.
He's just being nice.
Innocent!
That's my name.
Mookie, no cursing in the store.
Sal, can you do me a favor?
Mookie, I don't know what you're talking about, plus I don't want to hear it.
Yeah, do you know 'em?
I didn't say nuthin'.  You must have a guilty conscience.  What are you guilty of?
Ya just got paid, so leave me the fuck alone.
Yeah!...I'm goin' to the beach for the first day in fifteen years. Gonna take the day off and go to the beach.
Mookie?
I know I haven't seen you in four days.  I'm a working man.
I work too, but I still make time.
Bring some ice cream, I'm burning up.  Do you love me?
Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
Hot.  Hot.
How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.
Mookie, I told you already it's too fucking hot to make love.
Where are you going?
What?
Y'know, I've been listening and reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't know that, did you?
It's e-vit-able.
I love you, my brother.
Sez who?
I love you.
How do you know this?
C'mere.  Don't get too friendly with da Mook.
Turn it off.
No, I'm not it.
Yeah, you are. He touched you. You're "it" until you touch someone else.
Sleeeeew sheek baw...
Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.
I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
HARRY!
You did?
Oh, you want to talk about your delicates?
Yeah...
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
No, I'm fine thanks.
Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
Then a sleep-over is okay by me. Okay boys, eat up.
Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie!
I go to school where I live.
No, it's a treasure map.
Cool.
Yeah, dangerous cult. Don't make eye contact or they might talk to you.
God, she's beautiful. My wiener's all tingly.
No, I just usually eat my lunch on the crapper. Saves time. Out with the old, in with the new.
H A R R Y...
No! Captain Rob is seven feet tall, wears an eye patch, got a hook for a hand...
You're not my real dad.
Where did you learn that word?
I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
...cause you said...
Our own special bus.
Sucks for you.
Shut up!
Just wanted to see how your doing.
HARRY, can you hear me?
Do you want me to pet your head?
Do you hear something, Captain Rob?
HARRY, would you like to share with the rest of us what's so funny?
Me, me, me!
A raft.
George Washington!
Hey, look. Ice cream.
I... found that rock.
I have no idea - it's full of files and documents and tapes.
What was it Jessica wanted us to do with this chest again?
We never thanked him for giving us our Special Needs class.
Oh my god. Can you believe your ears?
She's one of a kind.
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
THAT'S NOT YOUR TAPE.
You're just jealous.
You know, "some". The fag stuff.
Where'd that come from? He holds up a giant key chain.
Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup.
Hey you two. Lights out.
Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world.
LLOYD, may I see you a minute?
Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine.
Collins can be a pretty crafty guy, what do I do if he smells the trap.
I don't think he'll smell anything - just make sure he takes the check. I've been through this a hundred times.
God, I've missed you.
It's the big potato.
Aloha means hello and goodbye.
You got the Extender?
Oh, just like the President.
This is horse?
What happens now?
Can you hear me?... If this visit has anything to do with spice... -- The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite violently in his tank.
I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."
My Lord?
No, but many consider my training valuable.
As the legend says.
Your Reverence.
Yes...
Spice!... pure un-refined spice!
It burns.
The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
Say, that's a funny place to sleep.
It is my home.
Really?
I am getting tired.  I need to take my medicine.
I am always on time.
Eh, forget it.  What else is big?  Teenagers!  Jailbait pics!  Yeah... You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks --
Hmm... my biggest hit?  That would probably be "Dracula."
Let me take you to the hospital.
So how'd we do?
Bela, I don't know what I'm doin' anymore...
Do you know I turned down "Frankenstein"?
Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.
Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?
Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
Oh.  So what is the scene about?
Okay.  But what if I'm not in <u>too</u> big a hurry?  What if I take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life?  To smell a flower?
And, cut...
Mexico!  And guess what I'm going to do there?!
You mean a Tesla coil?
Rolling.
What do you mean?
What happened?!  Jesus, Connie, what did you do?
I guessed.
There's no such thing as a psychic. People believe my folderol because I wear a turban and a black tuxedo.
Well... there's a lot of junk in his system for such an old man. Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone.
What?
Ed, you're still young.  This is the part of your life when you're <u>supposed</u> to be struggling.
Eddie, I don't understand.  Why are <u>you</u> the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story?
Better than not getting a job?
Boris Karloff!?
How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people?
Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
That's the problem!  <u>Nobody</u> cares about my movie!  I'm tryin' so hard, I don't know what else to do!
Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
Of course I'm here.  Today is the file clerk's big scene.
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
Eddie, which dress do you like better?
Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part.  The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller.  The title is "Bride Of The Atom."
Mr. Reynolds!
Yes?
Glad you could fit me in your schedule.
So, Mr. Johnson --
But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
I like.  When do movie shoot?
I'd be happy too, if I had such a great family.
Ugh, I hate when that happens.
Can I help you?
So you're not gonna make the movie?
Are you a fruit?
There's still a sex-change --
I don't think he's a schmuck.
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
Um, I guess --
Booties for my father.  He gets cold in this hospital.
You look beat.
Oh, flowers!  I didn't know you were so traditional.
Well you tried --
Ed, I'm so happy for you.
Excuse me, Miss Vampira?
You want me to show it on my TV program?  Well I got nothing to do with that.  You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven --
Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...
What octopus motor?
Mr. Wood?  <u>What do you think you're</u> <u>doing</u>?!
What are you, an angora wholesaler?
Vampira!  Hi, this is Ed Wood.
You mean like a date?  I thought you were a fag.
At what point?
Whatever happened to Norman Rockwell?
Yeah, so... ?
You're nuts.
Yeah, that's why I called. I mean, maybe Fed-Ex would tell me where she moved --
This guy.
Really? They were..
What?
Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
Send him away.
Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time.
Who?
What's the matter?!
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
St. Joseph's.
Ma...
She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now.
Hi, Mom. 
What are you talking about?
I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?
No! I barely even mentioned -it's just that, my friends, the people at work, whoever I'm regularly in contact with they want releases from.
I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ?
Go!
Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you.
Oh God, this is so weird.
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
Um...
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
Shari, I really like you...
Shari...
Page three of the Post.
A poll. "Is Shari Good Enough for Ed?" Seventy-one per cent said "no."  They hate me!
So?
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
What's up?
What do you mean all of a sudden? You've been going with her six months.
You're gonna be a video store clerk for the rest of your life? This is your big ambition, rearranging the "Ernest" movies?
Screw off.
Okay, I just wanted to get your attention. My name is Ray and my friend Bucky and I design video systems. You've got an office or a big home, we'11 come out there design you an entire system.
Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name?
She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --
What are you, hiding from the Police?  Show your face, you look great.  Doesn't she look great.
Great.
I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?
You don't recognize me.
The whole time? Eighteen years?
No. Two times.
I'm Jill. I really like your show. I think you're great.
Oh!!
Ed?
We don't have foibles.
You could tell Dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place, and that could get a little irritating sometimes, but basically he was a real good guy.
Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...
what?
Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up
Dick... Dick,..
I'm not supposed to tell. Not until you've counted too. We're each supposed to make an independent count.
I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --
Mr. M.?
Yeah?
Mostly Tammy fans
Now at the end of her junior year, Tracy was poised to win the presidency of the student body.  And so far she was running unopposed.
I got all my signatures.  One hundred and fifty-eight -- way more than I need!
Here they are.
Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we "interrogate?"
So what brings you here?
What's this?
What a surprise.
Okay, Jim. I understand.
More this way.
I can't afford this stuff right now.
No, I... uh, didn't know that
Yep.
Right now?
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
I was lonely.  You took advantage
Okay, let's say
Are you crazy?
What?
Well, I mean, you know, I talked to him and everything, but he just said he thought it was a good idea... and how there's all different kinds of fruit and...  It's nothing against you, Tracy. You're the best.  I just thought --
Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.
Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
Paul, get out!
How's the left these days?
Merry Christmas.
That obvious, huh?
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
I wondered when you might ring the bell again, Officer White.
Do you like being a cop, Bud?
He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
We talked.
Call me Dudley.
<u>What do you want</u>?
What work?
Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?
Yeah, that's Stens.
The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
Dudley's guys.
Ellis Loew.
Bud...
Against your code?
I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill out my little studio.
What little studio?
I got her address.
Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
What do you mean?
Ed, your observations have been astute.  What's your assessment of this situation?
More or less.
Anything?
Dogs got no reason to live.
Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
Man, what're you saying?
But you were business associates?
And?
Dudley, we've been over this.
Answer yes or no.
Don't get sidetracked.  Stay with the Nite Owl.
A disgrace as a policeman. Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under. What about him?
No.
What about you?
Damnit...
Glasses.
Even I'm not that crazy.
Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.
Listen, I think I made a mistake, too.
Why do men and women usually see each other?
Really?  What did White say?
It galls you that I know so much about you.  You don't have information to compete.
I'll take your word for it.
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.
Do you think I ever could've been in the running?
Okay!  You're right!  Dudley's got photos of me and Reynolds.
And Reynolds?
Sid, cut the crap.  I --
What happened with the kid and Loew?
You didn't get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute.
Brill?
What happened?
What'd he say to you?
209 to anyone! I need some help here!
I don't want any money. And believe me, I have no interest in ruining your life. I'm not interested in this tape.
Listen--
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
Clear as day.
We've also been informed that the Grand Jury is going to call for an investigation into your affairs.
Who was that other guy?
What <u>is</u> that?
It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch.
Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
I don't know <u>anything</u>.
No shit.
And you won't. Now move--
<u>Here</u>?!
In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building.
What the fuck?!
What if we transmitted it over cellular?
If they couldn't do that, they'd shut down the whole system, all the relays.
What if--
Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
We're gonna lead Albert by the nose to one conclusion. And then when he's pissed as hell, we're gonna drop the tape in his lap. How fast can you teach me what I need to know?
Is Jerry Delsano in?
Who's calling?
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
That's fine.
You'd like to buy your wife some lingerie as a Christmas gift.
Is that good?
Very good.
I think she'll like this very much.
Because my life is being ruined.
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.
What kind of trouble.
I can't.
To buy lingerie.
For your wife?
Bobby!
What'd you buy at Harrison's?
How'd you get the information on DePinto?
Yeah, but you said you've never met him. How did you--
Stacy, I found out like this. This is the first I'm <u>hearing</u> of--
I've seen it.
I see her for business.
Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
I know, but listen--
I went to the grocery store. My ATM and credit cards didn't work. I couldn't buy food.
This is science-fiction Robert! The manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it.
Is it over?
It's really over?
A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now.
That's probably not you in the picture. I tell you what, I'll just run the thing by the Grand Jury, see if they can't--
Actually, that's not true.
It is fish.
Brill.
Ten thousand cash. I don't know if it's Brill's prices going up or your commission.
He doesn't work that way.
I <u>did</u> care how.
I'm sorry about that.
Otherwise you may have to what?
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
We'd rather not--
Jesus! What?! You want money?!
My shoe?
Hey!
And may I ask what could possibly be more important than Fawell Oil v. U.S. Environmental Agency?
Maybe Bellmoth. Maybe the unions. I don't know.
Because they've been paid off by Bellmoth.
In your dreams.
Where's mom?
Are you and mom getting a divorce?
No.
No.
Why don't you give 'em a call.
I don't know!
You gotta let me bring you in to the police.
Go to 'em, Jerry.
Bobby? Piece of advice?
Yeah?
Bobby--
Tell me about it.
Dick Burns got a phone call this morning from someone wanting information on you.
The police?
No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?
Yes. But we can't.
Why not?
What happened?
What about the tapes?
We found the originals.
There was a transfer.
Am I to understand--
Who?
30 minutes ago you said we had him. What in hell's goin' on out there?
Sir--
We found two sets of latent prints in the rubble of Brill's studio. One was Dean's. The other, we believe, belongs to Brill.
We believe?
Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
How'd you get in the building?
The fuck do you have goin' on with Sam Albert?
I don't care to bargain.
I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this.  I apologize if I appear abrupt.  I am rusty at social graces.  How do you find Cairo?  Did you visit the Pyramids?
Excuse me?
What's this?
What am I looking at?
Don't.
When were you most happy?
Marmite - addicted!  Baths - not with other people!  Islands.  Your handwriting.  I could go on all day.  My husband. Almásy nods.
A lie.  What do you hate most?
Say you're sick.
It's a folk song.
Madox knows, I think.  He's tried to warn me.  He keeps talking about Anna Karenina.  I think it's his idea of a man-to-man chat.  Its my idea of a man-to-man chat.
Dance with me.  I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
We've got to get you out of here.
What?
Good morning!
I understand you are agitated - perhaps you would like to sit down while I radio back to HQ -
Her hands and feet were tied.
Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
When's Clifton picking you up?
Hey!  Hey!  Stop this jeep!  Let me out of here - there's a woman dying, there's a woman dying while I'm - Hey!
Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I'll give you a fucking good hiding.
It is you.  This was taken in Cairo at British Headquarters - July 41. And so was this - August 41.  And this -February 42.
Don't cut me.
So you can shoot a pistol?
Where've you been?
I liberated it.
I think that's called looting.
Hello.
Hana tells me you're leaving.
Thousands of people did die, just different people.
Lady H said she thought you might be -
What?
Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
What was all the banging?  Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
Candaules…you're laughing at me.
No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
Could I have a cigarette?
Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
He's Canadian.
He needn't disturb you.
Could I ask you to move?  I'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, I can't really bear the sheets moving over me. Sorry.
I'll probably marry him.
Really?  That's sudden.
I'm still here.
Never heard of it.
Is something funny?
What do I do?
You get Hardy.
I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.
The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion?
I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.
I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever… you and Lieutenant Singh…
He's sleeping.
I've got a surprise.  A boat!  We can go to Capri.  It's got a cabin, it's private.
Yessir.
How awful.  What will you do?
- The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum.
What about your rank or serial number?
How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
You didn't answer the beeper either.
I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.
A thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. What we don't get is how he effectuated his entry.
Mac's signature.
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
No you can't.
I'll call an ambulance.
Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
I've got something for you.
Possibly.
Very nice.
Lose something?
I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
Why are we in separate--you know, separate rooms?
Good morning.
As I recall, you've robbed it before.
You don't have any idea how lucky you are!
True enough.
No, no, I want to. I'll just go into the village.
Certainly the most beautiful crook I've ever seen.
Terrified. Still am.
Okay, you're a thief.
What?
Hmmm...44 long.
Idle hands, the devil's workshop.
Peoples China Bank.
That's the beauty of it. There's only one tiny window of time when this will work. At the handover of Hong Kong--from Britain to China. The handover from them to us.
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.
Parachute.
Jesus God, it's going through.
But--
Remind me why.
Tonight your league night?
Doesn't look like much. How come those Commos want it so bad?
You know where my loyalties lie.
My friend, you always surprise me.
... what we do in here is keep track of all the case files.  That way, at any time, we can find out a case's status -- where it is in the office, stuff like that.  We file 'em all here, alphabetically --
Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.
What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.
Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
Erin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her fault, she says.  And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think?
How does someone get meningitis?
I added air conditioning, put in the pool, made all those pillows by hand ...
An on-site monitoring well?  That means --
And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
For what?
A number for the whole group, or for us?
If you hadn't used profanity --
Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God damn, he made me look like some cheap --
Jane's the office manager.  She handles payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early on Fridays.
How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.
Erin, you've been gone for a week.
What are you doing here?
He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million.  And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings.
They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad.
I want a raise.  And benefits.  Including dental.
Ten.  There's a lot of other places I could work.
They used the hex chrom here, in these cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive.  Then they dumped it here, in these six ponds.
They covered 'em over.  And not too carefully either, cause you dig one inch under the surface, and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock.
And that's what caused the contamination?
We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.
D'you get his name?  Course not.  Jesus, Ed --
Whoa.  No shit.
Counts?
She insulted me!
Bullshit.  You'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you.
Look, this is serious now.  They're talking serious money --
And if you had to guess ...
I did.  Both.
Oh, okay.  Here it comes.
The extortion, the threats ...
You know what, Erin?  I got nothing but time here.  Why don't you let me do that for you, and you can get your kids some dinner.
What kind of chromium is it?
There's more than one kind?
Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?
Hey -- those are my files --
Whose number do you need?
You want my number?
Great.  Another deadbeat.
I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to.
Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
I hope that's not supposed to impress me.
Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
Nothing.
I'm bored, and so are the kids.
Yeah, you can.  You could just quit.  People do it all the time.
What time is it?
It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be a good mother.
You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
Hi, sweetie.  Were you a good girl?  Where are Matt and Katie?
What?
My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me.  I'm going to move in with her.
Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
He can do it.
He'll learn.
Will he finish what he begins?
The boy is our last hope.
You must survive, Luke.
... the power?
Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.
Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
What is thy bidding, My Master?
Our destruction?  Who?
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.
Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you.
What are you so grouchy about?
Does Luke know?
Not you?
We've got to get out of this shower.
Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.
What are you afraid of?
No lightspeed?
You could have warned him before you shut him off.
You look silly.
I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
About what?
That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?
This ought to be good.
You don't know much about much if you think Vader won't want us dead before this is over.
Thanks.
.... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire.
We have no use for your kind.
Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.
We've got to find Luke.
What?
Someone's falling.
A tremor!
What are you talking about?
He wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.
Jabba the Hutt?
Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.
No, no.  This will not do.  Anger is what you feel.
Four this time!  The Force you feel.
I feel cold.
This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force.  A servant of evil it is.  Into it you must go.
Will they die?
The fear does not reach you.  You have learned more than I anticipated.
All too easy.  Perhaps you are not as strong as The Emperor thought.
The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.
Excuse me.  I didn't mean to disturb....  What am I saying?
So am I.  And I mean you no harm.
Nobody's going to believe it.
Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad.
What, Lewis?
There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.
No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.
But he isn't us.  He's your own kind.
Please
His reactor's starting to overheat.
Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
Shit.
I was called away on urgent business, Snake.
I see your point. What's the favor?
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
Top secret. Only on a need to know.
So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
Get this crap out of me.
I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken.
I'm here.
Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride, and you came through. Not bad for a dirtbag like you.
I said pull over.
Where is it?
Yeah, kinda.
Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.
Are you crazy?
Where's the anti-toxin...?
Is he coming?
In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make you a knight. Rise, Sir...
--That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.
You are still the best knight in Christiandom. You gained a hundred advantages over me. It is I who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson.
My domain is here, inside this metal skin. And I would pledge to you all that I still own: muscle, bone, blood and the heart that pumps it.
Merlin, will I live...?  ...I was dreaming...
Of Merlin?
Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
--Stories... You brought me back. Your love brought me back. Back to where you are now, in the land of dreams...
I will muster a great force of knights, and I will return to fight for what is mine.
Sir... Kay needed a sword. His was stolen. I saw Excalibur, and... I took it.
The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf.
You, my lord.
Because you and the land are one.
No.
The law forbids it.
Very well. Climb up.
I swear it. By Excalibur and the holy--
The oath. You didn't say--
It's not for you, Uther, hearth and home, wife and child.
And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.
I see, your excellency.
Hello?
Dinner at the White House.
Hello? Yes this is Mrs. MacNeil. Operator you have got to be kidding I have been on this line for twenty minutes.  Jesus Christ, can you believe this, he doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for christ sake.
Maybe the circuit is busy?
This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there?
Phonograph.
No, she was heavily sedated.
May I ask...?
We still don't know.
Want to ask him?
Excuse me Madame? Will there be anything else?
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
And those lies she's been telling?
Never.
Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.
Yes am.
No.
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
I beg your pardon?
Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody help her!
I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
Hey, where'd this come from?
I found it.
You know how?
Wait a minute you need two.
Well, maybe he's sleeping.
I love you Rags. We'll have a good day yeah?
Mr. Dennings?
But you like him.
I don't know, I just thought.
She doesn't remeber a thing.
Where'd you get the money for the Chivas Regal? The poor box?
I stole it.
She seemed fine.
I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan.
He broke the bread, gave it to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you and eat. For this is my body." When the supper had ended, he took the cup, again he gave you thanks and praise. Gave the cup to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you will drink from it, this is the cup of blood, the blood of the new and ever lasting covenant and the mystery of faith".
You'd like that?
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
You're not my mother!!!
Have we met?
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
And Dennings, you read how he died?
Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
Very much.
Fuck him Karras!!! Fuck him!!!
...look down in pity...
Miss?
Give me the keys!
Too bad.  You could use some sun. Really.
Start him out on cottage cheese. If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a few minutes.  Go down like pudding through a hot pipe.
Oh my God ...
When they coming in?
How we doing?
What's the point?
What's wrong with it?
Lotta water.
Fuck him.
It was an accident.
It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little one ...
She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that?
Only on odd days.
I'm not seeing anyone.  In particular.
Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?
So what'd we get her?
Frank?
So you'll come out, right?
Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
That's what we agreed.
I'm grateful, Frank.  How much? For the singer.
I told everyone seven-fifteen. Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.
No.
Hey, Frank.
Thanks, but I've got plans.
He's drunk.
Unless you want the right.
I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional.
She's a big girl.
I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
Hey, what do you know.  Looks like we can have that drink after all.  What's your pleasure?  We got the downtown Ramada. We got the Travelodge on Route 41. And ... the Mallory.
Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
Yeah?
What do you mean?
I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting here, I just had to come over.  Florence Simmons.
Okay.  I think that's all we need to know.
When?
What I mean is --
We'll talk about it later.  Right now, you gotta get changed.
Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
All right, but make it quick.  Shoes!  What size do you wear?
Uh... good.
Maybe it's legit.
Go ahead.
What'd she sing?
Hey, will you look at that?
What do you say we send a bottle over?
What?
Is that important?
Born and bred.
You should've brought a leash, Mr. Barker. The doctor doesn't like to be bitten.
Save it.  What's he look like?
Pretty much.
I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all.
Forget it.
Every year.
Can't sleep?
It's the waves.  God's music, my mother used to say. She was crazy for the ocean.
How do you do it? Every night?
Look. You don't know good. All right?
Friend.
I have to make him some chili. Okay?
Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it.
Soap?
Long story.
So, what happened?
So how's the cat food business?
Process server. Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular.  All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner.  And breakfast.
Oh.  Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
How do you know?
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
From Hurley's?
Sure.
Do I look wasted -- asshole?
Don't they ever let us take these boots off?
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --
Nice-looking kid.
And this thing can grow it?
We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.
You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that?
Who is this?
Why point it at me?  I'm the real thing.
I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off.  I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together.
She doesn't know -- and she never will.
One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
-- Castor?
They're too tight.
When did you start smoking?
What?
You're supposed to be snitching, making me look legit.
I'm just having some fun.
No.  Most of them are in transit by now.  I'm heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security.
What is with you tonight?
Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?
... That's great.
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
Excuse me?
No?!  You almost married this woman.  Aren't you even curious what she wants?
You're right, Jack.  Sorry... Jack approaches Alan.
But I think I like you better this way...
Fighting’s a part of it, Annie.  You know that, right?
This isn’t my real life. It’s just a glimpse...
On a case by case basis...
Don’t you think that’s a little gimmicky?
Is it morning yet?
I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
She said that?
Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack.  You’re not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
Wait a second...  Jack...Jack...
What the hell are you talking about?  What’s he talking about?
There's no way I was gonna die in that deli...  Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
Me?
What?!
Might wanna fasten your seat belt, Jack...
Figure it out.  You got plenty of time.
As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.
That’s it?  That’s all I get?!  A glare?!
You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
Mr. Mintz?  I don’t think so...building’s closed pal.  You’ll have to come back tomorrow.
...I was the number one junior sales associate at E.F. Hutton in 1988.  Did you know that?
Here we are, mag wheels...  Hey Jack, are you sure you’re okay?
But it’s twenty degrees outside...
Jack.  I said the kids are asleep...
Do what?
You had a heart attack?
I found it at an outlet store.  I know it’s a knock-off, but I think it’ll look great on you...
Okay...
You’re so...beautiful...
I'm sorry...
I’m moving to Paris...it was right here...  It’s a box marked “Jack.”  I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
Jesus, Jack...
Don’t do this, Jack... But he continues...
I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...
For the money, they’re hands down the best radial we carry...
Okay, I’ll take them...
Merry Christmas...
You don't know what it's like out there.  Walking around like some kind of circus freak.  People staring, whispering --
I wouldn't know anything about that.
I don't think She's real big on hate.
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
I'm not really dressed for a party.
Relax, it's casual.
Those yours too?
Isn't that <u>your</u> speech?
The shields on the station should protect us.
It's about to be a broken face.
Reed? ... Sue?
I'm worried about you.
What do you want, Vic?
And they're changing into...
What?
Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my nurse!
Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
So are you!
Flame on, flame off.  Flame on, flame off --
Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
<u>Ben</u> did this?
For science.
Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
There were a lot of variables to consider --
What are you doing?
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
Which is why I'm working <u>twenty</u> hours a day, checking every variable --
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
The Other Side got to him.
Before or after what he wanted to tell you?
Duval. Dr. Peter Duval. Top brain man in the country. Ever hear of him?
Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
Wish I knew why.
There'll be a team of Surgeons standing by. We're prepared to remove you immediately, should anything go wrong. In any event, you must be out within sixty minutes. After that, you'll be in danger of attack.
Shouldn't you answer that?
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
You're not the first, but he's much too innocent, much too involved with his work, to realize what's going on around him.
What do you mean?
That puts us right here... Which means we can head straight for the Sub Arachnoid Cavity.
Yes...
It's against my better Judgment...
Removal Point? What're you talking about!
"Yet all the suns that light the Corridors of the Universe shine dim, Before the blazing of a Single Thought -- "
If we can't go back, is there an alternate route?
I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
Looks like somebody declared war.
Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.
Sort of.
What happened?
Uh -- what?
Where's my daughter?
Can I see your license and registration please?
I don't think so. It's nice.
Huh?  Grimsurd looks at his thumb.
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -
I'm not gonna sit here and debate. I will say this though: what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense.
This was s'posed to be a no-rough stuff-type deal -
...The heck d'ya mean?
Yah, I got the money, but, uh -
You're there in thirty minutes or I find you, Jerry, and I shoot you, and I shoot your fucking wife, and I shoot all your little fucking children, and I shoot 'em all in the back of their little fucking heads. Got it?
Any others?
This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time.
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
Just a general way.
Uh-huh.
A subconscious-type thing.
You're not a C student.
Jerry - we thought you were bringin' us an investment.
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
Yeah, but -
...Brainerd?
Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month.
No, fax is no good, that's what I have and I can't read the darn thing -
Jerry Lundegaard.
Well... yah.
Yah.
Yah, pretty good.
Wade, have ya had a chance to think about, uh, that deal I was talkin' about, those forty acres there on Wayzata?
Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
Come by at 2:30 and we'll talk about it. If your numbers are right, Stan says its pretty sweet. Stan Grossman.
Yah, thanks, Stan, it's a pretty -
But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.
Mm.
Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm not worryin'. I just, I was wonderin', see, I gotta get in touch with 'em for, I might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see -
Geez, you okay, Margie?
Yah, woulda been cold out here.
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
...Geez.
Geez, that's a good lead. The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35?
Gotta go?
Yah?
Oh, pretty good.
...This is a nice place.
Yah, ya know it's the Radisson, so it's pretty good.
Oh, yah, but there's not a heckuva lot to discuss. What about you, Mike? Are you married - you have kids?
...I was married to Linda Cooksey -
I think I remember Linda, yah.  She was - yah. So things didn't work out, huh?
You were such a super lady...  and then I... I been so lonely...
So?
Hello?
Margie Olmstead?
No. No. No. They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year.  Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone.
And this guy is...
Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.
Sorry - didn't copy.
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
My car! My car! Tan Ciera!
...Chief Gunderson?
You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?
It's just the three cent.
We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.
Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?
You want me to de-prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade?
I don't know if you're aware... your front door -- it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --
Here.
When?
No.
What... ?
Who did this to you?
Hello?
Tyler?
Tell the other person how you feel.
What do you do, Tyler?
What do you want me to do?
Thank you.
Could be worse.  A woman could cut off your penis while you're asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car.
Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
Well, I have to file a claim...
The things you own, they end up owning you.
A hotel?
Huh?
You called me so you could have a place to stay.
He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well...
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
This is crazy.
I know that.
What?
You're okay with this?
Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.
Promise?
It isn't... ?
Fucking sweet.
What do you want?  A statement of purpose... ?
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.  We are all part of the same compost heap...
If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
Why do you think I blew up your condo?
This conversation...
Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
Answer me, Tyler.
Why do people think anything?
You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
You... you can't be serious about this.
I'm pulling the green wire.
Don't pull the green wire.  Pull anything but the green wire.
Fuck your struggle.  I want out.
Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy?
Do something for me.
What?
Don't worry about us, sir.  We're solid.
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
It's what he would have wanted, sir.
Okay!  Okay, fuck it!  Use the basement!  Get off me!
Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning, apartment A.  A small, cramped basement apartment.
Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---
If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon.  When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your-face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it.  It usually means the difference between life and death.
The songs on the radio.  But wait.  I don't understand.  Why is this even happening to me?
I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
What about that?
No.  If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list.
Six duds in a row.
This makes no sense.  Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake.  Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested?
Calm down, Kimmy.  It's not drugs, just weed.
Take a guess.
Last July I dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident. They asked me what number means "good luck" in Jewish.
Yeah, so what happened?
New life defeats death?  Follow the signs?  Where the hell did you find that guy?
But it's over.  Isabella's baby was the key.  You saw her die and everything, right?
For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad.
And you're gonna die after me, right?
Thanks, Dad.  I'll call you.
How would I know? You think I'm some sort of...
Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you runnin' away from her house.
I don't.
And then the cabin banged and the left side exploded. The the whole plane... blew up. It was so real. Exactly how everything goes.
I got this... feeling... a weird feeling... I can't explain it...
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
I'm sorry we broke in.
So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
Get control of yourself!
Huh?
Your buddy made it out last night. The place went apeshit.
... and there's this guy with a black helmet and cape, right, and he's got this sword... except it's not a sword, it's light...
Show me how it operates.
Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
You okay?
Batteries not included.
That's it?  Some C-4, a map and a knife?
You wanna know why I stood up for this show?
What's this stuff on the rice?
She likes you.  Says you're dinky- dau.
Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
Alright.  Home run.
It's orders!  You remember... when they tell you to do something and then you do it.  John Wayne is dead, man.
Are they going to torture us?
Yes.
Can you handle the door gun?
It's a Soviet MIL MI-24.  Probably has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat-seeking rockets and wire guided missiles, plus...
I thought he was with you.
Why'd they want us?
Alternate LZ Zulu Sierra at 0500. It says "May have heat.  Don't be late.  All our love."
Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
You pathetic scum.
This operation is in two phases. Recon and rescue.  You are phase one.  Your two-man team will probe the site, confirm the presence of American POWs, if any, make photographic and tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the enemy.
What's up?
I know.
Look, Colonel... we're all adults here.  This is a war.  A very quiet, very intense war.  People get sacrificed.
But you're right... some people do get sacrificed.  Now tell me why you pulled the plug.
Seems like I'm always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other, doesn't it?
This your stuff?
Yes!  They'll be in soon.
...So he says to me, "you'll never find another man like me"...I said, "please, men like you have one hand on their dicks and the other hand on their mother's leg... I said, there's the door - take a trip.
Well, don't say it like that. It's not so...ya know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman... You hold a steady job. Ya not crossed eyed or anything...
Well, there's nobody special!
I mean, it's not easy in this day and age.
I was attacked.
I... I stayed at a friend's.  Listen, I --
I tell you something, Anne.  I really feel like I'm cursed.
I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.
He's not a moron.
So what's going on?  Who's Lou again?
It's so great to see you like this, honey... I can't tell you.
Thanks.
"I'm an incredible woman?"  What is this, a death sentence?
No.
Bullshit!  If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  He'll snap out of it?
But..How could that happen?
No...  He is supposed to live there?
Yeah, well... I let him stay there. What else could I do after such a tragedy?
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
It was a crime.
I... I was just leaving.
Fine.  I'll say no.
You get a VCR with the membership.  ... For a short time until you get your own.  Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out.  See if you're interested.
This is it. I'm in hell. Damned to an eternity of idiotic conversation.
The Holy Grail?  Some billionaire has the Holy Grail sitting in a commode on Madison Avenue?
I know!  You can't imagine how surprised I was.  Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side.
Here's another twenty. Will that do?  I mean, what's it going to take!
O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
Parry...
.....What are you doing?
Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
I'm sorry....I'm just so excited.  You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?
OWWW....What are you nuts?!
You advise us!
I don't drink coffee...
I don't drink coffee...
Listen, you're very nice... b...
Oh no, I want to.  I've got a hard-on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night.  I have a confession to make?
Divorced.
Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
Yes.
Elton and Stoney know how I feel about you. An' they're just goin' to think I'm not too nice a guy, which I'm not, an' that you're a hell of a person puttin' up with me, that's all.
What?
You're depressed that I come along.
Washington.
Where are you going?
Hey, mack!
She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.
You always do this to me.
Sorry.
No.
What?
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
What?
Look at that.
Why are you being so mean?
I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.
Where is she, anyway?
Why?
Nothing.
It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.
I think it's what you think.
Serious, that's what's important to you?
I married him when I was 17. He was a cellist, and I thought he was the most brilliant man I'd ever met... And I'm sure he was, because at that age, I hadn't met that many... But he was insidious, you know. He had me convinced that I was a mediocrity, musically, as a woman, as an intellect. But in this completely imperceptible, pleasant way, so that you weren't even sure he was doing it. Anyway, I just woke up one morning and I said, you know something Joseph, you're full of beans, and I left him...
I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.
You've been staying in a motel all this time?
Steam.
The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...
Not now, I'm busy
I told you, no. I'm not that type.
So what you think of me?
I look good, that's it. So what else do you do for these girls?
I got punished, man.
She fucks it all up!
Yeah! Tell me which one you would like. To be doin' nothin on a fire escape or beat the pool with a bunch of girls? Be straight up!
How old is he?
What she look like?
You sure? She's got kind of like brown hair.
Probably.  One of the many.
No.
So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
What?
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
You're lucky.
You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?
Fletch.
Full name.
Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.
I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you?
We play tennis at the club.
Right.
Like tonight.
Jesus.
My pleasure.
Thought so. What for?
What?
Nothing. They're still there.
Oh, God, I think I'm about to hyperventilate. Have you got a paper bag, or something.
Is there anything particular you're looking for?
This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
You should have proved that in a court of law.
I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
Yes. Where you from, Harry?
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
Hi Gummy. How’s the eye?
They bust you every week.
Yeah. Maybe.
You don't look sick, Mr. Stanwyk.
Why don't you try suicide?
Precisely. Are you a good shot?
That's right.
Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
I'm sorry?
Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception?
I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great.
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
What's he doing in Utah?
I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think... What do you want?
Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
Thanks for the great time.
He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.
Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented...
Don't worry, I can take it.
They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
Lock's busted.
I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
What?
Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
Well, there we're in a gray area.
Thanks for the vote of confidence, Frank.
What?  Who the hell are they?
Not really.
I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
Don't say it.  Orange juice?
Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
They did one of these about my ex- wife.  It's called 'The Nutcracker.'  'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money.  I need some questions answered.
I haven't seen her around, and as for who would want to kill Johnny Crunch, line forms to the left. You'd find less people on our planet who wanted him alive.
All your friends call you Jazz.
You wish.
Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
Rock stars!  I'm going out of my mind.  All I get are perks.  I don't make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks.  I want cash.  Moulah.  Wampum.  Dead Presidents.  Andrew Jackson. Gerald Ford.
Why did you interrupt?  Maxwell seemed like he wanted to hire me.
What did you... Hey, where's your spex?
You okay?
I believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet.  What were your words...  'A fucking C.D.  This case is closed.'
After their initial investment in the factory, Grendel didn't need them.  Told them to fuck off. They tried to get these C.D.s together in order to have proof of Grendel's involvement, so they could keep him in line.  Now's the fun part...
What?  Jesus, tell me!
Because I know rock-n-roll.
I know the feeling.  This must be hell.  Can you believe, a flucking sorority... I'm gonna vomit Day-Glo.
Well what is it?  I'm not Kreskin.
Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
It's some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and now, this society dame.
You gotta be kidding!  This is unfuckingbelievable!  I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!  Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard!  Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a fucking footnote I've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino's Pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... Tonight was different. I felt respect.  I felt love.  Then Jazz left me... and <u>now</u> I get to die!
Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection.  I'm Julian Grendel.
And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits.  Shit, just start torturing me, man.  I didn't even know Johnny had a disc and I can't deal with any 'Don't play games with me, Mr. Fairlane' bullshit.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing.
This isn't music!
Did I say you could move that hand -- I'm not gonna get stuck am I?
Doesn't register.
Yeah?
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Twelve o'clock... yes...
Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat.
Pour moi?
Le sommes nous?
Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
I'm afraid they've become a bit... over-cautious.  Our American friends.
We must follow it.
It's beautiful.
It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.
What?
Where's he from?
Marseilles.
Why not?
That's crazy.  You lost the Frog in the subway and you blew our cover. If they haven't moved already they're not gonna move now.
Who stuck up the laundromat?
Never trust a nigger.
Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?
The guy's a frog -- I'm pretty sure. Also he made me.  Stayin' on four but went up to six -- cute.
Gotta be another way up, Frank.
You didn't marry Donna Reed.
Butch called.
He did.
I love you, Bud.
There's something I gotta take care of. Something I need to tell you about.
Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is here John.  You hear me?  Satch is here.
What is going on here, Satch?  What are those guys doing out there?
415 Greenwich St.  #302.  Under the body of a murdered woman.
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
What if I could prove it to you, Satch?
Next time lets put some money on it.
Queens, New York.
Hello?
Uh huh...
Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.
29 years...?
I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a dream.
How could this be happening?
I don't know.
What's that?
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
Fire.
Don't go.  Don't go in that warehouse...
No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
What do I tell them?
He took your wallet?
Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
I'm not your uncle, kid.  Gordo, what are you doing here?
Sull!  What the hell!
How you feeling?
Longbranch...?
My father didn't die in a fire?
Which means he probably knew her.
I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.
Sounds good.
You work too hard, John.
She's pretty special.
My name is Abel.  And I am my brother's keeper.
Where are you going?
What're you gonna do?
Why don't we go take a swim?
That was the best yet.  Was it you... me... or the hammock?
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
Here.  Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
Which one is it?
What's this?
A hammock?
And, what about us?
You know him?
My whole world.
Are they following us?
Oh, jeez.
It's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge.  Jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind.
Ahh, nothing.
Did you hear me?!
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
Huh?  Oh, come on, Sis.  I'm tellin' ya, we can't play Clue with just two people.
No problem, Rick.  Come over and meet a former resident here, Tommy Jarvis.  He's got some kinda prank going about...
I've seen it.
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
-- look, just shut up.  Let's cut through the shit.  You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
Steven buggin' you?
I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!
Where the fuck is she, Duke?!
Sorry.
Oh my God, Steven.
I'm now begging you.
I'm gonna get your outta this.  Just hang tight.  Okay?
-- Miscarriage?!  Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?!
My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?
Ten dollars! Hell, I can't do that to you -- you can have her for a pizza.
So what else is new?  Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend.
I think it's time for some recreational activity, girl.
No thanks.
Yeah.
Did you hear that?
Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?
She never should've set foot on this ship. This is your fault!
I'11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss Mason. You'd better have your biology project ready or I'm phoning your parents.
Everyone split up -- we'll cover more ground that way.
He is not.
You're making a big mistake, Rennie. It's not too late to put you back on land.
Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.
You had me worried to death!
I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.
I'm glad you decided to come after all.
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.
Did you have an accident in the lake?
I...I don't know...
I heard you weren't coming.
Can he really take us home?
I don't know...we've gone off course or something...
Rennie...??
She wants a divorce.
That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
Asbestos lining.
Do we care?
Don't wait Efor me.
He'll hate it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
We're able to surprise each other.
I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?
Do you want to get some coffee?
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
What else?
Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
I am really, deeply sorry.
What's it like to shoot somebody?
Washed away.
This could be it!
Who is it?
Nicky comes on Sunday's.
If it's you, what are you doing here?
It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
My back is killing me.
I lost it. I lose everything.
I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.
I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.
Everybody else does. Why not you?
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
You made him strike out. You wished it on him. You want to lose. It's too hard for you to believe in something. It's hard to have faith. It's hard Nwork to trust somebody.
"It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day."
This could be it!
They're my team, too. I grew up on Boyleston Street. Right by Fenway Park. I went to fifty or sixty games a year. All by myself. I was one of those kids with scabby elbows. I called out to the players. `Look over here. Hi, I'm Steven. My parents are divorced.'
hat was this morning.
Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer. He's here to announce the death of civilization. He kills a play every time he farts.
Postpone. We have every right.
I've had three straight washouts, Sidney.
I hate the Mets.
You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
Yes.
I kissed her while she was laughing.
Yes.
Not one of Steven's finer moments.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.
He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.
Someone waiting for you?
In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so unfair.
"A high court judge has confirmed that Mr. Gandhi would have been within his rights to prosecute for assault since neither he nor Mr. Khan resisted arrest." -- I told you about English law.
"Take a fifth step, that we may serve the people."
You'd be Gandhi --  ...I thought you'd be bigger.
I'll take your luggage back, baas.
Fortunately such news comes very slowly where I live.
I don't know... I'm still searching for a "response."
You will respect the law.
Is it over if they arrest you now?
They're sparing no one, I see.
All right. Fine.
In Calcutta it's like civil war. The Muslims rose and there was a bloodbath, and now the Hindus are taking revenge -- and if we can't stop it there'll be no hope for the Hindus left in Pakistan.
Could we cut all news off? I know --
It's over.
How are you doing this, Vincent?  How have you done <i>any</i> of this?
You want to give your child the best possible start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.
According to this, he's a sick man.  Congenital heart condition.  Who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes.
We're already getting complaints about frivolous search.
A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
Often.
Twelve have a mission within the week.
Jerome--?
In a corridor.
Come on--we're taking off.
You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
I've got enough on my mind without that.
I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still drunk from last night.
By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, "How are you?"  Forty-five minutes later I reply, "Not bad.  How are you?"
How do I square the accident?
You can wear lifts.
Even with lifts I'm never that tall.
No bother.
Can that be, er, verified?  Were you alone?
Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?  What about <i>you?</i>  Where were you last night?
Friend?
So you didn't do it after all.
I can't.
What happened?
The name?  For the certificate.
I'm in a hurry.
A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank.
So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
Where did you get them developed?
You been okay?
That's not all of it.
I'll be okay.
Is he straight?
That doesn't hurt.
Keep going over these. I don't want anybody getting lost.
At least you were outside.
What about the bank?
Why?
So what. I've got to give him his money. That was our end of the deal.
What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?
And switched keys.
I can handle it.
What do you want to do?
From now on you just shut up and do as you're told.
Only one car.
I don't want to hear it.
Look, what you said yesterday... I guess that was right. It isn't worth anything if we don't make it together.
We get to Mexico, we can have a life.
I'll be ready.
So what?
Whatever happens... we're going all the way.
Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.
Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem, right near Salt Lake ... Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would you?
Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them.
STANDS AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT.
Hope you get to where you're going.
One thing though... how do I explain this to my wife?
Just in case someone gets a shot off.
Suit yourself.
Two.
I'll hang on to these. We don't need them till we get to Gollie«s. Okay. Any questions?
How's Mama and the kids?
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
Don't you want to go to the airport?
And I keep my mouth shut?
Well, I paid a hell of a price. Now for God's sake keep your mouth shut.
The three of us are going to do some traveling. We're going to take your car to El Paso.
You can't get away from me, Albert.
I didn't know who Doreen was. Thought she was just another bird.
Did Eric Pake pull her?
Nothing. What could I do?
What did he say?
Why?
You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank.
Jack?
Good evening.
Confidential, like.
I can't Jack. How can I?
No, don't Jack, don't.
What about?
Oh, do you?
Was he?
Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
Nasty.
What does he want that bloody great country place for?
That's why you waited for me.
No.
Did you work with him, Keith?
Ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine?
I won't be using the room tonight.
Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.
What is it?
My brother, Frank.
What the bloody hell do you think you're at?
Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch.
What you going to do?
Pension him off.
You're a bastard.
I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy.
Yeah.
Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?
...they hold on to their money...
All of 'em.  They, hey: it happens to us all.
You have to cheer up, George, you aren't out yet.
The whole fuckin' thing...The pressure's just too great.  You're ab...you're absolu...they're too important.  All of them.  You go in the door.  I..."I got to close this fucker, or I don't eat lunch," "or I don't win the Cadillac..." We fuckin' work too hard.  You work too hard.  We all, I remember when we were at Platt...huh?  Glen Ross Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that..."
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
It's not.
I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years.
No.  That's absolutely right.
That's thinking.  Now, he's got the leads, he goes in business for himself.  He's...that's what I... that's thinking! "Who?  Who's got a steady job, a couple bucks nobody's touched, who?"
What hard part?
No.
You...
You fucking build it!  Men come...
When they...
Someone should rob the office.
What could somebody get for them?
No.
So all this, um, you didn't, actually, you didn't go talk to Graff.
You didn't?
Is that what I said?
What?  What?  The leads.
You have to steal the leads tonight?
Yes.
I...
What if you don't get caught?
That's ridiculous.
Then tough luck, George, because you are.
Uh-huh.
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucked on the board.  You.  You see how...I...  I can't...my mind must be in other places. 'Cause I can't do any...
That's not...Fuck that shit, George. You're a, hey, you had a bad month. You're a good man, George.
I am?
He said he filed...
Were the leads...
Yes.  The cops.  No.
They aren't?
I was at home, where were you?
Yeah.  You know who doesn't?
No.
Shelly: get in the office.
I want to work today, that's why I came...
I meet gestapo tactics...I meet gestapo tactics...That's not right... No man has the right to..."Call an attorney," that means you're guilt... you're under sus..."Co...," he says, "cooperate" or we'll go downtown.  That's not...as long as I've...
Who told me wh...?  You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me.
What about the other two?
Bullshit.  John.  Bullshit.  April, September 1981.  It's me.  It isn't fucking Moss.  Due respect, he's an order taker, John.  He talks, he talks a good game, look at the board, and it's me, John, it's me...
Yes.  I am.  I'm sorry to antagonize you.
Yes.
Let me tell you something, Shelly. I do what I'm hired to do. I'm...wait a second.  I'm hired to watch the leads.  I'm given...hold on, I'm given a policy.  My job is to do that.  What I'm told.  That's it.  You, wait a second, anybody falls below a certain mark I'm not permitted to give them the premium leads.
You know what those leads cost?
John.  John...
Why?
The leads are assigned randomly...
I saw the board.  You've got four...
Now?  Now?
I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?  John.  John: my daughter...
Wait.  Alright.  Fine.  The one.  Give me the lead.  Give me the one lead.  The best one you have.
That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I'd like something off the other list.  Which, very least, that I'm entitled to.  If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am.  What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you.
That's alright.
I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
What does that fucking mean?
Why I don't...
If you tell me where the leads are, I won't turn you in.  If you don't, I am going to tell the cop you stole them, Mitch and Murray will see that you go to jail.  Believe me they will.  Now, what did you do with the leads?  I'm walking in that door--you have five seconds to tell me: or you are going to jail.
Do I have to tell you?  Moss.
Their check's no good?  They're nuts...?
Give me some leads.  I'm going out... I'm getting out of...
Hey, they're fuckin' garbage any case...This whole goddamn...
"You do get the opportunity...You get them.  As I do, as anyone does..."
That's right.
Shelly...!
"What we have to do is admit to ourself that we see that opportunity...and take it.  And that's it." And we sit there.  I got the pen out...
"Always be closing..."
...yes...
The hell with him.  We'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for...
You're a client.  I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry Farms.  I rub my head, throw me the cue "Kenilworth."
My wife told me to look into...
No, his wife is.
I've got to talk to you...
Monday.
To change our minds.
You don't count Saturday.
No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day.
What was yesterday?
And when was that check cashed?
What is?
No.  She told me "right now."
The deal.
It's nothing.
Guess who?
Have a good trip.
Did they...
It went down.  I filed it.
Yes.
The word from Murray is: leave them alone.  If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town...
I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
Mr. Cicci.  From the year 1927 to the present time, you were an employee of the &quot;Genco Olive Oil Company.&quot;
 What?  You read it in the papers?
The ink on your divorce isn't dry. Your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy, Michael Francis... was in some trouble with the Reno police over some petty theft that you don't even know about.
Connie, I want to be reasonable with you.  You have a house here, with us.  You can live here with your kids...and you won't be deprived of anything.  I don't know much about Merle; I don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on.  Why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see him any more. He'll understand.  But if you disobey me, and marry this pimp...it would disappoint me.
Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice people here.  Friends of Kay's. He'll never forgive me if you ruin his party.
It's not talk; I'm doing it.
Don Francesco.  You murdered my husband, because he would not bend. And his oldest son Paolo, because he swore revenge.  But Vitone is only nine, and dumb-witted.  He never speaks.
 You must understand, this is all new to me...
Gee, Frankie, it's good to see you. Reminds me of old times.
It's all right.  He stays with me all the time.
Great, Havana's great.  Lots of activity in Havana!  Anybody I know here.  Five-Angels?  Anybody?
Count on me; that's my specialty.
Jeeze, it's great you came along, Mike... You know, we've never spent a night out on the town together. I always thought you looked down on me for liking a good time.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
To go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing.  I've already made my move.
I don't have a lot to say, Michael.
He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.
It's the way Pop wanted it.
I know what you are thinking, Vitone, but you don't understand yet how things are.  Fanucci is of the Black Hand.  Everyone in the neighborhood pays him, even my father.
I bet you can't guess what happened?
That's off now.
Kay... Kay...
If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.
When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.
He doesn't want my help any more. He doesn't need it.
Just now when Johnny Ola showed up, he asked me to leave them alone. Ola is Hyman Roth's Sicilian contact.  I was on the inside of ten, twenty meetings with him.  But today Mike asked me to leave, like an outsider.
You're going to talk to him now.
Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
I took care of it.
Where's my brother?
I asked about Fredo?
The new government arrested him, held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people, including Roth's brother, Sam.  The American Embassy arranged flights for citizens; I'm not sure, but I think he's somewhere in New York.
His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.
The room has a bug in it.
Yeah.  He wouldn't even go out to dinner.  Just wanted to go home.
No strings.
You know there's a Senate Investigating Committee recently set up; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though-provoking to your name.
Do you owe markers?
And what's the price of their not finding out.
Senator, my client would like to read a statement for the record.
Senator Kane.
This committee owes an apology!
This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr. John Ola of Miami.
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.  I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it.
When he saw his brother in the hearing room, he knew what was at stake.  I don't think Vincenzo would have done it.  He loves the kids, too. Omerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It had nothing to do with me.  It was between those brothers.
Michael.
I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?
I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.
Still no word of your courier? We'll find him.  But at least this will satisfy our friends here. You've been invited to the New Year reception at the Presidential Home. I understand your brother is here as well; I hope he'll come.
Terrible.  I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting.
This is it!  We think it makes Vegas look like the corner crap game.
I deny his every charge.
We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.
How can you be fair with animals? They recruit niggers and spicks; they do violence in their own Grandmother's neighborhoods.  And everything is dope and whores; the gambling is left to last.  Let me run my family without you on my back.  I want them taken care of.
Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I have your loyalty?
This was my father's old study. When I was a kid, we had to be quiet when we played near here. When I was older, I learned many things from him here.  I was happy that this house never went to strangers; first Clemenza took it over, and then you.  My father taught me, in this room, never to act until you know everything that's behind things.  Never.  If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded with you in the Rosato Brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still sound.  I'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We have friends in some very important business that we're making.  Do this for me; you make the peace with the Rosato Brothers on their terms.  Let the word out that I forced you; you're not happy wit hit, but acquiesced, just because of me.  It will get back to Hyman Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can trust me.
I thought we would meet alone.
Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?
Your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me, and I want to show that I, too, have some Christian charity.  Her rent will remain what it was.
It never crossed your mind?
I'm not a kid.
I like my life.  I'm a free man.
Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
What're you talking about?
I'm not married.
A man who is not married has nothing.  He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.
You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo.
Well...no, not really --
Thanks.  Why do you do it?
What do I do?
What have you done with him?
Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
We have his note.
I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
These are your paintings?
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.
What was wrong?
Football in college.
I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me.  Of course I can understand your refusal.  It's a great deal to ask of someone.
We weren't rich.  But we weren't poor either.
I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.
Saw your movie the other night. Watched it with some friends.
No.
Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.
Proud?  Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
I'm not, you know.
Sorry.  Not today.
You know how it is.  You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it.
Do you miss it?
How long were you...?
I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.
You were a soldier?
It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.
Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place.
Run for what?
I better get you home before you catch your death from pneumonia.
Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
That only leaves the rest.
Tell me something, Clayton.  Do you believe in mercy killing?
That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here."
What was that?
Wait until I tell my friends I had you naked in my arms.  Won't they be surprised?
If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie.  See if his name's on it.  How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?
"The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
Then who did?
But the rest of it?  The killing headaches.  The phantom smells.  My inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. It's all nothing more than bad electricity?
Yes, yes, yes.  I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard.
I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like.
I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.
Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through.  I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.
Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look?
Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...
I'm not interested --
What do you mean -- ?
They just brought in Donny Astricky. Shot by a jacker ...
Let's get out there. And have them run down every 167 Shelby Mustang in the area ... Find out where they're at.
You want to come along quiet?
You have my word...
I know you.
I remember us having made some kind of deal, Randall. I don't remember this deal having some kind of time-limit. I look at you - here - in my town - and I'm confused...
You know my back.
I know you.
I'll catch you later, Randall --
What for?
Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
C'mon, man ...
Donny --
Lookit Kip. All grown up...
You guys have any skills at all?
Peugot convertible ...
Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ...
How you doing, man?
All I get are the Orientals. They can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em So? What are you doing here? What's with the outfit -- ?
How's it going -- ?
You look good...
Atley Jackson came to see me ...
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
Yeah -
Something like that -
About what?
You can handle it?
You?
"Shadow games?"
What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?
That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...
Come here --
Sure, man --
Hospital.
Take it back, Freb --
How's it going?
On account of Mitch?
I go with you --
That what you want?
No way ...
What the hell's that -- ?
Stop. What about Maserati Boy?
What about The Club ... ?
I heard rumors you were back. About Kip ...
Are you considering a comeback tour?
"A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them..." Nietzsche said that.
Is he still working here ?
I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...
Dinosaurs. All of us. The Ice Age is now...
This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.
She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... But its actual output is closer to 600 ...
I logged outside the G.R.A.B. site, right? Then I monitored their incoming outside data requests, right? Then I got these ISDN numbers, right? Then I tracked them back, right? Then I took the one I could jack-up the easiest, right? Then I called back see, they think I'm an insurance company - that's where it looks like I'm coming from -- and they're sharing stats with this insurance company, right? So now they're sharing it with me, right? They think I'm looking for stats for an actuarial conference on auto-theft. So they let me in, right? Give me all these numbers. But then I don't leave, right? I'm in. I've got the key. Now I just go anywhere I want.
I don't want any more of that Shit.
Anybody!  You understand?
It was easy money. I did it in the can.  Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.
I'm gonna need some money.
Henry.  Wake up.
It's all bullshit. I swear. It's nothing. Whatever you want, we'll do.
I thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten o'clock this morning?
I'm just having my last few drinks.
What are you talking about?
Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody.
But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.
She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.
At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.
Who's gonna do that?
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
What happened? You okay?
Paulie was just talking about him.
Nah.
I better call again.
What happened to you?
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
He's insulting me. Rat bastard. He's never been any fuckin' good.
Will you get the fuck out of here.
What kind of person doesn't call?
He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
Ma!  Stop! What do you want me to do?
Don't worry about the schools. We'll take care of the schools.
But I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of things. Paulie.  You know me all my life.  I've always done the right thing.
Two weeks? That's nothin'. My Uncle Marty? Will knows him. That guy fuckin' drinks like you've never seen! One night he was drivin' back to his house on I-93-- Statie pulls him over.
Suck my cock!
Yeah, so he's like "Check the front of my truck, I can prove I hit it 'cause there's probably some blood or something"--
What'd you get? You get leniency?
Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.
Hi.
I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
--That isn't funny--
Yah, that is a nice ass.
How much money you got?
Morgan, Let's go.
Oh my God, I got the most fucked up thing I been meanin' to tell you.
Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before.
What'd you say about me?
What class did you say that was?
Hey, come on pal we're in classes all day. That's one thing about Harvard never seizes to amaze me, everybody's talkin' about school all the time.
Well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. You'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, Advanced algorithms--
No students work for me.
Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building--
Which one's your building?
No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. TERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
Really?
This rectangle is subdivided into rectangles. One edge of an inner rectangle is an integer. Can you prove that one edge of the larger rectangle is an integer?
That would be a monumental waste of time, wouldn't it, Will?
I told you to cooperate with these people.
Will, on your own time, you can do what you like. When I set up a meeting, with my associates, and you don't show up it reflects poorly on me.
What are you smiling at?
Have you heard of Jonas Salk?
Hello.
Since Nancy died.
--That's right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England.
No, he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over. It was pretty impressive, actually.
You're here quite a bit, then.
I think so.
--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
--Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.
Now don't do that. Don't you do that! Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. That it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay! If you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been--
There is somebody...
That's why I love stock-car racin'. That Dale Ernhart's real good.
--you have a quality-- something you were born with, that you have no control over- and you are, in a sense, hiding that by becoming a janitor. And I'm not saying that's wrong. I'm friends with the janitor that works in my building. He's been to my house for dinner. As a matter of fact I did some free consultation for "Mike" -- that's not his real name. That's in my book.
Look, man. I don't care if you're putting from the rough. There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; Alexander the Great, Caeser, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny Terrio, not many straight men can dance like that.
Did you buy all these books retail, or do you send away for like a "shrink kit" that comes with all these volumes included?
Probably not.
What did you think?
How about Noam Chomsky's "Manufacturing Consent?"
Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me.
So what's with this place? You have a swan fetish? Is this something you'd like to talk about?
How'd it go?
Why not?
Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.
I just slid my ticket across the table and said "sorry fellas, I gotta go see about a girl."
Define that.
They're all dead.
Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do?
Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
Well, I'm here.  So, is that my problem? I'm afraid of being abandoned? That was easy.
Gotta go with the belt there...
Oh, I know.
It's not your fault.
Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
I was trying to be smooth.  But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you.
Yeah?
I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School.  I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that...
Your house must have been a zoo.
You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?
What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
They don't come over here that much.
What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?
I guess. I don't know. How do you remember your phone number?
What?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Then what are you afraid of?
--some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.
You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what? I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you.
I'm not honest?
Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
You doin' the hirin'?
Twicet now I've fell for that line. Maybe he needs a thousan' men. So he get's five thousan' there, an' he'll pay fifteen cents a hour. An' you guys'll have to take it 'cause you'll be hungry.  'F he wants to hire men, let him write it out an' say what he's gonna pay. Ast to see his license. He ain't allowed by law to contrack men without a license.
Will ya look at her!
How 'bout you?
Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though.
We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
I'd come back--
People done it. If they could, we could.
Joad. Tom Joad.
I can't hardly believe it. Camp I was in once, they burned it out--the deputies an' some of them poolroom fellas.
Say, who runs this place?
Been out travelin' around?
I been in the penitentiary for four years. 
Maybe Ma'll have pork for supper. I ain't had pork but four times in four years--every Christmas.
This is Muley Graves.  You remember the preacher, don't you?
What you figger to do?
What's the matter?
Casy! What you doin' here?
I dunno. Payin' five now.
They shore don't waste no time!  Take her out.
Goin' far?
You ain't got to get sore.
Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this.
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.
Ma. Pa.  Grampa, his eyes hurt and hunted and frightened and bewildered, scratches in the dirt.
Got any plants?
You mean I can't even get outa here?
How 'bout it?
Pa! Shh!
I was so scared we was goin' away without you--and we'd never see each other again.
How about it, Ma?
Yes'm, that was it.
Didn' you get no sleep?
I ain't full.
I kinda thought so. Felt like it.
She's gettin' prettier, Ma.
It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.
Well, maybe it's like Casy says, a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big soul--the one big soul that belongs to ever'body-- an' then...
Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us?
But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
But we couldn't *do* on any less'n what our share is now.  The chillun ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is, and they're so ragged we'd be shamed if ever'body else's chillun wasn't the same way.
Ya know, you're the second fella talked like that. I'd like to hear some more about that.
Take 'er on down, Al. I'll sign.
Lemme go! I didn't go to do it!
I never knowed it! All I done was pull that string!
I seen 'em b'fore you did.
Morning.
You sure you got ever'thing ready?
But wait. I still don't understand what you do.
You do not.
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
--No.
So, what are you doing now?
Bob. Bob Destephano.
So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again?
Never better.
Ahhh... it's all fucked up. Nothing adds up to nothing... you work your whole life, day in and day out-- try to make sense of it all. One day you're twenty-seven and what do you get to show for it...
Jesus...
You see someone?
You met people.
Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.
You're fucking psycho.
Shoulda brought my gun.
It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth?
Like heroin?
Is it something you've done?
Get the fuck outta here.
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
Will you come with me?
I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.
Come on.
We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.
How was your day, today, sir?
What do you want?
Thank you, no.
It's okay. It's Martin The door begins to open revealing Debi and Newberry.
Hello, Bob.
Well?
Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the --
That's strictly Bàader-Meinhof stuff.
Wait a minute--
I'm not happy.
Enough?
This is not good.
I spoke to your father the other day.
No, I don't have one.
Marty! It's me. Paul.
God it's great to see you.
Debi's house.
No. You drove us here.
It didn't work out.
I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek.
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
When I work with a horse, it's no good just me doing it. It doesn't work that way. The owner needs to be involved too.
You ever just stand still for a minute?
Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain.
Well, I, uh... you didn't...
Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.
I thought you lived in Chicago?
Enjoy the day.
The answer's no.
Five years. My son was born here.
Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom.
It is. It's lovely.
I don't know any other way, Annie.
Dad'll pick you up today, all right?
Fine!
I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India.
Oh. You didn't tell me.
What?
Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!
Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
You already did.
My period.
When? Tonight?
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
Okay. We'll see you later then.
How was the dinner?
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
What... Bo-... What about the magazine?
I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.
So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
Huh-huh. You?
You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.
No, it's okay. Believe me, there were plenty of times I didn't know what the hell was right.
How are you feeling about work?
May I have a suggestion?
Yeah, what?
Was the trip okay?
You want to take a walk with me?
What choice!!?
I was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids. Were you ever in Egypt?
They don't come better. But I don't deny there are times I wonder about things I won't have. Maybe one day I'll get to see Egypt. Maybe not. But I know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all...
Sounds like something Tom would say.
I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
Now, are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself? There are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing.
Promise?
I understand, but Annie, please...
... well, I just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way...  You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen!  Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve?
Bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle.
Well, I'd like to welcome Annie and Grace to their first branding...
It'd be a whole lot easier to pay the feed end of the month...
Don't you go to school?
I don't know if I can.
Sure?
Grace, I need you to come with me.
I thought your mom's coming up?
What, sweetheart?
Shouldn't we have invited Tom over?
Oh I clear forget. You had a call from some woman in New York. She sounded pretty wound up.
About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?
Welcome to our show!
Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
Oh yeah? What's that?
Right.
Dead.
Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?
Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll sleep normal hours? He's been playing with his computer all night for a solid week.  Well yes, he could be playing with himself. Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls, don't you?
You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade?  Right, Dade?!
How was school?
Hmmm.
Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.
Your slave?
We need your help.
Okay. I'll copy it.
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
Why did he come to you?
Shit!!
Uhhh.. ahahaha...
Gill.
It got you seven years probation. No computer, couldn't even use a touch tone phone.
However, we have come to believe that one Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus. He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We want you to help us find it.
The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
Phreakphreakphreakphreakphreak, dudedudedudedudedudedude... I gotta...
Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
Hello?
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
Congratulations.
From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.
They had a large chunk of the garbage file? How much do they know?
Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
What number please?
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
We need to talk.
Don't get angry.
Rachel, I've got an expl-- I've got an explanation.
Get up there Rachel!
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.
Oh dear God. Its all right...a bad dream, just a nasty old dream.
You know damn well about what.  You let them take it out of here.
Why shouldn't I?
I do.
Like the last time? How many people killed back then? How many kids?
Jamie, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I can go out with Brady tomorrow night. Its no big deal.
What?
I can't.
Rachel!
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
Hell of a night.
Where are you going?
You got your riot gun?
Get the outside shutters.
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
How can a man do this Loomis? Tell me.
How's it powered?
Thank you.
We just talked.
I'm never smiling again. Paul dragged me into the boys' locker room to tell me...
Shit!
I'M baby sitting for the Doyles. It's only three houses away. We can keep each other company.
He was standing right here.
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30.
He can still watch.
I'd say you must have the wrong number.
Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't.
Fancy.
Wait a minute here...
Annie, Paul's on the phone!
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
I wonder where they went.
Yeah.
Is that all you say?
Yeah.
Ten minutes.
A man wouldn't do that...
TOTALLY!
Is Annie around?
Well, she's totally not here.
Are you coming over tonight?
Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.
After the movie.
What about the rest of my comic books?
After the Jack-O-Lantern.
There's nothing else I can do.
He'll barely be able to sit up.
Ever done anything like this before?
I see.
Hi.
Hannah will invite some men over who don't look like Ichabod Crane.
That's disgusting!
And you, you-you're going?
I know.  I said that, but...  he said it was something he really felt like doing.
Mm-hm.
Hmm?
We're actresses.
Yeah.
Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
So, so, but it was when I was younger, so--
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
When did you first notice this?
You've had some dizzy spells.  What about ringing and buzzing? Have you, uh, noticed any of that?
Well, if it's nothing, then why do I have to go into the hospital at all?  I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels.  So I, you know, I won't go to the opera.
Like what?
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
Frederick's done this whole new series that I'm sure you would really love.
What are you doing here?
Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time.  I know you would.
Oh, yeah.
I have to get my teeth cleaned this week.
Not because of me, I hope.
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
Poor Hannah.
O-o-o-okay, Lee.  Okay, okay.  You, you, y-you've said enough.  It's my responsibility now.  I will work things out.
Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  I-I-I want to do things for you.  Hannah doesn't need me as much.  I'm being presumptuous.  Not that you need me.
Is something wrong?
It's over, Elliot.  I don't know how to make it any clearer.  It's over.  I can't see you anymore.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
And you're in love overnight?
You bet.
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
Are you angry with me?
Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us?  About our-our personal life?
But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
How about something to eat?
I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago.
Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!
Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
Oh, Jesus!
N-n-no, not that.
I can't keep my mind on the show.
Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
Hi.  Where's Holly?
So how are you?
You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick?  I mean, Elliot.
Let me get a little reaction here.  How's Elliot?
H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
I know, I know.
That's really nice!
You've always had good taste in husbands, so...
Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
Hannah and I...can't have any children.  Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it--  It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to--
Okay, okay.
No, Holly's game for anything. Holly takes after me.
True.
You admit that we're great cooks, right?
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, how about this?
Uh, you know, I think I can fake my way through a song.
Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.
Well, that...th-that's fine.
Hmm!
You're crazy!  That's not true.
It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
At least I'm open to new concepts!
God!
How are you?
Oh, nothing much.  You know...
Have you?
Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?
Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  I don't know why it would.
No, I haven't.
You're kidding me.
Oh, I'm fine.
Oh, well, God, I can imagine what you wrote.
Oh, well.
It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great.
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
Oh, wow!
It was just great.  Uh, I was all set...I was set to be bored stiff.
I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.
Sure.  Sure, uh, yes.
When'd you get here?
Thanks.
I'm going to tell you later....
To <u>show</u>...  in my ability to <u>squander</u>.  What one might deem an <u>advantage</u>... that my <u>strength</u> is greater than <u>yours</u>...
Well.  Word gets around.
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
We got a bunch of <u>materials</u>, coming up at auction.  Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his <u>books</u>.
And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.
...aren't you afraid of me...?
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
You want to get married...?
And who is "they?"
How crazy is that.
Brigham.  Go.  Affirmative.  Okay, Happiness is a Green Light.  We've got Evelda in the kitchen, cooking.  The dope's D.E.A.  <u>We</u> want her on Interstate Transportation of some firecrackers.  Starling:  you've got Drumgo, you know her from before.
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
...nightmare.
Yeah, so where is he?
Impossible.
You take this much time over everything?
I like Popcorn...
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
You give me whatever I want...?
He... would consider it a favor if he could make a <u>donation</u>.  To a charitable institution of your choice. 
We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.
....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
Come on, stay with us.  Look here:  I could get behind you, and give you a <u>spinal</u>, tomorrow, you wuunt feel <u>anything</u> down there, a l'il <u>pulling</u> is all.  N'I'll tell you <u>what</u>, after he's got his jollies, ten, f'teen minutes, I'll come down here, give you a shotta <u>this</u>  stop your heart, an that's <u>you</u> done, an there's an <u>end</u> to it.  What do you say...?  I know you got lotsa money, evabody says so.  I know how that stuff works, take it out, move it <u>around</u>...  ...stay with me now, <u>fuss</u> with it... Whatsay we call your banker now, tell him a <u>code</u>... move that money to me, he <u>confirms</u> it, and I fix you up Right Now...  Whatsay?
...unmarked hundreds....
For a consideration.
I am all attention.
Well, well, well, well, well, she went <u>in</u> there, to apprehend a Dangerous Felon. Went in there with her gun, Came out, <u>without</u> the Felon, with<u>out</u> the gun...
I think that's... {HE STARTS TO RISE, AND THE MEETING BEGINS TO BREAK UP) Starling, I'm sure these gentlemen...
She was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  And...
Waited too long, hon...?  
You know it?
I have had many excellent meals there.
How wonderful of you, to hold that information in your <u>busy</u> mind...
I'm not a scholar, Dottore.  But it seemed as if they, as if they...
Do you like it at your home, Franklin?
...and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.
You find something objectionable to working in partnership with....
Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
I came to pay my...
...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...
Can you walk?  Are your legs working...?
And how did he do that?
Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest Crime.  The Greatest crime.  Perhaps the <u>only</u> crime.  <u>I</u> never ceased to hope!
...when I... 
Our Mister <u>Frendler</u> to, to, to humiliate me, though....
Yeah, well, it's a raw wound, innit, you're gonna bump it, every time you turn around... but you know what the <u>trick</u> is...?
You're going to <u>do</u> that?
What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?
...what...?
Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.
...and that is what you need to expand.
We are here on sufferance.  I am here...
No.  Invite us?  No, he simply...
Because...?
...what a lovely perfume.
What're they on about?
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
I'll bet you're glad I waited until the last day to have this conversation.
Uh, yeah, that's...wow.
What are you gonna do about it?
That would be a No.
Wendy, don't be afraid to get a little stupid and contagious. The kids don't understand that this is our summer, too. We shouldn't have to put our lives on hold to be their butlers.
You'll be hiding behind a tree.
Talia, just because you happen to be Jewish, doesn't mean you can make fun of someone desecrating the Lord's body...
Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to...
Isn't this the time where one of us says something deeply offensive to the other one...We're just so different.
I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.
Oh you know, Bosnia, the importance of the right to vote...
Yes you do.
Fuck off.
Stop!  Stop it, this afternoon was not what you thought...I overheard you and Pixel, at the side of the mess hall, your idea about the "test"...Do you believe me?
Next to "boring," "Sucks" is the most painfully overused word in the current English language. I thought if I could reverse the meaning of "sucks" so it means something positive, I don't know...It would be vaguely revolutionary. It's kind of my social experiment for the summer. "Suck" is historically a nice word-- sno-cones, your mother's...
Two billion years of evolution and                          ] you're what we've come up with--                            ] "Wichita"--the hot, cool, tell-it-                          ] like-it-is counselor with a dark                            ] side.                                                       ]
I don't believe it. I'm winning.
It's not my style, okay?
In my heart, Heather's still alive.
I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you?
Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
What's your damage? Brad says you're being a real cooze.
Where did you get these?
I said I was sorry.
God Veronica, drool much? His name's Jason Dean. He's in my American History.
But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?
The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?
I don't really like your friends either.
Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.
Did you miss him completely?
Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes.
She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
Get off my bed, you sick psycho! You think you're a rebel! You're not a rebel! You're a sick psycho! Do you think you're a rebel? Do you think you're a rebel? I wanna know!
It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.
How do you turn the fucker off?
I thought I...you..
We on tonight man?
That pudwapper just stepped on my foot.
I think so, man.
I got a confession to make. My name used to be Heather, too.
Mummy has a special technique called "Deep Therapy."
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
This story of yours-maybe the school newspaper will print it when it's finished.
and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
Can I go now?
You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!
These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
I don't wanna be in bloody school!
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
is bending down, pulling a tray of sausage rolls into the oven. Both girls look at HONORA silently.
Fruit.
0h, God . . . I'm so sorry!
I wish James would do a religious picture . . . he'd be perfect as Jesus!
You'll never guess what's happened!!
How do you know? Did he tell you?
I can try my father's safe. I'm sure I can get the keys to his office.
It's a three-act story with a tragic end.
These hallucinations I'm having. I think they're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way.
Of course, yes.
Skin cancer.
Eighty third most common.
You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
Hospital? You haven't been to the hospital since uh...
Yeah? You and who else?
Ambrose. I know.
In a word? Lucrative.
Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your head healed okay by now?
What evidence?
Okay how many fingers am I holding up?
Poor Trevor.
All you've got is the here and the now Trevor. That's all anyone really has. Maybe this will make things easier to understand. A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. And at the end of the day does it even matter? All these events you're describing. How can you be sure any of them really happened?
I don't even know what's real and what isn't how can I trust anyone?
Are you ready?
I'm kinda feeling nuts myself!
Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!
They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?
Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
Huh?  Whadda you mean?
What's going on?  "Guilty"!  What is this?
A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
It's November.
Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse.  The D.A. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail...
I took a loan on my car and my computer.
You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?
I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
Ev, it's not my fault!  I'm trying to tell you this incredible --
Is he here, your friend.  The fireman?
A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
Are you gonna take me somewhere next weekend?
Listen, buddy, I'm really enjoying this relationship we got going here. I been missing out on not knowing you better.  Thing is, I got all this business stuff...
Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars.  I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect...
Is she... serious?  A half a million dollars?  In my behalf?
This guy LaPlante won an award?
You said all the passengers were accounted for...
We're piecing together different accounts and...
Upset!  What's he upset about?
You were in bed.  Weren't you?
Hi, Chief.  You like the suicide?
I haven't won it yet.  I notice you've got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony.
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
I didn't ask him.
Let's watch some TV.
Oh, it's nothing.  No problem. I was really lucky to find this place.
All right then.  That's important, isn't it?  -- For you to be in an "up" environment.  I'm saying you should literally take that as your <u>base</u>, do you know what I mean? It's something positive that you've accomplished -- even if you were forced by circumstance -- something for you to build upon.
Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
You must value your independence.
C'mon, kids, let's go.
Honey --
What?
What if someone else buys it in the meantime?
We're going to think about it.
-- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is?  Some nice neighborhood.
I mean, he's a smart kid, he'll get by -- he takes after me. You're too sensitive.
You'll see that there's really much more space than the average three bedroom.
Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
I thought I was supposed to stay in my room.
And this -- is the master bedroom.
It's a double.
Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?
Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing.
I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.
For Chrissake!  Gimme a break.  The guy disappears for seven years and as soon as he comes back it starts again.
She was a good woman.
No.
The days of magic are ending.  The world is changing.
That's all?
Thank you, Thomas.
I'm sure they will.
That is a thought that doesn't please me.
To ask her to dance.
I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
No.  What am I to do?
We had a bargain.  You promised.
Then take me with you.
Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side?
I remember you.
Corpses?
Yes.  We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.
I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
Where did you get it?
What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
Because it's my name.
Yes.
That makes you uncomfortable?
Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--
I've seen it.
They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.
What's that next to him?
Incredible.  The cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds.  It's a remarkable duplication.
It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years?
That's what the Kurgan said.
You know it's not safe here for you.
You kept it?
Why?
Do not underestimate the power of your heart.  Your dreams live there.
This check is for sixteen thousand dollars.  That's a lot of cash to be carrying around.
And by doing so, he would've known we have spies in his organization.
Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place?
I understand.
Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him.
Who sent you?
There's fuckin' blood all over you!
Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!
That's why we gotta keep going.  I'm not gonna go in for murder.
We're on foot.  We can't get away.
Then we might as well die rich.
You with the cops?
How about the cop?
Hey, Dennis?  Can I let you in on a personal secret?
The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis.
You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me?
Who else is here?
Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
Find something:  Extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight.
Can you identify this man?
Talley lives here.  I don't know if the place has security or not.
Give me an ETA.
You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not <u>talk</u> to them; <u>have</u> them.
Why don't you guys grab some dinner at the Thai place?  I'll meet you there as soon as I can.
You sure?
Mine, too.
Thanks for the shirt.
Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get your brother, then come back for you. We'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?
What are we going to do about Mike?
Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that.  Put a unit out there.
You have her cell number?
I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!
We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.
It's right in front of us.
The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.
I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?
Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He <u>kills</u> people!
Dennis hit him.  His head's all big and he won't wake up.  I'm really scared.
That's on the second floor.  Could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you?
I've got the boy on the phone.  He's using a cell phone.  What was that, son?  I didn't hear you.
That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks.
Marlon and Al....
These disks . . . where are they?
Paul, we would like to speak to you in your office.
Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
How much?
How many in your family?
You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.
Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all.
Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
They fired a rocket at us.
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
The United Nations are still here.
The Americans! Who are they to put us on trial. Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. Then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders ‘we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us.’ What do you think would have happened? No different.
I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
Where are they going?
I am going to do you a great favor.  I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.
We are better here.
You lie.
You will tell them the truth.
A bargain buy, from China. Ten cents each, I'll get a dollar.
Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
The fifth room is your broadcast room.
Gregoire it is good to see you back to work.
Please, except my humblest apologies...
Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier. What is this?
Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies everywhere. I cannot stay here.
Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
Move? Where to?
The third floor are low class rooms.
They should go one truck at a time. When the first truck gets through to the airport, then the others will follow.
Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time?
Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.
Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?
I couldn't help.
He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
Oh, my God!
Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore.
What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
I have to go out to get food.
In Ruhengeri?
I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali.
It was substantial.
Tell me what it was.
I want to know.
We have to get out of here Tatiana.
A little longer, Paul?
Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
Rutaganda's place?
It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.
Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract attention to yourself.
Thank you, sir.
When?
Out? Where are you going?
All. What do you mean all?
The staff, the guests.
Why the hurry, Roger?
I don't know.
Take a bow, Steven, you've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me.
-- bullshit --
You're not my list.
I'm sorry --
-- what was he doing here?
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
Uhhhh...
Pritchett, is that you?
-- the stained glass --
I was upstairs with Eddie --
-- that's the fact, bud --
-- you lose either way, Price --
Could we have a word?
I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?
I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.
It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.
-- just not always in the sexual sense.
Now, there's the simple country gal I married. Let's go back down and greet your guests -- show them the real you: corny as Kansas on the Fourth of July.
Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.
And where are we off to, Mr. Price? Check the wiring on the animatronic Mummies?
Evelyn... Get up... NOW!
Messenger just dropped it off. No return address.
First time for everything.
I think...I may have the answer.
He was right! Pritchett was right!
-- the window and door grates --
Houston, I think we may have a problem.
I mean, not that it didn't give Evelyn the kind of coronary I had in mind, just...
Uh, excuse me? Don't think I'm not having the time of my life watching this train wreck that's your marriage -- but this isn't what I had in mind... I want to know that we can get out of here if we need to.
This? This is nothing. You've only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you're tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then...  ...Bye, bye, Miss American Pie...
He must've unsealed the room!
Damn it.
It will heal.
I'm sorry.
Can we leave out a bowl of milk, mommy?
Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen?
Where is she now?
What's he doing daddy?
Mommy!
I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.
I just, I don't know...
I wish I knew more about her.
...set up some more things.
The heater's here.
Well, I try to keep an open mind, but...
Who?
It doesn't matter to me.  What do you mean by that?
Do you think I'm a fool?
She attended the church for years. A dear woman, it was sad to see her decline so rapidly.
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
What?
There's something through that wall!
What will he do?  What does he want?
Wha .... ?
Yeah.  Sure.  You mean ... tonight?
Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...
I put some decaf on.  Er ... make yourself comfortable.
What?
Sure.  Why?
It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony- bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.
Can we see?
Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
Wow.  Thank you.
Yes.
Don't flee from yourself.  If you have a quality, let it define you.  Cultivate it.  It is you.  By helping me, you will help yourse...
You see, we're not so dissimilar.
No.  I mean, really?  Because I'm concerned for you, sweetheart.  I care about you.  I guess I miss you.  I'm sorry we split up.  I'm sorry I ...
I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you.
No.  But, as you can see, I'm having some work done on it.  You found a real treasure for me, Terri.  I hope I can show you how grateful I am.
Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
Well, forget about it.  Hawk and I are going to Rio.  We're hurt, we're tired, and a hero ain't nothing but a sandwich.  Right, buddy?...
That's your definition of "Hard?"
Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me."
Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?
I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?
I'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers. Goddamn Gates.  Goddamn Rutherford Auction House.  By the way, how many seconds?
The song's over!  Come on! "You could be swinging on a star."
Boing.  Uh, this I don t understand...
I'm a ghost.  Boo.
Welcome back to Vinci.
A little petting is not the issue!
God, I wish I could say the same thing.  What about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight. Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes, Anecdotes about famous dead Italians....
Let's just say, I never saw E.T.
Somebody robbed the Vatican.
You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum.
Cat got his tongue?
Hawkmeister, we got you clothes, great hotel, and a 250,000 lira per diem.
We want Da Vinci's sketchbook, what do they call it, the Codex.
I look at you Soviet people and I feel... pity... superiority.  Most of your life, your government has told you that Capitalism turns people into robots who'd rather eat microwave sushi, naked in the back of a Cadillac than hear the laughter of children.
Why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? Especially after I got you such a nice job.
The auction house, asshole.  One night's work and you're free like no ex-con's ever been.  No checking in with a shrink, no community service teaching retards how to play air hockey. It's a great deal, I can't lie.
I hate a man with a sense of humor.  While you corn dogs were comparing the lengths of your masculinity, we obtained the helicopter the new fashioned way: a thoroughly corrupt business deal.
But I'm not the type of guy to hold a grudge.
Why does this have to be so hard...
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!
Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger!
What a horrible little person.
Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
-- these were the values that were instilled in me while I was growing up in a little town you've probably never heard of --
Oh, no, really, I --
I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.
Your i --
Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after --
I tell ya the guy's a phony.
Yeah, well, monkey or not I'm still editor of this rag. Amy, I thought you were doing that piece on the F.B.I. -- J. Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry?
Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
Watch it, Archer --
Just got hired today!
This I know, Benny.
Oh, uh... Buzz... Is it important?
Yeah, but, buddy --
But, buddy --
But, Buzz, you know I never --
Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must've mislaid --
Sir?
That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.
Well, I made the dean's list.
Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!
...Congratulations, kid, you've really outdone yourself. Reinvented the wheel. I'm going to recommend to the Board that we proceed immediately with this, uh... with the, uh... that the dingus be mass-produced with all deliberate speed. Of course, as president of the company the ultimate decision is yours.
Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud.
Ya get the special?
She isn't!
That's nonsense, Alma.
No.  She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica.  But the Houngan cured her.
Thank you, Mrs. Rand.  I think you're every bit as nice as Wes says you are.
-- and when my husband died I felt helpless. They disobeyed me -- things went from bad to worse. All my husband's dreams of good health, good sanitation, good morals for these sweet and gentle people seemed to die with him.  Then, almost accidentally, I discovered the secret of how to deal with them. There was a girl with a baby -- again and again I begged her to boil the drinking water. She never would. Then I told her the god, Shango, would be pleased and kill the evil spirits in the water if she boiled it. She boiled the water from then on.
But you didn't have to come up here.
She can never be cured?
They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital.  I had my suspicions, though, about the Directress of Training.
I don't know.  He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
Where do you think you're going?
It's my day off.
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
That doesn't sound like him.
She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
It is not beautiful.
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
You didn't find your patient so frightening in the daylight, did you?
Good morning, Miss Connell.
Well, I had a good time up to a point.
Still, I feel you should remove the decanter.  Wes is not an alcoholic yet, Mr. Holland. But as a nurse I can tell you that it won't be long before he is.
I've been waiting here for hours, trying to imagine Jessica well again -- wondering what I'd feel. I could see Jessica as she used to be, I could hear her say in that sweet mocking voice, "Paul, darling..."  The whole thing beginning all over again...
I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort.  I thought they might cure her.
Because you wanted to give my wife back to me?  Why should that mean anything to you?
I still can't believe it Paul -- that you wouldn't say a word in your own defense.
I hated myself.  I kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a Zombie.
Yes, I said it, and I made myself believe it. But when I got here, Jessica was already raging with fever.
Well, gonna make a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy.
That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.
Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat.
You think I --
I have no idea.
I'm not surprised.
In the car.
Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
Damn it, Ben --
I'll drive you --
Do you think? Maybe we should call someone --
The phone's out.
Well dad, actually I thought I'd take the morning train on Thanksgiving -- got a lot of studying, papers, you know, lab experiments --
Anyone special? You know...
See you.
Here.
Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are.
A prior engagement overcame me.
Fascist!
Good-night dad.
... while children in Africa and Asia are napalmed and --
Huh?
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.
Advice? I'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben. Unless - have you quit your job? They fired you?
-- Your mother, God bless her, stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - I assume you're talking here about divorce? The very thought --
-- What advice? You never --
It's not the taxes I object to. It's all the fines and penalties.
That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.
Good shit.
Hello you two. Am I barging in on some kind of religious study group? Elena, you look marvelous. Will I see you and Ben at the Halford's?
You want coffee or something?
Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You must think I'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows.
Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt.
Educated guess.
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --
See ya.
Huh?
Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
Frankie opens them with his teeth.
You know Libbets, I really feel, you know, like a real connection to you --
It's like very positive, and I feel a real special feeling, because you really --
I'm in love with Libbets Casey.
Yeah?
Geometry?
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.
Communist Viet Cong.
Want a drink?
Have you ever had a nocturnal emission?
Huh?
And then I lost him.  In the fog.
You did your homework, Officer.
But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
Typical seventeen year-old.  She went to a party Friday night?
Not really.
He would have liked that.
What are you doing here?
Eight years.
When's that, a week?  Two weeks?...  We have to figure out a plan of action now.
Fred Duggar?
I'm not expecting anyone.
That's not what he thinks.
She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
You don't know.
Thought I smelled something.
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
You want me to take you somewhere?
I'm sorry?
But you wanted to.
Yes.
Randy Stetz is in jail.
You mean we are not children of Satan?
I understand. I saw you in the theatre, your suffering, your sympathy for that girl. I saw you with the boy. You die when you kill, you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing. But does that make you evil? Or, since you comprehend what you call goodness, does it not make you good?
No, my beloved, my child.
You said there were none.
You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.
No.
More.
I'm not your daughter.
I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
But now's the time to end it, Louis. Now's the time to leave him.
Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he have liked, Louis?
You want me to be your daughter forever, don't you?
She's no vampire.
He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.
That's not so.
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
I can't go through with it, I tell you.
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
You're sure?
And if I don't?
What have you done to me? You've condemned me to hell.
Lestat, she's alive!!!!
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
I tried...
So shall we begin?  What do yo do?
See? I knew you were interesting. You mean this literally, I take it?
What about coffins?
Can a vampire feel love?
It's over, I'm telling you...
You promise to care for her then?
Look at the gaslight. Don't tke your eyes off it. You will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive. Do you hear me?
You're in 201 and 202.
You'll go away with you're college friends, but you won't go away with me?
That was heart attack time, Karla.
Yeah, right -- whatever.
Say yes.
He's not coming. I thought he was just...
Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.  And I don't want to have to say I told you so...
No way.
No.
I know I don't want to stay in here.
I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood.
I'm holding your hand!
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
Who?
It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
I'm sorry.
What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
He's in it with Willis?
Oooh, the mainland --
Hello?
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
Well, I'm in school and --
Rio de Janeiro!
Must have missed the sign.
I'm just saying what all of you are thinking. It's bad enough gettin' rained out without having to hold her hand the whole time.
Take this.
We'll only be a second, okay?
How clover you are, Mr. Albrecht, to see all that in our simple Thea... She is quite pretty, isn't she?
I'd like to, very much -- but it depends on what dispatches are waiting for me on the mainland.
All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
She's right. This is hardly the time to bandy old tales.
I suppose you want to hear my prayer to Hermes.
No.  She shall not be left here.
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
Miss Wollsten shares the room with you?
Thea -- you're hiding something. Why do you suddenly speak of your father? You told me once you had never seen him -- didn't know him --
You should sleep, Cathy. Lie down and close your eyes. Try to forget everything.
Suppose, she isn't dead. Suppose it was a cataleptic attack?
You were father's secretary -— I never thought - -
I've always known what an evil mind lay behind that pretty weak face of yours —— but this, Cathy -- even I would never have believed it is of you.
Would you care to explain what you're talking about?
I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure —- quite sure.
Her name is Thea?
You know that sound, Oliver?
But the war, the army —— they need you.
We still don't know that it's the plague ——
You are my friend.
You're crying. Why?
I can't.
Why in the world can't you?
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.
Who?
George . . .
Stand back.
Good morning, sir.
Yeah, very funny.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the . . .
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What . . . are you a hypnotist?
No, of course not.
Clarence . . .
I want the Board to know that George gave up his trip to Europe to help straighten things out here these past few months. Good luck to you at school, George.
Hello, Joseph, trouble?
Zuzu –– Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?
Big –– see! I don't want one for one night. I want something for a thousand and one nights, with plenty of room for labels from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand . . . a great big one.
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
Well then, how do you know?
Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone. I know what you're feeling. I won't ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I won't.
Hope you have a good trip, George. Uncle Billy and I are going to miss you.
I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
Oh . . .
Father, did I act like that when I graduated from high school?
Maybe you were born older, George.
What do you mean, and be bored to death?
Hello, Violet.
Hello, Georgie-Porgie.
Where are you going?
Old Building and Loan pal, huh . . .
Pop!
They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
Me?
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it.
In that place?
What'd you wish, George?
Tuesday.
Where'd you get that dress?
Where are we going?  Look at this. There's the kitty, Ernie. Here, come on, count it, Mary.
Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for.
Hi.
Is it snowing?
Yeah, just started.
Mary! Mary!
Well, then . . it's usually customary to bring the money with you.
Wheee!  Faster!
We're carrying weight.
I don't know.
N-o-o-o-o-o-o....
What is it?  What's there?
I never heard of a 908.
I just made it up.  It means, "Get me out of there."  What the hell's that?
In here.
No place special.  Just hanging out.
I don't know about him -- I'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing.
Mike?  Is that you?
Let's see -- you got a minute?
Too late, it's written.
It came up during the meeting.
Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.
Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
The Shark's mouth.
Carcharadon Carcharias.
That's it.
Where the hell were you?
Mrs. Silvera?
That's what I said.  Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
Use the little brush there.  Why were you at Santos'?
Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
The goddamn smell is always the same. 
Are you going to be able to sleep?
What'd I say?
They have no right to treat you like that.  You've given them every- thing.  For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island....
Hello, hello.  It went well, I thought.
Very impressive ceremony.  Good speech.
I'm showing summer rentals.  We got a helluva season going.
We're alone.
Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.
Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke.
A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
Martin, could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something?
10-4, in a few minutes.  He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.
There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way.  Turn them back to port.
That's it?
10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!
That's what he said.
Waiting for Andy.
Mike!  Are you going out?
No class.
What about the others?
I'm not sure I can.
It'll be fun, come on!
Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the town beach....
I thought you were grounded.
Uh.  Well.  Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in....
Who wouldn't.
I want Fruit Loops!
Take me.
I want to go with you!
Quiet!  Shhh!
Look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home.
You should've been out there.  You should've seen him waving that gun, like a maniac.  There were shots fired!
Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to make a buck like anybody else.
So?  So?
I'll need more men to look.
They're acting very strange suddenly.
Honey, I gotta go.
Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.
... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.
They're coming with us?
What's wrong?
You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?
Fine piece of engineering.
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
Change your mind?
You want me to stay?
No, we'll go through here.
Put it under your pillow and sleep on it and the tooth fairy will --
I am.  You're not.
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
Well, I have to get this into the networks.  If you can't do it, you can't do it, that's all.
I think we can capture it.  I'd like to try.
You look like an orange worm.
Afraid I can't do that.
Not at all.
We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.
I knew it;  it's my fault.  We moved it too soon.
'Course they're also so rich.
Herpes?
Not for me.  I don't go in the water, remember?
Now what's this do?
No...  It can't be.
Take it up!
The space shuttle has landed!
What're you doing later?
Remember, skiers stay up longer.
Now what?
No, South Georgia.
What the hell's there?
In a restaurant.  You sit there and they swim around you.
Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?
That bugger moves fast.
Give me a 400-foot magazine;  we may be down there for a while.
Close the door.
She could have been killed...You knew and you didn't tell us...You let your mother think....
I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....
Beginning of what?
Give it some time, Ellen...See what happens.
Maybe he's got good taste...I don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you....
Stop what?
I want you to give up that terrible job.
Hey, come on, you can't believe that voodoo.  Sharks don't commit murder. They don't pick out a person....
It picked Sean...It killed your father....
That's it?  Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne....
I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little.  It'll work out....
You looked just like your father... The first time the shark came to Amity....
Can you just go off...?
Flies the plane....
Depends on where you want to go....
I can't....
Sure you can....
Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
What say we get the hell out of here, Ellen Brody. ...
Matt?
We'll be done pretty soon....
Inch by inch....
Feathers all over the place....
The readings suck....
I made them, man....
Maybe I missed you too....
Forget it....
When I invited you...
What?
I've got about a half dozen...I'm going to tag them.  You hearing anything?
It's my turn in the barrel, man....
I don't like it....
Nothing...Hey Michael...You know I was thinking about yesterday.  Maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....
How come only me?
Listen to Carla...Marry me...I'm tall, dark and handsome...two out of three ain't bad....
I just want to make an honest woman of you....
Manage the whole damn place some day. I'm looking forward to living in the style to which I would like to become accustomed....
That bad, huh?
You have the safety talk at school, one o'clock tomorrow....
Where's Lenny?
Cow tipping?
Not for me ..
It's an "unsolved." They spent 500 thousand dollars & bought emselves a dead end - You might wanna check it with Taylor, he worked the case.
Thank Christ we got a witness.
No, you didn't.
What are you doing, Ross? I've had that 15 years! ..
You looked like you did?
No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day.
You gotta stop calling Los Angeles .. You're dragging L.A. around with you like an addiction.  Look at the shit you're putting yourself through? For what? For <u>nothing</u>, I know it, I been there. Remember me? Up to my asshole in anger, living off the vitamins in cigarettes?  If there's a body under the snow, <u>fuck</u> <u>it</u>. Let somebody else worry about it. You gotta accept you stopped living in that world, & try and give yourself a break in this ..
I'm not in here to apologize, John. I told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? "Good-bye, Princess," & the same night she gets attacked? That's a tough one to swallow, Bro?
I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
Well .. I didn't know that ..
Jesus. What are you doin?
Bits.
What if we need a back up?
What is that?
You're pushing this too hard. It's like you <u>want</u> me to say <u>stop</u>? You must know that's the way this is going, John? There's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little?
We have a multiple homicide, Sir ..
Three or four.
<u>You</u> put it in there.
You don't know what you done, Taylor.
I've heard you call him Freddy.
No.
What are you reading?
Hamlet. Have you read it?
Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"
You said, you were in the bad lands?
You're looking more worried now than when you "decided to stop worrying"?
He don't know that. I didn't.
He doesn't need my help.
You don't wanna sit here any more, sweetheart ..
Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about ..
What was she like?
Is that Margie?
No it isn't .. It's Californian ..
Damn A, it's O.K. With a bit of luck I'm goin home. What we got?
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
Who told you?
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --
Look, I don't want a --
No one has ever dumped me.
You hear those courtesy laughs, Jerry? There is a seething wrongness at the edges of this party.
No no...
Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait.
Well, I'm happy for you.
Well.
Yeah, I did.
Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
Well, good evening.
Good.  Good.  Glad is good.
I sunk most of what I had into this condo, which devalued, and --
Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
What --
Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.
You want...
This used to be my specialty. I was good in a living room.  Send me in there, I'll do it alone. And now I just... I don't know... but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life, it wasn't complete, wasn't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete, because I couldn't share it with you.  I couldn't hear your voice, or laugh about it with you.  I missed my wife.  We live in a cynical world, and we work in a business of tough competitors, so try not to laugh --  I love you.  You complete me.
I heard.
No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
That's the girl I love.
I've got a 24 hour a day reminder of Roger, for the rest of my life. I have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours I might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath.  Look at me, Laurel, look at me.  I'm the oldest 26 year old in the world!  How do I look?
Forgot your keys --
No, Roy.  I'm not gonna cry.
Mmm.  Hmm.
Yes.
You love me now, don't you?
Rod --
Huh?
Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance.
Dude, know your art form.  If you put the camera down here, looking up, I look more powerful.  There's no need for a camel... you got ME.
How do I know?
I'm a little worried --
I'm sorry I asked.
Damn right.
What --
Jerry Maguire.  SMI.
--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
Exactly.  And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.
Which they do.  And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me." And I took out the ring, and I don't much like big scenes, but she said "yes" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.  We're getting married in February.
Marcee.  How's my favorite player's wife?
You okay?
You...
Let's go the zoo.
What's going on, Jerry?
Now go kiss your daddy, quick.
What?
Nothing.
That's him. That’s Eric!
Eric! Are you here?
This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.
You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low.
You had the phone the whole time?
He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island.  Right?
We'll be broke in four weeks.
That does sound lucky.
Listen Alan, I really appreciate you bringing me along.
NO!
He used to know me.
What did you think?
Why?
That's hard to believe.
There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?
Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help.
Sorry.  We were saying?
Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics.
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
Resentful.
That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.
I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
"InGen."  What's InGen?
Cancel that, Dieter.
How close do you have to be?
What is that?
It's... behind... us.
Then this is our chance.
But why?
You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.  And they asked him, "why did you go up there to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I went up there to live."
You know, even if we do get those tapes back, people are going to say it's just another hoax.  Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy.
Ian's a very good friend of mine.
Hold it down, Nick!
I found a way to re-route through the program.  I'm turning the cars around in the rest area loop.
We're talking, my dear, about a calculated risk, which is the only option left to us.  We will never find the command NEDRY used.  He covered his tracks far too well, and I think it's obvious he's not coming back.  So shutting down the system - -
Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?
How many lines of code are there?
Pretty sure.
Did I say jerk?
Fascinating animals, fascinating.
But with this place, I - - I wanted to give  them something real, something that wasn't an illusion, something they could see and  touch.  An aim devoid of  merit.
Once we have control again we - -
But you know, I should  really be the one going .
The Cretaceous.
- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
Ellie - - get back and boot up the door locks!
They show extreme intelligence, even problem solving. Especially the big one.  We bred eight originally, but when she came in, she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others.  That one - -when she looks at you, you can see she's thinking  working things out.  She's the reason we have to feed 'em like this. She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.
What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!
Come on, let's go.
Uh - - thumb!  The same way.
Alan, listen to this.
No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!
Can we chance moving him?
I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
Let's get something straight, John.  This is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.  Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned.  Forty-eight hours from now, if they - -  - -aren't convinced.  I'm not convinced.  And I can shut you down John.
Yes it is.
Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.
Their radio's out too.  Gennaro said to stay put.
Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
I didn't say I was scared.
Hey, we were saving that!
And who in God's name do you think you are....?
I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
Tim!  Lex!
Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant!
John doesn't subscribe to Chaos, particularly what it has to say about his little science project!
A load, if I may say so. of fashionable number crunching, that¹s all it is!
I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
I think perhaps I'll just sit down.  I don't suppose you think all that much of me now, do you?
That will teach you to trust Grandpa.
Well?
I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - -
No, no, sh, sh, sh - - stop!  Stop! Stop!  Don't let the monsters come over here!
Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years?
And do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks Crystal Lake is filled with corpses?
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
I really think we should go back...
Hello?
Oh my god... this is his house... _we're in his fucking house_...
I can't wait to hear your opening argument.	"Ladies and Gentlemen	of the Jury... the Defense will prove that Jason Voorhees did not kill all of these people. They, in fact, committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard..."
What happened?
That's right... it... it came right out of his chest...
Are you going to plead insanity?
You think that's going to work?
You watch this garbage?
Oh?
This is bad, Joe. The Prosecution is already putting together a team of psychiatric specialists. They'll argue exactly the opposite. They'll say he's just pretending to be catatonic and he's completely sane.
None of that's true?
Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.
Insomnolesence...
How long will he need to be asleep?
I think I'm onto something, Joe.
He was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called Springwood about eight miles from here.  Guess what his murder weapon was? A glove with six-inch blades.
Fascinating.
I don't suppose I can go back to the University and chase young coeds again... pretend this whole thing never happened...
Then I'd say we should put Jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. We'll get extra data this time. Video... infrared... the works.
So Krueger thinks Jason's dead... leaves him in the lake... but the boy actually wakes up on the shore... crawls off into the woods... where he lives the rest of his life alone.
I don't know... but I think he's pissed.
You know how to use one of those?
And if he's not?
Ten minutes...
What happened? Where's Jason?
You work in the insurance department?
Where do you live?
My assistants, I presume.
I read the one about the penal colony.
Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
The Castle gates were blockaded in the time of the great plague -- it's an escape route.  Don't get stuck.
It's my last and final one.
Did you see him?
He's usually in the storage room sorting things out.  He can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.
Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?
I usually take lunch by the River.
In a small way.
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
When I have no reason to doubt.
Are you free tonight?
That street down there -- I always used to call it the approach road for suicides.  It leads straight down to the bridge and the River.
Gabriela! -- you did get away.
When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
No, we said goodbye outside the building.  He went off, as usual, toward his house.
Where you've been employed for seven years.
He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.
Can I ask -- how you found me?
That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.
My assistants.  I should have known. Nothing is given to me.  I have to acquire everything.
... Why take me into your confidence?
All these in the last year?
You must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in.  It wouldn't have been so bad, but even the Medical Officer for the district was killed!
Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss.
They keep switching us from department to department.  He doesn't mind because he can't sit still.
Am actually laying my hand on the twenty-five foot gorilla.Ladies and gentlemen! I am touching the beast!
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
I'm sorry ...
Yeah! Life's looking pretty damn good at the moment.
I can't imagine you crying.
Jack!
I'm chartering this vessel,Engelhorn - how many days?
They' re dead.
Man Eater!!!
Hey! I thought these things were supposed to be extinct!
They were just tasting the berries.
Uh uh.
Don't belong?
No.
Why isn't he locked up?
Is that why Klute didn't tell me?
Like for you to look for the man.
You have no idea what I'm talking about.
If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
What?  What do you remember about that -- dumper?
-- you perverted hypocrite square bastards.
You've changed your mind? You do want to play?
Is there anything more I could --
Well --
It's kind of late.
Not much point to this, is there?
Bree -- thanks -- I don't want to.
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time.
Why couldn't you stay here with me?
I got a call from Ross this morning. Cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends. They found Tom Grunemann's body buried there. They've notified his wife.
What?
Yeah.
I'm on my way to Chicago. Very important meeting tonight. Well -- any new developments?
You said Trask was arranging laboratory work. Police laboratory. Anything from that?
Some mistake perhaps that --
Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients?
Well --
Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
Thank you. Goodbye, John.
OK, a family matter. Between the girls. I had two other cows --  -- two other girls besides Bree.
You don't tell them. That one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them?  Peace in the family.  Beyond that, I don't know. All she wrote.
Not unusual.
You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant?
I'm Dr. Alvarez, Judge Atkins asked me to look in on your son and prepare an evaluation sheet.
Where is the child?
What does?
The prospect of losing my child.
In real life when does he hit you?
Ladies and gentlemen...
Huh?...Oh God...What time is it?
You forgot the milk.
Billy, don't eat with your fingers.
No I didn't.  I hate the brown stuff.  It's gross.
There, okay? Now that's just plain old hamburger.
Some of the brown stuff is still there.
Uh huh?
Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite...
Billy.   This is Dr. Alvarez. She would like to talk to you.
Objection.
Uh, huh?
Was there apple juice when you were little?
Bigger than a principal.  The judge sits in robes in a big chair.. The judge has thought a lot about us, about you and me and your mom, and he has decided...  ...he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom Joanna in her apartment.  And I'm very lucky.  Because even though you'll live with your mom Joanna I'll get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month.
Objection!
Did you wish to?
So do I.
Eight, almost nine years.
And how did you find his work?
No.
Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?
Did he ever fail to provide for you?
I don't recall.
I...I don't know...
Whom you've seen twice in a year? Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband, wasn't he the longest personal relationship in your life?
I suppose...
Oh?  What do you call it then --a success?  The marriage ended in divorce.
I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
You want what?!
Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--
Listen, don't let it get you down.  You're going to be fine.
I don't know, Jim.  This whole thing has happened so...Pow-- like that.
All right, Jim.  You said I was running this show, right? You said no decisions without my approval, right?  Well what the hell is this? What's going on, Jim?
Well, ah...I thought it over and I decided we're doing it Murray's way.
Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being.  Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.
No.  No, I don't believe it. Jim O'Connor would never let anything like that happen.  He gave me my shot in this business. If it wasn't for Jim O'Connor I'd be--I don't know where I'd be. He's a wonderful man...
Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby.
Yeah?
And?
Ted?  They've set the court date. I just heard today...It's...  January sixth.
Yeah.
How the hell are you going to do that?
What?!  She wants what?!
Things? What kind of things?
Two.  She is getting to be a real hermit or recluse or whatever it is you call it.  Thelma, do you know where I could be in this business if I had a wife that entertained or went out socially--
Wait a minute!  Wait a minute!
Uh, huh...Yeah...
Thel, listen to me.  If, on the million to one shot that I should--  That anything should happen to me.  Would you take care of Billy?
You heard anything yet?
Hey, that's terrific.
Please go away, Thel...I...I just have to be by myself for a little while...
All quiet?
Can I free the prisoners?
You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances.
Impossible! You will bring famine down on the people of Tibet with these insatiable demands! More food, the best land for your soldiers to camp.
Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away.
Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.
Yes.
Me. First break of day.
How many?
The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.
Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.
India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
I am scared.
I will not go.
We are now accused of aiding the rebels. The Chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt.
Good day.
We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
I leave tomorrow.
You will always!
Does he have the spot?
He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
What do you think?
You cannot.
Yes.
Am I running away?
Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
No.
Ma'am.  Your husband, Bernie.  You didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded?
'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
Where?  Where?
He was an Indo-pacific.
Eh.  Fuck it.
And how would we neutralize him?
Did you make anything of the tooth?
And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow?
I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
<u>Are</u> you okay?
Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
Thanks for the... bandaid.
Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
It can't work.
He's floating.  Take it home.
Hector!!
If I'm ever in New York...
What's that?
They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
I'll take it!
Thanks for your help.
Did he say anything?
He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
This... how long did this attack go on for?
Not yet.
You're sort of a rude person.
They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.
The tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up.
I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.
Why does everybody insult my intelligence, I have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies.
What is she doing <u>now</u>?  <u>Mother</u> <u>of</u> <u>God</u>.
Kelly.
<u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...
I'm not even a field person.
Wild guess.
<u>You</u>?
Never cock. Just squeeze.
"Desperately random." What does he mean?
Sometimes.
I don't know! Get me out!!
I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.
I understand.
What you're doing, Miss Starling, is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview, and refusing to share information with me. For the third time!
Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico.
But then he had to cover up, make her seem just like all the rest of them. That's what Lecter was hinting!
That wasn't me.
Who's the subject?
Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me?
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
Well? Why aren't you there right now?
Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
Miggs has been murdered.
Why not?
Okay, Starling. Let's have it.
Are you finished?
I don't know. I didn't see those on any of the other girls...
You seem pretty sure of that.
Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
They said she was just rags, like somebody -
Doctor, we have a hard problem in psychological profiling. I want to ask for your help with a questionnaire.
We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.
Oh, Officer Starling... do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?
No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling.
Not anymore.  Surely the odd confluence of events hasn't escaped you, Clarice. Crawford dangles you before me. Then I give you a bit of help. Do you think it's because I like to look at you, and imagine how good you would taste...?
That is both impudent and untrue... Tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our Billy's latest effort?  Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"?
By the book, he's a sadist.
They all were.
Killed outright?
You're very frank, Clarice. I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life.
After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.
Did he try to?
On what basis would they reject him?
I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is.
He kills w-
What is the first and principal thing he does, what need does he serve by killing?
Anger, social resentment, sexual frus-
We don't reckon time the same way, Clarice. This is all the time you'll ever have.
So you ran away...
But you could. You did.
Yes...
You know I can't make that promise.
Better known to his friends as the Death's-head Moth...
Yes, miss.
Your "father"?
Much further?
Listen. Submit. You hear me?  You're strong. You stay alive. I will find you...  no matter how far, how long it takes...
When? How?
Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England...  I am certain of that. More than ever before.  I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts...
Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today.
No.
Any powder?
I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.
You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?
A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's heading south to war against the English. I'm here to raise this county's militia to aid the British defense.
I believe if they set aside their law as and when they wish, their law no longer has rightful authority over us. All they have over us is tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer.  No force on earth will keep me here... Anyone caught leavin' the fort could be shot. So each man make your own decision... Those who are goin', be back here in an hour.
Sir!
I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
Wampum?
What is enough?
British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
Le mot d'ordre?
C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
He did.
And?
Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...
Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
What are you doing?
Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
Okay, number 23's full.
I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.
And it killed Bo?
Two hundred and fifty-two tons of Magnesium and 15 tons of Sodium.
I know that.
Do it.
The man is unbelievable... I say, leave him in there.
So that's all you do?...
Yeah?  How'd the kid hold up?
"Routine," my ass!  Ain't nothin' "routine" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down...especially when we're getting picked up the next day!
Who cares?
What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can't do it.
Burritos...Enchiladas...
Typhoon?!
How'd you do that?
What are you going to do to him?
Bigger than DeJesus?  How?
It would explain the suction- like appendages.
Are you sure you saw something?
Tip top, Willie...tip top.
So how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return?
Is there something we should know about you, Soap?
Well, talk.
Twenty-five from me, Tom, Soap and yourself; a hundred grand to the pound. You don't need to count it.
Bacon, see what we got.
I think he's still alive. He's got claret coming out of him somewhere. What did they want with a traffic warden?
A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.
Like what?
Well you just better un-sell 'em, sharpish.
You fucking well have to get 'em!
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
Son, have a look in his locker.
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
It's not him, Dad.
And the weed?
Invitations?
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
Well, what do you want us to do about it?
Carrying them. They could all be carrying them for what we know.
And look what happened to that.
Well, what's going on?
I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.
Who's this fat man, then?
Tom, this is our case.
Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.
Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course.
What you telling us for? The only thing I care about is whether you get your rest in.
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.
Six.
Twelve.
The money, the gear!
What are you carrying, Willy?
You jerk--
And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
If you had your way I wouldn't have any friends.
It's my life. If I want to fuck it up, that's my business.
I am, sir.
Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--
You're dismissed, Private.
So you knew this young man before?
It's not our job to get involved in your personal life, but when it interferes with the training here--
You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.
How's business?
Yeah, this is Skinny.
Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.
Colt Peacemaker.
So is Buddy on your short list?
You got to investigate. No question about it.
What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old.
Oh. Right. And you're in--?
You still going to all the home games?
Same weight I always was.
No. You?
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.
I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
Spanish in Florida called him Juan Caballo. John Horse.
They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.
Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
Well--
Homework?
Recycling, right? We invented that. The government doesn't have to tell people to do it.
You own this place?
Something like that.
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year.
You know how it is, Colonel--first time away from home, dealing with new people--I remember my first hitch--
You get much of that in here?
Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
Donde esta? Estoy perdido--[Where are you? I'm lost--]
Enrique! Quienes son estos? How could you bring them here?
This girl is a friend of yours?
We have a daughter.
"Fishbait," says Buddy, in that quiet way of his, "What you know about them tires that went missing from markets?" Fishbait thinks for a minute, then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it, "C'mon out, Pooter, they caught us!"
Every other damn thing in the country is called after Martin Luther King, they can't let our side have one measly park?
"Mas cerveza por favor."
I heard there was a bit of a fuss.
There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben--
Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning.
Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
No.
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
We got that dedication tomorrow. This is a hell of a time to be draggin' up old business.
I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.
Sam--
There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail--
All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
I was too busy.
Maybe now. It was different back then. I had this place, I was doing all the shopping, all the cooking. What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?
Thank you.
I never said that.
Okay? He's not here?
I'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other--I should get combat pay--
Buddy was more a part of the big picture--county political machine, chamber of commerce, zoning board if I kept those people happy, he was pretty much on my side.  Whenever somebody thought--they start up another bar for the black  folks, they'd be--how should I put this? They'd be officially discouraged.
What's she singing about?
Enough with the clothes--
Morning, Sheriff.
How much you got left?
So I've heard--
You built our patio while you  were on the county?
I was--I was real sorry about Nando. He was a good fella. We haven't talked since.
No--
I should get back.
Two years.
It isn't. Not by a long shot. He holds her and they lie silently for a moment--
No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to somebody.
Just doing my job.
Don't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just a bit slow, is all. He don't mean nothin' by it--
Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.
What's up?
Hello, L.A.
Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.
I've heard a name.  Someone they talk about in whispers.
I'm sure they'll have this place rigged.
Why?
Billy?  This was on Miller's forehead.  Any idea what it is?
I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
Jesus.  Valentin.  What did you do to your face?
Why did you wait so long?
If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
What is he?
Please... I wasn't there... Ask Pimm.
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
Sorry.  You asked.
They won't tell you anything.
So Swann was performing magic. not illusions?  And what?  You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions.
Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
Nothing?
Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read.
Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
I'm here to offer you a job.
When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
What's the difference?
Are you sure?
Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
Yeah, I know.
No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.
Shit...
Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.
I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...
You don't know the half of it. I'm Walter Wilder, by the way.
He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
That's what they call the Repository.  Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room.
Have you been in?
How the fuck do you do that?
I did it for Dorothea.
And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
Oh Jeez.
Didn't know you read minds.
No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...
They got here before us.
That's where we're all going.
This is where we killed him.
The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.
Is he the Puritan?
Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.
Can you get me on a flight Thursday night?
Yeah, they told me.
Hello?
Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois,   and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia.
I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?
What do you feel like singing, Bob?
Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and I'll meet you downstairs.
Hans was very attentive to you.
Really?
It's for my daughter.
Where's your husband?
Do you ever see him?
Do you know where we are?
Why can't it last?
Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it.
It's just carpet.
Do you want to- 
That's ok.
I gotta go meet Kelly for a drink downstairs. She wants to talk about some photo thing.
We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.
Bad?
Peter, where are you?
I'm gonna have to get a restraining order.  What a nightmare.
No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
Must be a spare set.
I can take care of myself.
You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.
There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.
Something he said, just before...
You're right, but it's funny.  All my life I thought I was simply a man who didn't believe in any of it.
You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.
You raised me, like a son.
Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
How many weeks are you honey/
I'll bet.
So...what did you think of the tape.
Hang on, get it up, go on, higher.
I know who he is.
I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.
We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
Well, long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject. After awhile, you begin to make friends with it, so to speak.
No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
You're referring to the defense's efforts to prove that George Viznick is tormented by "demonic voices?"
What do you mean by that?
What's this?
Mother killed the father, then killed herself.  Crime of passion.
I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
How is he?
Whatever.
You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
I don't remember that.
He's fine.
...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then...
You're a caterer?
I'm an English major.  You like English?
My mouth is kinda dry.
That was nice.
Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's college bound with or without basketball.
I don't wanna see that.
Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?
Always on my ass, anyway.
Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
I told him you looked like me.
Yeah, right.
Too many times.
Coach hates me, doesn't she?
What's that?
Well, what do you know.
I wouldn't know.
My Dad plays for the "Clippers."  He says I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma play for them, too.  Same number and everything.
I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
I don't like flowers.
Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.
Yeah.
Fine, Quincy.
I can't help girls coming up to me.
Then prove her wrong.
She understands.
Hey.
What's up?
Who's nobody?
Least you got your priorities straight.
Look, I'm entering the draft.
Alright.  I heard you were in Spain.
I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.
Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American.  And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again.
Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your knee, and everything.
Who's this guy I always see her around?
So you're gonna bitch up?
What will this prove?
So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.
We should head over.
Not great.
Still the man.
Guess he talked to you.
You know, people.
What?
So what are you gonna do?
We need to talk.
Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.
From your mouth.
And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  "I told you so?"
Nothing's wrong, I just got some guy on the phone on my other line, he's says he works for this guy, this guy who's Frank's father --
Hi, hello, great.  This is Seduce and Destroy?
Uh-huh.
Well I'm not sure why you're calling me.
There's no number for Frank in any of Earl's stuff and he's pretty out of it -- I mean, like I said, he's dying, y'know.  Dying of Cancer.
It was scary though.
Alright, so I'm gonna transfer you over to Frank's assitant, Janet she's gonna see what she can do --
...what the fuck is this...?
What do you want? Why are you here?
Why are you here, why are you doing this? Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?
I don't want you to think that I'm that way to you -- I'm not gonna call you a slut or something --
Now STOP IT and LISTEN to me right now. I AM DYING, I GOT SICK...now I fell down and I'm Not...DON'T --
Your mother wants to hear from you --
No.
Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --
I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.
yeah, good, ok.
Please, yes.
Do you wanna go tonight?  I mean, are you working?
Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?
Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something.  They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --
And I bet you say that to all the girls --
ok.
Wow....huh..."...piss and shit..."
What?
I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon.  That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --
I lost my gun after I left you today and I'm the laughing stock of a lot of people.  I wanted to tell you that. I wanted you to know...and it's on my mind and it makes me look like a fool and I feel like a fool and you asked that we should say things, that we should say what we're thinknig and not lie about things and I'll tell you that, this: that I lost my gun and I'm not a good cop...and I'm looked down at...and I know that....and I'm scared that once you find that out you might not like me.
....now that I've met you.... Would you object to never seeing me again?
Let me go, leave me, let me go, it's ok, please.
You live alone?
-- can I get you?
Diet Coke.
-- what kind?
Where's Richard and Julia?
Where's the news department at this studio?
I can check on that for you, maybe we can take a tour --
We gotta get his money so we can get outta here -- we gotta --
Why the hell aren't you in school?
Nope.  So what'd they find out in there?
Did you listen to me?
-- I told you who did it and you're not listening to me.
I'm walking towards the elevator's, Janet.
Do you have love in your heart?
Is it real love?
Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.
That's right.
Stay that way.
Brad, honey, you have a special secret crush over here I think, don't take him too lovely -- he might get hurt --
"It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
I paid you back.
You were gonna ask me weren't you?
-- he's fucking dying, he's dying as we're sitting here and there isn't a fucking thing -- jesus, how can you tell me to calm down?
Yeah.
-- how the fuck can I say anything to that -- I don't know what to say to that --
No.
There's no asshole like you.
I wanna see this...where is he, do you know?
-- let's talk more about your background --
I would just want to clear some things up:
She lived in Tarzana.
Yeah.
You're hurting a lot of people, Frank --
people die.
I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what <u>was</u> as opposed to I <u>wanted</u>.
Yeah let's...maybe just stand.
How long have you taken care of him?
For six months.  I'm the day nurse...
Uh. huh.
Quietly, slow down, whoa --
You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't --
You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
No you don't: But I'm gonna ask you one more time: Are you alone in here?
Maybe so, but I'm gonna ask you one more time: Is Anyone Else In This House Right Now?
And what about screaming?
No.
WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S THIS? GOD DAMN BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT. DON'T PUT THOSE --
...you know...
Come home soon after the show.
I'm a bad person.
No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now. You see?  You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up....
The question isn't wether or not you cheated on me, the question is how many times have you cheated on me?
Will that help?
No.
I don't know what I've done.
She's asleep.
Can I come in?
Want me to wake her up?
I'm sorry.
Was it a call back?
Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or something.
You don't want any water?
No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
This is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't -- I don't know. I don't know -- Can you give me nothing? You have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will -- I don't want any money, I couldn't live with myself, this thing I've done -- I've fucking done so many bad things -- I fucked around.  I fucked around on him, I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer, our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married. I broke the conract of marriage, I fucking cheated on him, many times over, I sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ....fuck.... Other Things I've Done..
The money would go to Frank.  The court would put the money in the hands of a relative --
You need to sober up.
listen...listen to me now, Phil: I'm sorry, sorry I slapped your face. ...because I don't know what I'm doing... ...I don't know how to do this, y'know? You understand?  y'know?  I...I'm...I do things and I fuck up and I fucked up....forgive me, ok? Can you just...
mmmhmm.
Ok. One of those.  And...um...Barely Legal?
Do you have that?
What are they gonna do -- beat us?
Stanley if you don't fuckin' stand up and go over there I'm gonna beat your ass --
Why the hell do you need all four bags of books to go to school each day?
You ready to keep winning?
Hi.
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
Oh God I -- Forgive me...
I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
What had you to do with this, Mother?
Your Majesty...
And some problems cannot be settled without one.
What do you propose to do?
You seek facts, when it would be better to seek truth.
He who is not with us is against us.
Those can be adopted --
Three days??!!
But --
Aramis, this will never --
Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
Then to the Bastille.
Everyone back.
Please revel with me, Aramis, I need my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm weak, my strength is gone --
Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple.
What use am I?
D'Artagnan, unready?
You are right.  But it is a trap.
That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful!
Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?
If the young woman truly loves Raoul --
I know.
It is honor you serve, and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor!
An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor, or anything else -- then stand now, and let it happen.
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone!
How did you know -- ?
But I deployed the Royal Guards according to your previous --
You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!
At least help Raoul.
Out directing the search for the traitors.
I would have said it was impossible, but I believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful.
This is more than you are used to. Your mother is a seamstress, your father is dead.  You have three younger sisters, two of whom suffer from consumption.  Don't look so surprised, Kings know such things.
You would do that, your Majesty?
Did you know... about Raoul?
It's Marvosa -
Did you start out area six?
Who am I?  I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me.  You understand? Where did you get the car!
Who is it?
Seattle.
I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.
Operator, I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972...
Holy shit -
You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.
Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.
Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?
Ditched you?
Did you have sex with her?
I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate?
In thirty-five minutes.
It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.
Book code?
'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book?
No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
Let's go to bed. I'll rub your back.
What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.'  Confessions?
Will... you saw this in the papers. The second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin' me a call?
If you can't look anymore, I understand...
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...
Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?
We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?
How'd you know 'broken mirrors?' Bribe a cop?  Tell it to the U.S. Attorney, Lounds!
Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?
Get me a plane...
Wait, Will...
I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes.
'Changes?'
He's a very shy boy...
Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh...
Will?
You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?
I'll cover the back.
What's being photographed?
I have work to do at the plant.
Francis? Where are you?
Are you okay...?
I'll see you later. All right?
It's Dragon. Dragon... Red Dragon.
THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?
What am I doing here?
Do you see?
'No' what?
God, no.
Now you will read this into the tape recorder.
Yes?
I want to see Lecktor now.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tenth and Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C.
He only bit women so far, right?
That's all we know about.  Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior.  You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin...  He bites a lot.
Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
Hello, hotshot!
At the store. You doin' some good?
I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there?
I remember.
Then why?
Hello.
I know... 'Out in the good air...'
My name's Will Graham. I...
Yeah...
Are you gonna kill him?
...after a while.
Stuart is fine.
Of course, you don't.  I'm glad you came. My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Second-raters, the lot.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
In the papers. I don't tear out the articles.  I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
Why should I tell you?
Then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me.
Pictures?
No.
I want your opinion.
When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
No.
Sitcom...?
Hi George!
Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
Oh dear!  George, this is gonna kill Tony. He's waited his whole life for this break.
You're so proud.  You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!"
Andy, do you realize you don't do comedy anymore?  Where's that sweet guy who used to do  "Here I come to save the day!"?  Please, enough with the wrestling! You've lost touch with reality!
That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
What was that all about?
I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!
Tony Clifton.
My hair is coming out.
I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
B-but I have them.
Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we knew, you were DYING!  Look at your mother -- she's still shaking!
What are you talking about?!  We just met an hour ago.
Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those goodies!
Andy, the theater's that way!
Ooo, the little lady's upset.  Well I say -- get back in the kitchen!
It's me.
Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
You're NOT DYING!
Andy, it'll be fine!  It's what we're known for!  "Maui?  "Wowie!"
Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
Then your father's a wimp.
"Philosophically"?
We had a deal!!
I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
I saw Michael!
Sure...
What's your name?
Then the informant is real.
He's gonna make it.
What?
That's the third white van I've seen.
Did you hear that?
There's something about him, isn't there?
He had an accident.
Whoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the Bejeezus out of me.
Dead.  All dead.
I need an exit!  Fast!
What is he doing?
You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.
Let me tell you why you are here. You have come because you know something.  What you know you can't explain but you feel it.  You've felt it your whole life, felt that something is wrong with the world. You don't know what, but it's there like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.  It is this feeling that brought you to me.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
This can't be...
Right now, we're inside a computer program?
This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.
So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?
Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.
She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.
Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!
We need an exit.
Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
Yeah.
That vase.
Okay, now I'm supposed to say, 'Hmmm, that's interesting but...' Then you say --
But what?
Hello, Neo.
I know a lot about you.  I've been wanting to meet you for some time.
Uh-oh...
Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.
How much like it?  Was it the same cat?
You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.
Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?  Besides a miracle...
Operator.
They've burned through the outer shields.
Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?
Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
We went down to Chinatown but they don't have any.
And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets?
Why?
So I'll send you a postcard from wherever.  If I get there.
And say what?
Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
Hey...you got nothing here.
I could have told you that.
Let's get out of here.
Your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you.  We've been in here calling...
Hello, Michael.  I've got something for you...not much...but...
What pipes?
I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
OK, ok...
No...I'll be ok for a week.
Hey, shut up.
Out!!!!
C'mon Johnny.
$3,000.  Shit!  Can we hold it at $3,000?
Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight.
...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...Our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do.  They know where to come when they need us.  I realize this during the war...World War II...Vito Genovese... during WWII he worked with the government, taking care of the docks...
No, she's got epilepsy.
No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
Yeah...but don't worry about that now.  The Hemmingway one is first.
I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
Well you can't blame them in a way.
The building on the corner.  That one!  He's been on the roof a half hour now!
Count it.
Sure.
Look who's talking.
Dinner?  Again?
I hate parties --
I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
Who?
I don't like cake.
Hi, Daddy, what do you think?
It's starting to grow on me.  But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?
I haven't been the father to you that --
I wasn't going to say --
Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
I'm sorry, I don't recall --
Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.
I would prefer some peanut butter.
How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
And what would that be?
Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
We're not getting anywhere here. Why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week --
Here...
Nice to see you.  I didn't expect you, but certainly you can't get enough of a good thing.
No.
In my sleep.
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
...Tomorrow we sign off -- photo opportunity, you and Big John, it'll lead network news.  Okay so far?
As close as a deal could be.
Sit down, Drew.
Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill?
Bontecou wants a quick response and --
The answer is no, quick enough for you?
And what do I get?
I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat guy.
I'd like to come, too.  See Susan strut her stuff.
I'm going to put a stop to this!
Yes.
Schoolboy tings is you head. Badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin' here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an' waiting.
Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.
Sure.
I didn't know that.
'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.
How did you meet?
Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.
Do you love Drew?
I've got plenty of friends.
I don't have any.
Why do you love peanut butter so much?
I'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today.
We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
Why?
To bed.
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
Did you like making love to me?
I loved it.
Yes.  Your father and I, our time together has come to an end.
We know so little about each other --
Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --
Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
Good morning.
Good morning, Bill.
Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?
Sounds fair enough.
That's what everybody says.
What's it like where I'm going?
Yes.
-- What's the deal here?  Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?
Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --
Why didn't you stop me?
I thought you'd heard a trillion times --
With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
Those were my words, Bill.
Joe, don't do this --
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
I am not a dream.
It just occurred to me --
When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.
'...I know, it's none of my business.'
What the hell is this?  Who are you?
'The one' to do what?
I'm sorry --
The 'question' --
I'm doing great.  You ready?
I am, this is it.  B Day.
Thank you, Quince.
But I've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, I've got some great prospects I've developed.  I want to talk to you about them next week.
This is great, honey.  The orange. Has it got a little vodka in it? Like that Finnish stuff, orange vodka --  Put your lips around this one, Bill. It's out of this world.
Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.
Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --
Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
Don't get dirty, Dad --
Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
Nothing.
Susan, I don't think Joe is going to be with us long.
I don't know, I can't say --
What was that?
So you're a one-girl guy?
Yes, I could.  I have an office in the hospital.
I've got to go --
38.
66.
Like waking. Like you always just woke up.							 *
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, But I've misplaced my key.
This was your room. You're up in 304 now.
Business is slow. I told my boss about You, about your condition. He told me to Try and rent you another room.
Why didn't you clean it out?					 *
Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
I don't want blood on them.
* So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * The world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? My actions			   * still have meaning, even if I can't			    * remember them. My wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether I know about it.			    *
They treating you alright?
Yes.
Such as?
What do the police think?
Who?
Me? Why would he be interested in me?
What's wrong?
Neither do I.
Help me.
Don't talk about my wife.
Calm down.
Yes.
Well, that's me.
This is your car.
You know it?
Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there, okay? I'm gonna be right over.
It's my condition. I never know if I've already eaten, so I always just eat small amounts.
Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.
We've got to get him out of here.
It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.
I won't be happy until you leave town.
My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance, we were well covered.
I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself.
How'd you know I was in here?
You're not coming?
No. Don't worry, I'm a cop. Everything'll be okay. Is he still breathing?
No, you won't.
I should kill you.							 *
Lemon doesn't go in Gin and Tonics, darlin'.  Where ya' from?
And...?
Sal Maguda.
What do you think?
We're not certain...
...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...
My end?
Okay.
There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product...
Were you born in Havana?
That's right.
What's the best fortune you ever got?
Do you have assets somewhere else? Bank accounts?
Sure.  As far away and as fast as you can.
When?
Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there...
"No, viejo.  That was José Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall."
The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people, not your people.  No tweakers, dopers, first- timers we don't know.  They didn't do time with us, they ain't doing crime with us.
And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
As in...?
Eleven to seven he blows it.
Guy's involved in a "meet"...
Who said, "go exploring"?  We want this staying on track.
You're so <u>not</u> the PD, if you got busted on a DUI, you're in serious trouble...you're bad men back to grammar school.  San Quentin.  Pelican Bay.  Marine Corps.  Statesville. Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked up.  Now you're too smart and too fast to get jacked again...
Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.
Oh, good...
C'mon, man!
Break your encryption?  Hack your e- mail?  Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?
...and thanks for the flowers.
What would you do...?
Meaning...?
What the hell did you do?
Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
Must be some mess back there.
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
You think I'm lying!
What for?
I want you to stay, okay? I goddam invited you, didn't I?
Shee-it. Cough yourself inside out, then light a fag, a goddam fag. You make me puke. Where'd you steal it? In the movies?
And what?
Okay. Here it is. You gonna go see the doctor. I got nine bucks and twenty more Thursday and I gonna be riding high before you know it. So you gonna get you the best goddam doctor in this town and get yourself straightened out, that's what.
I'm going to Florida, that's my only chance.
Hell, don't cry about it!
I simply don't have it, Joe.
You bet I do, sir.
You really want to do business?

Hey, you know what's gonna get us out of here?  It's not a map, Max. It's our balls. You know what I mean...  ...I gotta get laid man, I don't know 'bout you guys, but if I don't get it on soon, I'm... I'm not gonna make it.
Dad...  I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise.
For the money... )
You know where they are?
Sixty Lira?
Not far. Just a little way.
Stupid.
How much did you have?
There is no fair in Turkey, Billy. It's all "sula-bula" like this, like that. An Italian hippie had a car accident and a Turk was killed. SO, they threw him in here for six months...
Hello, Billy.
No... It looks like your going to have a new court.
What do you mean LIFE FOR FOR WHAT! FOR WHAT!
What do you mean?
Then we're outside the kogus. Then what?
Max - where?
Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
You know I have lectured at the University of Maryland in your country?  Also University Michigan Very nice country. We both go back. 
What's your name?
Jeremy...
Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
Look, I showed you my badge...
For Chrissakes.  You gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me?
Did you see the size of that thing?!
Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...
He didn't do it!
We're no leaving you!
Thought it was my week for that.
You give someone a fucking uniform and... Did you hear how he talked to us?
It didn't bite me.
Rub it on the windows!
I was just thinking how I could use a pair of pliers... and I remembered where they are...
Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here.
I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
Sure.
I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else.
Here.
Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--
What's your new book called?
No, what is it?
Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?
Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant.
I made you my speciality--scrambled eggs a la Wilkes. And I'm on page 75.
Show me the way?
You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.
I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.
Thank you for thinking of me.  Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?
No, just the paper will be fine.
Paul, you're dripping with perspiration, your color is very hectic--what have you been doing?
The what?
What about a bee...?
Have to wait.
Misery's alive! Misery's alive. Oh, it's so romantic--this whole house is going to be filled with romance. I'm going to put on my Liberace records--  --you do like Liberace, don't you?
I've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it?
Well, it certainly says you.
Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?
Oh, Paul. It's beautiful.
The stranger staying at the Inn, is he someone from Misery's past?
Paul, this will be our legacy.
Did I do good?
We actually got a phone call. Busy morning.
Stop--stop right here.
You don't think he's dead, do you?
People sure like those Misery books.
Yeah, I understand he's been up here the last six weeks.
No, no, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him...
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
Sorry I'm late. Jenny's basketball game went into overtime. If anybody ever told me I'd have a daughter who'd get a triple double, I'd...
Great.
One considers her timing, of course - getting nicked within a week of the plane going down.  Suggestive, even borderline suspicious, but hardly conclusive.
Well that depends.
Won't do, love.  It's not spring.  It's nearly autumn..You're in Oz.  everything's upside down and backwards here.
Sort it all out.
Good.  Biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof.
And you're happy about that?
Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really.
Well do you disagree with that?
Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.
Uh-huh.
Would you mind if I'm on top?
- right..where is it?
- torque wrench.
They've got a book for this?
Which is?
What's the population of Seville any idea?
Five, six-hundred thousand.
I don't.
This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much.
How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.
You don't trust me.
- Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to me.  Then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house.
Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.
Ethan, you know what frightens me most when I'm with him?..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here?
Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.
Not yet.  We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.
You mean that leaves Miss Hall.
- good.  Then if you manage to get hold of Ambrose, and obtain what he's got, you've got -  - 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of Chimera on earth.
Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.
Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
Well, yes.  I suppose I am a bit anxious.
It's the transponder.
That simple, huh?
Ambrose just pulled the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into an envelope, put it in his inner left jacket pocket...
Luther, say again.
Only four more cars.
Krieger.
I'm walking.
Did they send you...Did they send you?
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
It's cash. And a second passport. If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk away.
Kittridge...
Okay...
Two cars.  Where are you?
Ethanís right behind me.  Listen to me Jim.  Is it such a good idea to kill him? We take the money.  Ethan takes the blame.  No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him.
Of course - Iím sorry to hear you say that Claire.
No sir.
For a little over two years now we've been spotting serious blowback in IMF operations.  We have a penetration.  The other day we decoded a message on the Internet from a Czech we know as "Max."
The arms dealer.
What kind?
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
What sector's the air conditioning?
Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off.
That's not it.  That's not the list.
I'm willing to take the chance.
Oh?  What's the problem?
I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me.
When you started noticing your short term memory loss.  What <u>the problem was</u> you and Claire had in Kiev?
No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
Whatís going to make him do that?
Youíre probably right.
Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?
Very good, Mr. Johnny.
I forgot to bring the champagne, Mr. Johnny.
I don't like him.
Well, what do you wanna talk about!
Rita. Pass the wine.
A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day.
I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
Ti amo.
He got hit by a bus.
Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?
And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
It's wrong to just let them go.
Yes!
Yes.
Why?
That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
Why?
Why what?
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
She was right to leave me.
Where are you taking me?
All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.
I've got you.
What? What have we done?
Oh yes, oh yes you did! You've got those bad eyes like a gypsy! Why didn't I see it yesterday! Bad Luck! Is that all I'm ever gonna have? Why didn't I just pick up a stone and kill myself years and years ago? I'm gonna marry him!
Awful?
What do you want to do now?
Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta.
I know what I know.
I'm here!
I was.
Let me go home.
Maybe you're right.
A week. Two weeks. No more.
He's my younger brother.
In time, you will see that this is the best thing.
So we'll sell the house.
What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over.
What the hell happened to you?
What? He's in Sicily!
He's with his dying mother!
Hi, Loretta.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession.
My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay.
I came right from the airport.
It's late.
Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
What do you do?
Don't shit where you eat.
Why do men chase women?
I think it's because they fear death.
Temperature's dropping.
Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek, too?
You mean the whole house?
Rita. Rita.
Oh.
What are you talking about, you fool? Her fiancé's in Palermo.
Ah.  Yes, of course ... um ... err ...
Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
Halt!  Who goes there?
Dennis! There's some lovely filth down here ...  Oh! how d'you do?
You don't vote for kings.
The same!
We shall say Ni! again to you if you do not appease us.
I cannot tell you.  Suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!
You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
Had enough?
Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?
Well now, Launcelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the French by surprise, not only by surprise but totally unarmed!
Who are you? TALL KNIGHT We are the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
We shall attack at once.
There are some who call me Tim?
You know my name?
How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
What?
It is the rabbit.
Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.
I'm thirty-seven.
You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!
Well, don't. |      I really don't know where all this got started. It's like those miserable psalms.  they're so depressing. Now knock it of
You're not fooling anyone you know.  Isn't there anything you could do?
What is your favorite colour?
That's easy!
Who's that then?
Thank you, sir, most kind ...
What - the curtains?
But, Mother ...
Herbert ...  We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.
Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!
Right.
Make sure he doesn't leave.
Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!
Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
Sir Galahad!
Why?
We'll cover your escape!
We must examine you.
Bravely ran away, away.
How much?
How about yourself?
Come on, man.  There's love and there's ...
So?  Someone'll send it on ahead.
She's got an army of people to get her up and out.
You watch your tongue.
What's this?
Checked and locked, sir.
Yeah.
Mr Disraeli.  Ma'am.
Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
No doubt you've heard the rumors.
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs.  But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence.  The Tory Party has always been our party.
I tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself First President's Opposition.  Du Royaum Uni.
Convey her a message.
Mother....
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
Mama...
What happens to John Brown is his business, but the Queen's security will never be compromised!
Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House is not as you will remember it.  The Household remains in full mourning and no-one is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever.  As for the Queen's routine, she breakfasts at nine thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five.  No one is allowed to leave the building while the Queen is at home. On the rare occasions when she is out, you may ask permission to leave, but only with my consent. You're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock.  You'll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires.
She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
This is a slur on her good name.
In as much as the article is about yourself, I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you.
Nobody has any rights over me.
The Queen will be riding to St. George's on the fifth.
What brings you here?
Occasionally.
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
I do what I do.
Her mind is set.  She won't change now.
See what?
Too busy looking after themselves.
I am.
Yes, ma'am.
It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not?
Those, over there, there.
I am told so.
What does he know about the Highlands?
What is it, John?  John?
-- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me!
Is that not enough?
The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
The question is, do we need her?
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
So?
Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?
In the press, perhaps.  But she's sold more copies of her Highland Journal in three months than Punch will ever sell in a year.  Time to wheel her out.
The Princess Louisa is too ill to move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.  You're smiling.
Erysipelas.
Dear oh dear.
I did not consider it wise, in the circumstances, to tax your nerves.
Just them?
I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation, at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. Dispatches, as usual, at two.  The Chancellor writes to say that, by happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes for the weekend.  He asks if Your Majesty might grant him an audience.
Why?
We were expecting you to return by six.
Why not?
If I tell you, then it's no fun.
Thanks, Albert.  Think you could print up those schematics?
Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
Maybe he's not dead.
Now what seems to be the problem?
I came from the city on the left.
So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
Can you turn off the game?
Happy?
It's the middle of the night.  They're asleep.  Phone didn't wake them.
Go outside, get your car, and meet me out front with the engine running. And make it quick, okay?
You're not coming, Alex.
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
One.  In case...
And we've still got time left.  This was a piece of cake.
Hey, my strength's low.  Look out for Fireflies.
So that's what we almost died for?
Christ...no time...
I know.
So tell me you're okay, then.
Think!  I want to go to the City of Truth, and the Truth Teller is from there...but which one is which?  The liar...think!
You have no time.  What is your question?
I'm thinking!
Give her a chance, will you?
I'm going home Cynthia.
Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls.
Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.
There is no problem.
Whatever.
Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Will ya do that for me?
Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?
Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
You're an understandin' fella.
How...  how'd they know I was here?
You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
I guess I've come to quite a place.
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together.
That's okay.
She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that.  I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel.
No.
It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.
I don't know.
Don't stop!
Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.
You have 43 unpaid parking tickets, sir. You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can & will be held.....
So what do we do ?
Hey ! I'm still your best chance to get out of here alive.
Excuse me ?
Why did you build this whole place ?
Do you have something better to talk about ?
But how do you know if the people are guilty ?
You okay ?
I work here, remember ?
Well, surprise, surprise, I've been on the payroll for several years now. I still have an office and secretary. No one even batted an eyelash. Do you realize what the high turnover is in a multi corporation bank in New York ?
OUCH !!! GODDAMMIT that hurts !!!!
Wait for what ? i don't wanna alarm you but we'll be the special at the International House of Pancakes in about five minutes !
The room has sound sensors. If you wake it up, it breathes fire.
Issues ??? This guy has the damn subscription to every psychotic issue I've ever heard of.
Don't eat at the console.
RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
I made my bones on the street, you know. I did Riglioni in his own house. I was made in the Family, okay.
What's wrong ?
Fire the whole division.
Not that well sir. I believe we have a few too many soft hearts in the building. Did we aquire a bank from Chicago or a charity ?
That was rather.... disappointing.
Zachary.
I was.
Might I ask why you no longer work for the mob ?
What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
Look he figured it out !
That is repugnant. You have the habits of a goat.
So what's next ? No one's ever made it this far before.
Do you want to go out with me ?
It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?
Yes, Excuse me for a second.
Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?
Look, Miss. I know you're still upset about that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business. We don't have time to play nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and Harry.
UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.
Pommeroy.
Hi honey.
Yeah.
Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.
Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
I love you too sweetie, bye.
She is not a child Harry, she is a young woman, she's on the brink of...
Disaster, disaster lurks behind every  palm tree.
I'm glad you're here.
Oh she's great...she's a little crazy though. Anyway, Hillary said that you had a black Ford truck and this policeman I know got in touch with Motor Vehicles and...he gave me your address and here I am.
I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.
Do you have any pictures if her?
What are you staring at?
That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?
So she had you in jail, in Russia?
Your mother?
Hey Vada. How's your report coming?
But we made a business deal.
It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books.
Get married?
Come and get it.
It's dangerous!!
You mean,  this ring?
Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.
...umm...Listen, I'm sorry...you had to sacrifice your entire vacation.
Well Rose was being very thorough.
Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.
They're great.
A secret, I like that.
No, you're the best and I don't want you talking to anybody on the plane.
Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.
Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every night.
I think this place is just fine.
You know how I feel about you.
I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
Good morning.
Well maybe for you.
Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.
Is there milk in them already?
Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike.
I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
No. You know they say, that it never rains, that you can barbecue on Christmas day...instead of riding your bike, you just surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the place is just crawling with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his dry-cleaning.
Shelly?
Really?
He is?
Of what??
No.
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
They're dead?
I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.
After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though.
In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.
Do you want to?
Goodnight Shelly.
I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours.
Shelly?
Pointing upwards Look...
Watch you don't knock out a fish.
Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.
I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. And i've learned to live with this chicken Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction.  Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.
Vada, we're trying to work here.
Dad??
She likes to play bingo.
HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing.
Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL bad?
Feeding my fish.
I found this.
I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.
Oh come on.
Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.
No, no no....
How are you gonna get the money for this old house if you're not working?
How much does it cost?
What do you get for that?
For this class?
Do you think she is?
Why do you think she says that?
Cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared.
Does he love her?
After your mother died, he was sad all the time, but before that, he was pretty funny.
Really?
Maybe black means you're happy?
Can we look around in your camper?
They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.
Where's Daddy?
Well he just left, what's wrong?
I'm eleven and a half.
Uh huh.
Is that your Dad?
What do you think it's like?
Here.
I am not.
Can we go yet?
I am running faster!!
California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch.
I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.
It is not.
Umm, Ummmmm
Yeah, it's in the contract.
... trouser width, this is all classic.  Which means safe, something I'd wear.
I should look different.
What?
Is it ever embarrassing, having your bum kissed in public?
Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.
No, no, the opposite.  That's my best friend, Michael O'Neal. He sounds desperate to talk.
You have a real philosophy of life.
You've been working on this, huh?
Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
How do you know you can touch that plug? Are you a licensed contractor?
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
Digger and George are with family in the Hamptons until Monday morning.  Brevity is even more in order than usual.
Excuse me?
Can you watch the road?
That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit.  Right from the start.
A trademark move, don't touch it.
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
About Michael's job.
Gold dog collars? They don't have dogs.
I saw the show.
If he gives you grief, I'll have him skillfully beaten, where the wounds won't show.
I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
I thought Michael was picking me up.
I've been calling for days!
Please come, please.
W...
What's the sec...
I can hardly wait for your wedding.
Dance card filled?
We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou...
Michael? What ha...
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
She denied it.  Said I was crazy and paranoid.
I had the craziest dream last night?  Walter and Kimmy had asked your boss to...
I asked you...
... yeah, that.
Lower.
It's not just a gag, huh?
Fine.  I'm an insensitive, chauvinist asshole, and you're well rid of m...
Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.
Winifred.
Don't feel that way, honey.
Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
You bet.
Whose word?
I got trapped and you know it, so let's have some rules.
How is she?
Barbara Jean.
Yes. She's pretty rested up.
Okay.
You're kidding.
Oh... Well... Have you heard from Barnett?
Harvard?
Haven's not going to talk to me.
Can I help you?
Yes, sir. I need a room
When you run out or money, 'cause you will here, you can go sing at Bishop's Pub. They let you pass the hat. All these kids do that. Most every place doesn't want to bother with you.
Sure... you're a fine boy, Ken, you really are.
He is just wonderful.
She had on high heels?
What kind?
I want to get the dog off my bed.
Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir?
Well, can you tell me why?
How long have you been with them?
I'm not sure. Where?
Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
Who is this, right?  I called you last night.
When did you think it would happen?
How old are you?
What?
Sleeping.
I mean...
Probably a little too long.
Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?
What do you think of him?
No, we never did that
He ain't really new.
He is to a lot of people.
Southern California.
You always live there?
I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
You think it will?
More or less.
Naw, she don't mind.
You got something you want to do?
What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
Susanville, Soledade.
You've heard of it?
The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
Not good.
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
How 'bout Manson?
She won't even see me, Mickey. Now you're not supposed to know anything about what's going on with her, but I'm gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't spoken one word.
Okay now, before we get started here, there's a few things we have to get clear about.
All right, Mickey.
Was what worth it?
No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it?
Says the United States of America.
Mickey, can I talk to you alone?
Just wait one fucking minute.
---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had.
They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
Just for fun, I guess.
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.
You should see the other bitch. What time you got?
Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.
They done that too long in my family.
Where' you goin'?
Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
I'll smile when it's funny.
What d'you want?
James Lee, you come in here and meet your daddy.
Well, she never gave me none. Look, you better find him a place pretty quick.
Like where?
Where's he at?
Hey, boy - I'm talkin' to you.
Don't say much, do you?
Guess I don't.
Have anything in mind?
Hard to get up in the morning, huh?
Like hell. You know, if you fellows stuck together 'stead of letting them walk all over you, they might not try it.
Okay.
Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
You work around town?
Your folks live there?
My father's the preacher.
You don't think much of yourself, do you?
I like a place with lots of life.
Well, they seem just like everyone else.
Well, let's see now - not counting tonight ... must be about twenty-eight times.
Let's go, Duff.
No, on the porch.
Oh yeah, and then what?
Well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get married. Now you don't want to hit the hay, and I don' want to get married.
Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
Surprised?
How about it?
Well, what d'you think?
My kids want me to teach them.
I don't want to hurt you.
It sure scares you, a guy like that - settin' out on his porch, doin' nothin'. I seen hundreds of them - all my life.
Man, we sure hit the jackpot fast around here.
How come you keep askin'?
I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.
How come you don't hate their guts?
'See ya.
I'm Duff.
Wouldn't have known you.
That's the trouble with you boys! Don't listen when a man tells you something.
How often does he get like that?
Whenever he's got an edge on.
No, thanks. I'll take the bus.
I know he wasn't much of a father.
It's hard to know how to talk to the white folks these days.
I guess I ain't.
And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter.
Don't look like there's a right way.
Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
Oh yeah?
Well, if it ain't Duff!
Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
Come on, Will.
No. Why?
Let's stay here, Will.
Let's go.
I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...
What the hell is that?
Alright. Let's talk business.
First sign of free will, Sense/Net usually slags 'em.
I've arranged for him to work with us.
Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
You'll be linked during the entire operation.
Yeah, well it's working.
As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.
You find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes.
Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
The access code to your mainframe.
Yeah. That was me.
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
Do we have enough fuel to make it back to Earth?
Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it.
Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.
Want to fucking answer them?
I know who you are.
What about before that?
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.
What is it?
What the fuck kind of questions are those?
How long will they watch us for?
Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
: Because he's Guy Perkins.  Listen, you want to walk to Na- Na's and get something to eat?
What's that?
Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.
Leave.
Well excuse me.
I'm concentrating on my career right now.
The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.
George! What are you doing here?
We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
Oh-my-God. You totally ripped off my Malibu Barbie idea.
Josie, you have totally transitioned.
Transitioned?
Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.
Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.
But I don't want it straightened out.
No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.
Get to know them. Very well. Your job and my job depends on it.
No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.
Yes you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Look at that--I rhymed.  Yikes.  Bikes!
Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold".  What about you? What are you thinking about?
You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
Josie Grossie.
Jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore.
That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.
You have to say that. You're my teacher.
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
Wow. You believe in me that much--
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
Aloha! Welcome!
Good. Gibby gave me champagne.
<i>                      I've got something, listen now, This one is real good, you'll see. We'll send a present to his door Upon there'll be a note to read.</i>
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
He sure is big, Jack...
Yes.
If you went away, what would become of me?
I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
<i>                      I say that we take a cannon Aim it at his door and then Knock three times and when he answers Sandy Claws will be no more.</i>
Just out for a while.
It's not the gas, Dad!
Don't tell me it's not the gas!  Your mother thought she smelled gas.
I wasn't sure, Ken...
Where's Jesse?
How come?
"March 7th - Glen asked me to sleep with him again.  I can't yet - I like him, I want to make him happy but I'm not sure that I love him. I can't sleep with someone I don't love."
Like a haunted house, right?  I don't believe in ghosts.
Look, you got electricity in your body, right?
What do you mean?
Disappointed?
Just some answers.  There are other kids involved, its not just Kristen.  All good kids, smark kids.
Are you crazy?  You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star.
I'm glad things have worked out for you.
When I was still a kid.  My folks got divorced.  After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.
Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile?
Nancy!
Hi, sweet stuff.  Good news.
Those are ancient history.
A little basic, but nice.
Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
Fred Krueger's dead.  You always had a little trouble understanding that, Princess.
Anything?
So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
Must have opened while I was away at school.
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
Doesn't matter.
They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.
And what are they?
Science...I suppose.
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
Only one thing can save the children. The unquiet spirit must be laid to rest.  It is an abomination to God and Man.
You said something before...about laying him to rest...?
Mom and Dad?  That's...crazy.  They never said...
I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
Now you're lying.
Well, they can be.
No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.
Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do.
You'll have to prove it.  This is a great brownie and I'm going to fight for it.  State your claim.
Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
So who left who?
-- this is a fairly strange reality to be faced with.  To be honest, I don't realize...
This is the place.
I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'
You think I should do Henry James instead?
The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.
Undressed like this, yes.
This is such a mess.  I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again.  For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend.
As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.
Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
Hello.
I haven't decided.
Yup.
I just want to say to Tony -- don't take it personally.  The more I think about things, the more I see no rhyme or reason in life -- no one knows why some things work out, and some things don't -- why some of us get lucky -- and some of us...
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
Bernie -- this is Anna.
Working with Leonardo.
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
I agree.
Pleased to meet you.  Did you like the film?
Martin -- your customer.
But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
Do you ever masturbate?
So I get the brownie?
Bloody hell, I can't believe it -- my whole life ruined because I don't read 'Hello' magazine.
Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
Hello.
No, sir.
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
Does she know you're coming?
I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.
It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I?
Spike.
Yes.
No -- you're right.
What's going on?
But you have no proof.
Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
Would you like to start?
N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.
Will you come with me, please.
Now that you mention it, I sure would like to call my aunt up in Portland and tell 'er where I am so she can come visit me.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, Mister McMurphy?
Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast...  You too, Mister McMurphy.
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight.
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
Mister Washington, why don't we get a good head start on the day by shaving Mister Bromden and see if we can't avoid a disturbance.
Whatcha boys playin'?
What's your name, buddy?
So long suckers.
I-I-I'm w-w-wet...
What is it, kid?
M-M-M-Mack?
Pssst! Hey Rose! There they are!
Let's go, for Christsakes...
It's the questions she asks.
It's as simple as that. You've been on our ward six hours and have already simplified the work of Freud, Jung and Maxwell Jones in one grand analogy: it's a pecking party.
You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?
It doesn't help him.
I'm the coach!
No!
Gimme a cigarette!
When?
Who told you that?
Big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? Ya hit or sit, Martini?
I saw thum! I saw thum!
Good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward?
Stay back! Patients aren't allowed to enter the... Oh, stay back!
I'll bet a buck you don't do it!
Out. It's the way out. So just keep it in your minds if ya ever wanna make use of it.
What you boys doin' up at this ungodly time o' the night?
You know, I never got your name.
Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before.
Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'.
Evenin', ma'am.
Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.
What are these men doing up wandering around?
Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...
Whew! Hiya, boys!
That!
Your mother.
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
--separate, in the evening..."
Let's find a telephone.
Oh no.  Do you?
No...
Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?
What's mezzaluna?
Congratulations.
It's an amazing place, don't you think?
Who's this?
I'm at the airport.  Why?
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.
He's safe.
I went back to that restaurant and I spoke with his waiter, just on an off chance, you know, and, anyway-- he knew the name of the guy's hotel.  So, I called there, they said he left yesterday.  But, apparently he comes here every year, always follows the same route.  He always goes from here down the coast to the Le Sirenuse hotel in Positano.  I called.  And they told me he's checked in.
What?
You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
What?
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
A "little white lie"?  A "little white lie"?
Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
I was hoping for the real thing.
Beautiful place...
I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?
Scientologist.
Is everything okay?
Is he gay?
You don't have any idea?
Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?
Is that bad?...
Thank you so much.
How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
What?
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
Okay, here's what I think.  We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--
Packing.
...and a fortune teller.
What?
Yes.  He is.
So...
Kate is that you?
Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?
I'm fine.  Have you seen Peter?
Kate.
No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
And we didn't have to bring another present?
What?  You know him?
This girl and the Father got their hooks in him so deep he doesn't know which end is up anymore.
I wish I knew.
Gerry G!! You don't want to do that, Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a confused kid.
Maybe he gave them an argument.
Mm—hmmm.
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?
Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals— you know what they're worth to us?
I know. I know.
What do you weigh these days, slugger?
I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
It was you, Charley... .
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
What happened?  What happened?
Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
I'm with Terry.
Everybody loved Joey. From the little kids to the old rummies.  Did you know him very well?
In braids? That's right.
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
Pardon me while I reach for my beads.
What-what? Where you been the last four five years? Outer space?
Do you like pigeons?
I'm not lookin' to get crucified. I'm lookin' to stay in one piece.
You've been off in daisyland, honey. Everybody's got a racket.
You haven't finished your beer.
Edie, listen, stay out of this mess. Quit tryin' to ask things about Joey. It ain't safe for you.
Because... because...  Listen Edie, don't get sore now— but I think we're getting in love with each other.
I won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.
I— I brought this for you, Terry. It was Joey's.  Yours is coming out at the elbows.
Yeah, yeah, it's up to me, it's up to me— he says it's up to me.
Told him what?
My hand.
It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
I don't want to see you killed. I want to live with you. Live with you. Any place it's safe to walk the streets without... .
Terry, no, no... .
Terry, for God's sake.
Then go ahead— go ahead! Go down to the shape-up and get yourself killed, you stupid, pigheaded, son of a—  What are you trying to prove? With a decisive gesture Terry takes the hook and sticks it through his belt. Then he goes to the wall and lifts Joey's windbreaker from the nail on which it has been hanging. He puts the windbreaker on in a deliberate way, and grins at her as he does so; then he walks to the door with a sense of dignity he has never had before.
Who is he, Pop?
He wanted to see me again.
What's the matter? I've got something That's chokin' me. I've gotta get it out.
—It started as a favor— for my brother— you know they'd ask me things and it's hard to say no— a favor— Who am I kiddin'? They call it a favor but it's do it or else. And this time the favor turned out to be helping them knock off Joey. I just thought they'd lean on him a little but— Last night with Edie I wanted to tell her only it— stuck in my throat. I guess I was scared of drivin' her away— and I love her, Father. She's the first thing I ever loved.
What are you going to do?
What do you want from me, Father.
You can!
Baseball bats— that's just for openers. They'll put the muscle on you, turned-around collar or no turned-around collar.
You're being served with a subpoena, Mr. Malloy.
Listen, this ain't for publication.
I'm just resting my feet.
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and—
You'll work.
Raise a hand to me and... .
—I was gonna feed 'em, Terry.
He's got his nerve, gum-shoeing around here after what you told him.
Well I got to watch myself these days. Know what I mean?
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 
Shut up. I like the kid.  Remember the night he took Farella at St. Nick's, Charley. We won a bundle. Real tough. A big try.
Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with the Commission and he did all the talking.
You want to know the trouble with you? You think it makes you a big man if you can give the answers.
Go on— beat it. Don't push your luck.
You want to know somethin'—?
Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
Sure there are--and I've tried them all.  Plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories.  Huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about--
That's life.  My kisses are alive.
Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy.
I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.
There are others.
You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
Hahh, there is always time... All in good time...there is <b>always</b> time.  You shall have your pleasure.  <b>THAT</b>... I <i>decree</i>
You mean...!
Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?
Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn. AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
I want to speak with you, please.
Did you know that when you married him?
You're good.
Go away, or I'll call the police.
It's Richard Ripley.
We may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where?
I'm just saying she wasn't scared.
There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink.
Paper says there's ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu.
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
Let's go to Detroit.
They know where I live, I guess they know what I drive, so maybe we should pick up another car on the way.
Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
I mean, they don't know for sure he's dead.  Look, there's always a chance we'll walk out've there with nothing.  I say let fate decide.
Yes, she did.
Shit.
We made it, didn't we?
No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport. I'll take one of Ripley's cars.
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
You talked to him?
What'd you talk about?
And what happened to Carl?
You'll have to ask him.
Yeah, why?
What is it with crack and transsexuals?
Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.
You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
Christ, I know Snoopy Miller.  He's a fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard.  Hangs out with a couple other Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
Sign says "Shut the fuck up."  Or can't you guys read?
It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
Look, what you worried about Glenn for?  What's he know?
You comfy?
If I could have a little more room.
For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
It was just a year, give or take a few days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  That spark, you know what I mean?  You gotta have that.
How'd you get this number?
I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me.
I like your hair.  And that suit.
You did?
Oh, God...
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
I wasn't sure you caught that.
My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
How many?
Looks like tonight.
You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.
Of course not.
I still haven't made up my mind yet.
What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
You gonna write me a check?
Hejira.
She did, huh.
We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
I'm freezing my ass off.
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
It's a guy you know.
You there?
Yeah.  If you can step up and actually do it.  Understand?  'Stead of just talking the talk.
That was some shit, huh?
Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the Cubans.  Linares.
Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?
Got run over by a car.
Where do you think I might find Maurice?
Technically.  They're separated.
You were talking in your sleep.
No?
Hello?  Yeah, she is.  Just a minute.  For you.
He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.
You here all by yourself?
In case no one knows what he does. Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says, "Undercover"?
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
Nervous?
Sir, I --
What lizard?
Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.
Upset?  Why should I be upset?
You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
I was grieving too.
She said I was so much like you.  I said, No, I'm not.  I'm like I am because of you, but I'm not you, not as good as you. Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder.  But you saw the better part of me, the part of me that could be like you, and changed me. You made me who I am.
I got a half a tank.  You?
Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it.
They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help.
What about easier to hit in an air raid?
We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.
We can explain, Colonel.
Boxin'.
I'm going to the war.  The real war. Hitler's taken Europe.  The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine.  And not just there, but here.
It's been...so different, being so sure you were dead.
Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.
Do you believe in all of that?
That never changes.  You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.
Borrow?! This was my dress.  Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say...  Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?
Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
I hear she does more than talk with her mouth.
Peggy Sue!
Charlie...
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
Yeah. Like that.
Where did you get that sweater?
Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
I'm sorry Charlie.
Charlie. About last nights..
Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love —— Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
I will be happy if I have you. I love you.
But what has to be different?
Peggy! Where're you going? Come back!
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
Terry, slow down.
It was Beth's idea.
You don't?
This is great reefer.
That was quite an evening. Bourgeois, phony, decadent, stupid.
Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humor.
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
I closed my Christmas club.
It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen.  Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.
I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?
Yes.
Mom!
Why don't you go lie down for a while.
My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast.
Who was that man?
She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?
I'm just happy to see you.
And the butter.
I remember that dress.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
What a great kite.
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
Okay. I promise.
I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.
That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?
Like what?
What do you know about hypnosis?
Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
No! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad.  Oh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap you out of it.
Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.
Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me.
Did she always have reporters following her around like this?
I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now.
Hey! Where're you off to?
Damn dog stuck his nose in on my rabbits and they ganged up on him. I swear that dog's an idiot.
Zowie...
Is this a good spot?
What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works...  ...he'll come back alive.
It's weird...
How did it go with your father last night?
Yes!
I don't know what to do, Bob.
What's that on your forehead, pal?
Perhaps... you're right. I've certainly been busy. With the Kronos complaint, a preliminary injunction hearing and the Saunders trial all falling at the same time...
I almost didn't make it to the bathroom, Miguel. I almost lost control right in front of everybody.
Don't apologize for me.
It is, and it isn't, Charles. Macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program. If they're allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business. For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement.
I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.
You can save it for the jury, Charles. I want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, I'm a bad lawyer.  Gentlemen.  Counselor.
About my blood work?
This is my partner. We keep records of hospital visits. Nothing personal.
I'm trying to help your "partner." You're not a member of his immediate family, I could have you removed from the ER.
Client of yours?
Continue.
What's her name?
Rayisha.
So Kenton connected the... lesion, <u>and</u> whatever suspicions he had about your personal life... to this woman, Maria... and blew the whistle on you. Suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to let you go. But, up to this point, you've been their Golden Boy, their rising star... Their behavior is... inconsistent.
PARRTYY!
Not bad.
Beckett?
He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.
I better get home. Lisa and I are having some friends over.
Fucking Word Processing lost my Kronos complaint. Which must be filed by fucking five o'clock! If it's late, there's no case...  Every problem has a solution.
You said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had "an adventurous spirit." Is that correct?
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
No.
You could have infected him, isn't that right?
By the time I was fired, there were four lesions on my face, much bigger...
Where's Dad?
All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
Ms. Burton. You're black.
In what way?
Mr. Laird, when I approached you about being a witness at this trial, and you agreed, you gave sworn testimony in a deposition. Is that correct?
Okay, Mr. Laird. Explain this to me like I'm a four year old: Did Andrew Beckett win your lawsuit for you or not?
Let's put it this way, Andy: your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure.
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
Second.
Don't you know this is exactly the kind of bullshit that makes people hate you guys?
You have a problem with gays, Joe.
Now that you mention it...
It's good to be King, hey Charles?
You'll be sorry, Beckett.
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  Where you goin'?
Tell me that was you.
Oh, Lord....
You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there?
Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.
Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
Had it with deals.
I promised them we'd go back with more light. And that's exactly what we're gonna do..
What, you're afraid?
I can't....I can't....
Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.
Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.
You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
So why isn't it all bloody?
15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch.
Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your theories on --
Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.
Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns.
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
You have a little caffeine in the morning, I have a little morphine. So what?
<u>You</u> made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
My first run-in with Riddick. Went for the sweet-spot and missed. They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can feel it, sometimes, pressing against the cord.  So maybe the care and feeding of my nerve-endings is my business.
What the hell's it matter?
79 kilos.
Hey, <u>you're</u> the one who got me out here, turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An' now you 'spect me to go back like a <u>whipped</u> dog?
-- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.
So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
Why did I fall on you?
He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
Some prophet guy?
And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
What?
Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more space 'tween us and them.
Where's Mr. Johns?
Which half?
"God is Great," yes?
I had the impression...from the model... that the two planets were moving as one. That there would be...a lasting darkness.
...then we saw this.
What the hell are these?
I'd rather piss glass.
Well, you got the big gauge.
<u>Fuck me</u>. You said "clear."
About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
Dr. Zaius --
How did you know we'd come here?
I apologize.
Look -- she remembers.
Got your sensors?
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.
Good morning, Dr. Zira.
Did you see that? It's remarkable!
Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?
Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.
What signal?
Well? Where are we? Have any notion, skipper?
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
If only we could get a fix.
What is it?
Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.
Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?
What about it?
A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
What is your proposal?
Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
Elias is dead. Join up with the platoon. Move it.
We got boo-coo movement. 3rd Battalion just got hit 15 kliks north of here. 
I can't do that for you, Red... We need every swinging dick in the field. Sorry bout that... 
Hey Taylor, you don't know it but I saved your ass today. I killed a shit-eating dog. 
Don you worry Bunny, youse a killer anyway.
Yeah, you had a piece of pussy on a plate in front of you, you'd probably kill it.
Yeah?
Baaa, got no time to go to the movies. Love and Hate too busy fighting for possession of my soul.
Where's Lerner?
First time?
Yeah.
But what'd she actually do?
'People say I'm the life of the party cause I tell a joke or two although I may be laughing loud and hardy deep inside I'm blue...'
Why the fuck didn't you do something Lieutenant!
Sounds pretty far out to me 'Lias.
Then you jes gonna forget 'bout Elias and all the good times we done had? Right in here.
Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.
You could tell me your name. And where you're going.
I'll make one for you.  I live there.
I'm supposing.
Dine and dance tonight? I've got fifty bucks to throw away.
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
I'm sure you have.
Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock?  A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.
Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash.
Would you mind?
If you change your mind about the cocktail party, or anything else, give me a buzz.
I don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don't think I like you.
I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.
Bank?
What did you say his name was?
I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I'd like a dry Martini myself.
Whatever you say.
I don't.
Nice of him.
There's one thing I may as well tell you. You'll find it out anyhow. I tried to run away--when I found him out there on the balcony. There wasn't any plane.
So there is. You don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. Let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance.
Cold?
That's the second round I've lost tonight.  That fellow hurt me.
Cant be too close for me.  Right across the street from it suits me.  Anything else listed?
If you meant it, you wouldn't show it to me, Betty.  Or am I supposed to deliver it to dear Inspector Killaine?
That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?
This is the ace, Betty.  But not of spades.  They'll find out about the other.  They might know already. And when they get this--  What would they look for?  Where? Out there somewhere? 
Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
This must have cost a fortune.
Frozen.
I thought you had to be back to the hotel.  To leave my--my note.
Including Killaine...I still can't think of you that way.
I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune.  Most of it pretty dirty money.  I don't care to have that known.
So could you.  But our records were a little against us.
No.  I paid him off.
Mine?
You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?
This is it, Betty.  They'll find us again, fog or no fog.
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
Ale. I don't mind.
You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like Larry Mitchell.  Tell me about yourself, Miss Mayfield.
I'm sorry, that's all there is.
Please answer my question.
You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
Who told you I was married?
Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?
Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets.
Good morning, Mr. Killaine. I'm sorry I can't give you the name of my bank--because I have no bank at the moment.  That was a crude trick.
Care for a stroll outside? Beautiful morning. The air is like wine, the sky is a deep blue.
I'll find out, you know. Perhaps not today--perhaps not tomorrow. But in the end, I'll find out.
You understand perfectly.
I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.
I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears.
No, Jeff.  You don't.  He's not a murderer, I tell you.  He;s not a murderer.
Mr. Reed would like you to call him.
And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
I'm still asking. What do you want?
$40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer.
You hurt my feelings. I ought to raise the price to be a thousand.
There's two hundred. I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night
Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together?
I'm sorry. This thing has just knocked me silly.  How long do we have to wait for this police character?
Where?
On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.
Could be.
Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure.
In case you want to have us followed.
Could we discuss that some other time?
I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--
Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale, Killaine.
What do you want?
I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.
Floater?
I'd suggest a telegram.  Something like this: Chief of Police, San Francisco.  A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  His partner, name something-something Greer, refuses to give us any information. Correction.  Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist?  Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver, British Columbia, Police. 
The Super's just given me the sweetest dressing down I've ever had.  I'm still reeling from it. And believe me, I had it coming. I apologize.  What you think is important--I think is important.
What's the face for, Driscoll?
I'm looking for Mr. Brandon.
I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
Right. A clean deduction from observed facts. They've got to be simple once in a while, Inspector.
She didn't seem the type to lam out--even if she got the chance. That stuff was all gone through last night.  Anything special you're looking for, Inspector?
"G.G. Market one-eight-four-two."
If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.
Assume there is something to hid. I go to a lot of trouble.  What do I do?  What would you do?
This is the shell.  What about the gun?
Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
No doubt about that one.
That leaves two strangers.
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
I disagree, sir.  As Inspector in charge of the case I have the right to form that opinion, the right to act on it.
I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.
There are people in this world who don't think a police badge is a badge of honor.  I'm not one of them.
Not too far, I hope.
You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
I hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared. I wasn't lucky.
Right.
It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
What a shame.
It's fine, thank you.
You're kind to be so encouraging.
Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends.
Charles!  I didn't know you were back.  Have a good holiday?
Would you like a dessert...I'm having one.
I'll have some of that.
And some of that.  Sorry.
Are you going to have coffee?
Both dead.
I think we're ready now, thank you.  And how was Norfolk?  Did you get on with my mother?
C'mon.  I don't want any Jones about this.
It's obvious what you have to do. Your way into the daughter's pants is through the mother, up the Suez canal...
Fortunate that I was here to keep Susan entertained.
I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad.  It was just impossible to get away.
It was incredible.  He came back, made a pompous little bow and said, 'My dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish.' And he's promised not to talk to the Press.
Ah, Susy, it...
And that's why you never went pro?
Two years of surgery.  I missed my window.  Limped through law school instead.
You always talk like this?  You're not gonna start chanting or anything are you?
Ever done this before?
What's this?
Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
But you're not alone.
Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can I do for you?
Go on, Johnny.  Pull it.  But you gotta drop the gun, first!  Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with?
I'm not FBI anymore.
Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't.
Babes.
They found the drop car up on Mulholland.  I want you two to go work it.
What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
Smart.  You burn time in the vault.
Well, what're your ideas on these guys?
Yeah.  That was thirty years ago anyway.  L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.  So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents?  Be a big hero?
Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?
Look, if you're gonna go leavin' your piece and your shield in the car, you can damn well stay in sight.  Okay?
Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  Hey, where the hell were you all day?  You gotta at least call in or something.  You okay?
This gonna take long?
Stop here.  Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it?
Nice place.
Sure, he's "the Bodhisattva".
Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something?
What do you mean?
No way, old buddy.
Like the old days, Dillon.
You don't know how much I missed this, Dutch!!! Once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!!
Mean anything to you?
Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
I'll see you there.
Thanks.
Put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. We'll bury him in the morning.
You're looking well, Dutch.
Major, you'd better take a look at this.
I think it's Hawkins.
Georgia.
Your uncle will like this.
Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
I like your hat.
Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet?  I am.  This is Vivian.  You two been together long?  You and Edward?
What's that long building over there?
Storage, I think.
The real estate possibilities are endless.  Most of the yard we'll just level.  I talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said --
<u>Expected</u>... offer.
Of course, yes.  After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?
Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
Nice car.  Yours?
You're not from L.A., huh?
What do you want it to be?  Vivian, my name's Vivian.
It pays.
So do day jobs.
Ugly habit, biting your nails.
For the whole night?
For an hour.
You're joking.
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
Can I have some chips?
I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm.
Assets are anything of value a company owns.  Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole.  By selling them off, I make a profit.
Not... quite.
What?
Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500.
All right, two thousand.
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
I'm sorry.
And that's the way the game is played.
I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
You asshole!  I can't believe what a --!
I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.
But don't they have it in English?
One more night and you're finally rid of me.
It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
Vivian, life's not a fairy tale.
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
Right.
I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it.
Come on, you can tell me.  I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this.
Yes...
Why do you want to know?
So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient.
Give me twenty minutes.
All this because of that whore!
I just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster.  I wonder how much she made tonight?
Yeah.
Dummy.
School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.
Couple a hours.
Rent.  You're late.
You're a guest here?
That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely.
You're not accompanying him to New York?
Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.
Yes.  Something... conservative.
I don't think it would fit you.
Do you remember me?
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
He will come for me.
Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
Brides often are, I'm told.
If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you...
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting.
Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed.
I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
No more rhymes now, I mean it.
Give her to me.  Catch up with us quickly.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
Inigo -- there's more than thirty --
Don't pester him, he's had a hard day.
Inigo.
You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair.
Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
Yes.
See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
I tell you once again -- surrender!
Could this be a trap?
Your Princess is really a winning creature. A trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable.
-- offer me everything I ask for --
-- anything you want --
What? What?
Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?
This is noble, sir.  His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.
True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.
Slow going?
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
How old were you?
I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain --
And what is that?
Who are you?!
I must know.
Making sure nobody's following us.
Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-
Perhaps an arrangement can be reached.
You're that smart?
I smell nothing.
Yeah, an hour.
Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.
"Of the silvery mooooon,
Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.
Where?  What?
But that's cheating!
So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
What???
Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better?
Much, thank you.  But I am a little lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat something.  Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.
I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.
What are you doing?
What is she gonna do here?
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?
What???
I vas never a member of the Nazi party.  I am not responsible.  I only followed orders.  Who are you?
Mr. Liebkind, wait.  You don't understand.
Vit the Fuhrer, of course.  He liked me.  Out of all the household staff at Berchtesgarten, I vas his favorite.  I vas the only one allowed into his chambers at bedtime.
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
But he has long hair!
Do it!  Do it!
I can't take my eyes off you.  How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.
Hindenburg...
The Graf Spee...
The Blue Max...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
I always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy.  Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?
We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...  Did she stop here?
It was raining and her hair didn't look like that... damped out, I guess.
Tell me all about her.
How early?
Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
I guess I've got one of those faces you can't help believing.
I live there. Alone.
Someone is sitting in that window.
I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb...
No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...
Must've needed it.
Casharoonie!
That's the one I'd've picked for you myself!
It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...?
No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
What difference does that...
Did he say anything about my sister?
Here?
Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...
Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing.
What thing could we be in together?
Yes.
I just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'She stole the money.' 'We don't want to get her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the police in'...
I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
I feel better when you feel better.
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
He didn't come back here?
No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.
I didn't. I got a job, too.  I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me?  Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.
Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam.
Huh?
I know.  Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?
There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
Can you?
You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime.
Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?
Mary, whenever it's possible, tax- deductible or not, I want to see deductible you. And under any conditions.  Even respectability.
I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.
A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then...
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
You know what I'd like? A clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on.  And the wherewithal to buy what I'd like.  Mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available.
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
No.
You'd know, of course.
Where are you going? I don't mean to pry...
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
You should... mind it.
To a private island, like you?
An Institution? A madhouse?  People always call a madhouse "someplace."  Put her in Someplace!
You slept here all night?
Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
In the course of my duty, I never "take up" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! Believe that, M'am.  Now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that's one thing. But when you act as if I've just placed you under arrest...
We have a problem.
Mary is Lila's sister?
Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.
It isn't necessary.
I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening!  You are alone here, aren't you?  It would drive me crazy.
That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?
Did she talk?
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
You--a friend to me?
Thousands?
Dr. Meirschultz, please.
I'm losing my blood!
What were you dreaming about?
Did you? Where?
I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
Thank you.
Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?
But I think these things are beautiful.
I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.
You give me a pain!
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
Great! ... If he's worthless we'll give him away as a bridge prize. Come on -- beat it. It's five o'clock. You need some sleep.
Which one is me? The horse?
Come down to earth. Do you think they would dare do anything like that? Don't you think they'd know that figure would be recognized? Shake your head real hard -- you'll be all right.
What do you mean?
Almost certain.
Listen, stupid, could I do anything that would possibly meet with your approval?
Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was layin' there on the floor.
No foolin' -- any suspect?
Old Howard Winton's cub?
That's the one.
Where'd you get the stag hound?
What do you mean police dog?
Your dad has stood for plenty. Now let's get down to cases. When did you see the Dale girl last?
Then why are you telling me a crazy lie? ...
Who'd steal her body?
Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station.
How much money have you got?
Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
I'd be glad to, Mr. Igor.  I think I'll have somethin' to tell you soon.
Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
Two: what if I didn't miss?
A place you've never been.
Nothing is real until it's perceived.
What did it want?
No.  I didn't.   I'm listening.
I've been dreaming about this.
Why?
Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it.
What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost.  I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?
You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.
It was softer'n I thought, that was my main impression. You know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot.
There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.
I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
Rose, they could stick splinters under my fingernails, and I will never say a word! I will never tell them, because... I love you!
Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right.
Maybe it was eating all those rabbits that made you sexy, Rose.
Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.
I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose come in?
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.
Yeah.
This is my place and you can't have it.
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
Wonderful? He kissed her and played with her titty, and I don't see anything so great about that. He was probably afraid Mother would come back early and catch him.
They've been in there the longest kind of time. I can't stand it, I gotta find out what's going on.
Mother is struggling desperately. In fact she's fighting like a tiger. But I don't know, it's close, it's mighty close.
Rose says she's goin' to have a baby and she sure looks it, but I don't think so.
A baby... and she isn't even married.
That's the least of her troubles. Rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up, she told me all about it.
I can use a drink after the plane ride I had.
What's all this about Rose? What do you mean, you heard from her in a manner of speaking?
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
It's funny you would mention Rose, I was thinking about her all the way up in the car.  Or maybe it isn't so funny.
I am afraid so, son. About a week ago. Her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened.
Now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. Rose had a good life. She found her. Right, didn't she? She triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?
Well, let's hope for the best, darlin'.
They'll put her in jail. The damn little fool might as well be naked.
That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why.
He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.
What time is it?
Quarter of twelve.
Well, time will tell, won't it?
That sulky boy was here again this afternoon. I was almost scared, he wouldn't go away.
Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?
It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
I'm sorry, darlin', I hate it as much as you do.
It's because of the children she's got to go. I don't want to be holier-than-thou, but the girl doesn't have the same outlook we do. Morals don't mean a thing to her, not a thing, and we can't have a girl like that in this house.
I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him.
Honey, Rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life. Now I don't think --
Just a minute, Rose, you don't understand. This isn't a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it's nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it's not a farm, damn it, it's a beautiful dairy establishment! Stop crying, Rose! Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's ideal!
I'd say about three months. Are you satisfied?
Oh, anywhere downtown.
Yes, sir.
Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
Darlin', I'll take a taxi to the hotel. You and Brother can handle the girl's epizootics. I'll just say one more thing.  Rose, I told you you had a friend in Mrs. Hillyer, didn't I, that she would fight for you like a tiger?
He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman.
God forbid. You're not sick, Rose, forget it. Don't get any notions in your head, you're not sick.
Tennessee?
Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!
What baby? What baby? What baby are you speaking about?
I don't believe it.
Galley what?
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
Near Alexandria. It isn't in Alexandria, it is outside it.
Yes, dear, what is it?
It's simply that I find it incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from the girl's illness at the moment, she is very strong, a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one, too. She must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child, if only sporadically.
Yes, thank you, Doctor.
I'm not surprised you thought she was pregnant. An ovarian cyst can look very much like pregnancy. But it was pure wishful thinking on her part. The girl can never have children, she had gonorrhea at fifteen and it was untreated.
I'm sorry the truth nauseates you, Mrs. Hillyer, because before you leave there's a bit more of it I'd like to put to you. This operation provides a therapeutic opportunity that I feel is quite important in regard to this particular girl, who suffers not only from an ovarian cyst but from a certain psychoneurotic condition as well.
What are you talking about? I don't understand all this mumbo jumbo and the funny looks on your faces.
When he was baby we called him "Wa Wa," a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful.
Oh, no, ma'am.
What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer?
Well, you run on now.
No more dentists, no more dentists...
And... ?
This is private property.  This is breaking and entering!
It's bone dry out there.  Everybody's hurting.  The stuff floating around's been cut so many times it's like powdered sugar, but Zimnermann's gonna fix it.
Nothing, I guess.  Just an observation.  She's really something special.  You're a lucky fella.
She's right.  If you two are doing the horizontal polka, the last thing you want is a thirty-five pound bundle-of-joy stumbling around, knocking over furniture and calling you "daddy."
I'd rather you guys didn't do this again.
This is too fast.  This is <U>way</U> too fast!
We should slow down.
I say, fuck 'em.  Let's go.
Gimmie a butt.
You know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.
Where we going?
He tried to kill us.
You mean taking bribes, and skimming busts and letting hoods walk? You mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest Joe?
Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.
Couldn't have said it better myself.
It's our job.
Pardon me... my mistake.  Taking your thoughts in hand, huh... ?
Alright?
You think this is so easy?
Get closer!  Don't lose him!
You need a doctor.
No more counting the big money for someone else.
When you bunch it together, it's exponentially more powerful.  Two sticks have the power of four sticks. Four sticks have the power of sixteen, and so on.
This shit was Ming.
You cannot escape your destiny.
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
I can't see.
Your eyesight will return in time.
Yes, my Master.
Han!
Are you all right?
Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
I thought she was with you.
Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
I...
I'm sorry.
The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
Yes.
Well, look at you, a general, huh?
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
We're coming!
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
Come with me.
If that is your destiny.
I will not fight you.
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
You promise you won't tell?
He might be.  I don't know.
It's as if we were glued to the spot.
Janet.
Janet.
Yes.
Yes Brad.
I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.
Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of place is this?
Brad...
Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling - what if...
Good God.
You did right.
"Transylvania"
Was all I had to say
Who's Eddie?
What's funny?
Morning after?
D'you really wanna call?
I thought it might be cute.
...Are you going to say anything to him?
...I can't beat him.
Do me a favor -- His lungs, punch 'em out.
Don't do that again!
Get away from me -- I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself! So instead I put you two together -- Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me? -- You owe me!
I do -- Maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty.
Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.
I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
No doctor!
Yo' bleedin' inside, man -- Get that doctor.
Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best!
Did ya get the license number?
Don't like yours neither.
Nine minutes!
...How 'bout for the Cokes?
Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
You could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means Champion Apollo Creed is heading towards the ring --
The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for --
Without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl I have ever seen -- The ringside audience is spotted with blood. This fight should have been stopped rounds ago but Rocky Balboa refuses to fall --
A hundred an' thirty.
I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
Ya gettin 150 grand killer. Ya got any plans for it? Whatta ya think? Ya like to put it on the street, make it work for ya?
...Thanks.
What was I gonna say?
Yeah.
More like thirty.
Yeah --
A Rep from Miles Jergens' Promotions was lookin' for ya -- They need sparrin' partners for Creed.
Here's the card?
Respect, I always dished ya respect.
Wanna keep goin'?
Yeah -- See the fight last night? Apollo Creed beat that English guy bad.
Hey, Rock -- What happened?
Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
Ya caught me in a bad mood.
Ya always in a bad mood --
The girl's dryin' up! She's gotta live a little before her body dries up!! You're a pal, Rock -- How 'bout yo' talk to her? Y'know, it's Thanksgivin' tomorrow.
What kinda business?
Gazzo's gotta come to you.
How 'bout you talk to 'em about me?  Please do me that favor.
What can I do about it?
How will you fight Apollo Creed?
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
What's this, Roger?
You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.
He's a riot.
Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?
I'll bet.
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.
Not much.  It's hard to talk.
Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
So altruistic.
You shot Roger.
What the hell is that?
A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
I've already seen your photographs.
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
You tricked me, damn you!
So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
Just because you got 'em to laugh?
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
Me.
You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
I'll get it.
I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
If she is well then nothing can be ill. Her body rests in Capel's monument, and her immortal part with the angel's lives. I saw her laid low. Pardon me for bringing these ill news.
But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
Of love?
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
I'll not endure him.
Are you at leisure Holy Father, now? Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
Good marrow, father!
For doting; not for loving, pupil mine.
Hie you make haste! But look thou stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy, than thou wentst forth in lamentation. Quick hence! Be gone by break of day! Sojourn in Mantua.
Juliet!
Welcome.
Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: I pray thee, speak.
Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back.
Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?'
And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
Amen
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
Ay me!
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world- -why, he's a man of wax.
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
Signior Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
Meaning, to court'sy.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Ay, a scratch, a scratch. HA HA HA.
Always in a rush, you are.  All these years I've known you, you could never wait for anything.
Coordinate all you want, but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me.  Are we in sync on this, Vincent?
Who the fuck are you?
Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.
Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
Are you alright?
Alright, Gregor, I'm...
Yes, Gregor, they sent me.
Bad company...
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
American.
But first you have something to take care of?
Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself.  And I'm not any kind of Samurai.
Gets the job done.
Long enough to shoot back.
Who's they?
Is that right?
I don't particularly like killing, tubby, but I want you to know that this one I'm going to enjoy.
Something like that...
I didn't know that you spoke French.
Same thing, isn't it?
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
I've wondered that myself.  None of this answers my question, though...  Why bring me?
I wanted to see who you were.
What's going on?
What's going on?
I borrowed that, too...
I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth.  I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small time king of way.  To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun.
He's going back.
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
Alright, it's done.
You know him?
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.
I'm not here very much.
What the hell happened here?
Shut up!  Not another word out of you!  You're going down, the Feds know all about it!  You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest?
Well I hope so.  That pretty much cleaned me out.
He would have won more but he blew it at the end.  Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.
Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit I don't know how many were at large!  Don't you think there would be a bulletin?  This is a big ass drug deal!
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
What makes you so sure?
We'll torch the bases, how's that?
I...I can't do that.
Okay then.  I'll do it.
That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us.
I could kill that no good son of a bitch!
He's probably made copies.  He's not going to give them up to us.
He's going to be trouble.
How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?
Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!
You don't know if he was really gonna --
Dwayne's dead.
You're the one who's nuts! There's no one left to touch us, Booth.  We're home free!  We just plant a little of the money on Dwayne, and it's all ours.
Just one more.  This one knocks off all the rest.
Why don't you get to the point.
Listen Earl.  I covered for you. For both of you.  I put my ass on the line to save yours, so don't pull a hostile tone with me!
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
Come on, Booth.  Don't let him do this!!!
How are ya?
Yeah.
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
You got me something?  What's the occasion?
What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing...
Like hell it's over.  You told me he wasn't doing this anymore.
Let's not get into this again. I know him.  If you said something, he'd take it out on me.
I hate it when you talk like this.  Go on.
So do I.
I'm not sure why.  It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
What?
How about you give us what you have and leave.
What is this?  Don't be stupid man...
Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
Anything...specific?
Yeah, she is.  She comes up to about here on me.
Uh...C?
Sure.
Very clumsy, very clumsy.  I’d have found it in a minute.
No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and I’m a busy man.
It was going to be a surprise!
I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.
I didn't say that.  You did.
Dwayne put the gun down --
Well you're not getting, either.
What do you mean?  You gambled it?
I was in the neighborhood.
At least around here it does.
And not just any air conditioner. This baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail.
You want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?
What the hell is that?
You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about.
I don't think so.
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.
I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying your visit?
Would you like me to tell you how your father died?
Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that one.
Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? You're big time.  You own all them big hotels.  What are you doing in Hong Kong?
No.
No.
I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in.
Carter, get off that stage!
Hello.
How you doin'?
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case.
You thought the "Customs Agents get blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky Tan" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing...
You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane.
Follow the Rich White Man?
Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign.
He'll be back soon.
Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
You pull a muscle or something?
Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times.
No.  It's not right.
What?
It's your turn!
Get it out of here!
Let me see it again?
We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
Look, man I'm sorry.  I know you got a thing for her.
Shhh, my head hurts.
I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me.  We'll die in peace.
You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
Let's go.
Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
No you didn't!
This money is evidence.
New York City?
Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone.  You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation.
I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
Is this a payoff?
And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
Why don't you go get them?
Do you still have the bills?
Did you tell Sterling?
Lee, I've missed you, brother.  I heard about the two Americans, I'm so sorry, you must be under great pressure.
The police can protect you.
Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong.
Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --
You don't move, you understand?!  You don't move!
Lee!  It's him!
And that, of course, would be me.
Help me Rhonda.
I was being polite.
Witnesses.
You make the plate?
What plate?
No.
When a man steps in dung, it is obvious.  There is no need to rub it in his face.  The smell is the same.
You want more?
That's not how it goes.
Want some?
OK, when you go in, just act like you're from outa town.
No, wait.  I don't have it.  You have it.
I'm sorry, Lee.
Oh my god. Griffin.
You're killin' me here.
No...what?
I could get promoted right out of here.
Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.
How much they want?
... the director considers this top priority, considering he is a Chinese National and here under difficult circumstances.  His name is Lee.  And he is to be shown every courtesy. Within reason.
Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...
What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?!
Hmmmm?
Shut up!
You got a boy friend in here yet? ŒCause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye.
Hello.
Ambassador Han.
Yes.
I would like one of my people to help.
I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
I'm not running.
God... Of course.  I'm sorry -- I mean, I'm...  Brian -- I've got to go.  The man's a lunatic, but I know exactly where he's going next.
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
Tell me, why does Maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding?  She's already done this.
Don't be nervous, Maggie.  Let us visualize.  Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball."
"Sink the putt."
"Nothing but net."
See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
Or a vegetarian?
"Paid vindication"  That's what I call justice.
Same as you said.  What did you call her?  A "man-eater", "a devouring death goddess."
And you defending her?
Unbelievable, she got to you.
Like her mother.
You misinterpret everything.  We've all been friends our whole lives.  But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.
Ike... Hi, Grandma.
Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny?
I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you.
I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.
Lost!
I'm sorry, Bob.  She kissed me back.
About a minute...?
A little longer for me.
I'm okay with that.
I've been making friends with your cat.  Is it okay that I'm here?
Used?
They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
Reporter?
It's probably because you got him fired.
I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
How about ... you're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way.
Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home.
Am I what they had in mind?
We'll stay at the Plaza --
Who is it?
Couldn't you just do a phone interview?
And then I'll see you in New York --
Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.
Walter.
What was that about up there?
Oh? Oh, really? Now we're getting down to it.
You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" -- 
Turn on your radio!
That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  I am.
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
But he saw you, right?
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
Do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids--
The Historical Society wanted this and I never would give it to them --
Magic.
You touch her for the first time, and suddenly... you're home.  It's almost like...
Hi.
It's me?
Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  Does that sound great or what?  I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened.
I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
They met at the Empire State Building, only they didn't. Never mind.
How about rapacious and love- starved?
You'll see.
You think so?
It plays in 50 states.
Dad, I don't know about this one --
P.  Dad?
Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
Will she scratch up your back?
In the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff.  When they're having sex.
It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
It was sinking.
You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
Jonah, I'm leaving --
Jonah, this isn't fair.  You don't know Victoria.  I hardly know her myself.  She is, in fact, a mystery to me.  She tosses her hair a lot.  Why does she do this? I have no idea.  Is it a twitch? Does she need a haircut? Should she use barrette so it doesn't keep falling in her face? These are things that I'm willing to get to the bottom of, and that is why I am dating her.  That is all I am doing. I am not marrying her.  Can you appreciate the difference? That's what single people do, they try people on and they see if they fit.  But nobody fits perfectly, everyone is an adjustment.
I have to have a life.  I have to do things that I want with people my own age.  It's none of your business who I am going out with.  I don't give a good goddam if you're angry --
I can't believe you flew first class.
Hi.
You're kidding --
It takes time --
I told you it would happen. It's bound to happen when a man works alone!
Whose side are you on anyway?
You want 'em all arrested?
Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car?
Mama, can I put the candles ...
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
Now don't start talking against the union again.
I did not mean to weep again. Why should I weep for joy?
What makes you so sure?
Over my dead body.
No.
Can be what?
We've got to have a talk, you and me.
But you are needed. Especially now -- with most of the other men away. You're captain of the stand-by squad.
Sure, the standby squad. Stand-by for the funeral.
You mean you're ready to give up?
Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.
Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, "Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."
Go on. Spill it.
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
You mean Delaware?
What are you doing here?  Something wrong with Mama?
The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.
Did you see his hair color?
I guess I don't have a hell of a lot of choice.
I ain't a idiot, asshole.
Jesus, I look like a raccoon.
Don't worry. He's out of town.
Never heard of him.
Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.
And you admire that?
: What are you up to?
No, you're wrong, I tried to tell myself the same thing but I could have gotten up. I could have done something.
Is that what you want me to do?  Put it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out in the afterlife?
I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And you can't forgive for me.
Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
My features. They're Finnish.
That's a good one.
So, why'd you want to see me?
Yeah, Pooh-Bear.  Dude is a big-time cook. I'm talking dire.
You want a hit?
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
You don't trust me?
What does that mean?
Crank or glass?
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
I want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal.
Come on, guys ...
Pooh-Bear. come on, man.  What is this?  It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal.
Shoot him.
What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0?
Question is, what are you doing here?
I'm afraid so, Danny.
Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?
We know what's going on.
Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?
Don't worry about it.
Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team.
Resistance?
Casualties?
So, where are you from?
Yep.
Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him, just fuck the goddamned son-of-a- bitch.
What do you think?
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
A paratrooper named Ryan.  He's going home, if he's alive.
Glad of it.
Upham?
Would they notice and eighty-eight?
But, sir...
Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
Simpson.
He's right, Captain, it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys.
A couple of weeks.  It started in Portsmouth when they brought us down for loading.
HOLD YOUR FIRE!
Trust me, you're the best.
I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.
There's to be a bright side, look for it.
I'm listening, sir.
Sure, what do you want to know?
Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.
Up.  We're moving out.
Except for the last part, that one's not bad.
What if our guys open up, sir?
That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.
Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear.
Frogs?
On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off.
Don't let your father's business infect your life.
Just come down to my place of business, for god's sake.  I have people here.
What family?  We never heard from them.  I sold her house for them, made them money.
For going to school?
I hope you understand.
Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really.  If it's such a big deal, I'll go.  But remember this, it used to be fun.  It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you.  But I am not T-I-M.
Lloyd, give it up.
Wait for me for when I get round to the front. 
See you tomorrow.
Alright.
No, you're not a guy.
I wrote sixty-three songs this year.  They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight.
I can accept that.
Visit her at the home.
I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn't know me.  I mean, maybe I shouldn't have taken all those courses out of school, because everybody thinks I... forget it.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
Are you kidding?  You're not kidding?  You're not kidding!
Goodnight.
Dad.
And then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around.
I'm fine.
Dad, in a million years, I would never give him a pen.  What's wrong with having some fun?  I like him.
If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.
I swear to god.
No, you don't know what it is.  It's not for me.  This money's for you, for when you come back from England with honors to set you up, so you don't have to depend on anybody again.  Diane, I take better care of these people than their families do.  I care for them, I give them flowers, I feed them, I wipe their mouths...
Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.
I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
Thank-you.  The real world.
Yeah.  I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible.
Saturday, I have some things to do around the house.
No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
Alright.  This is really great.  Alright, we're going out. It's a date.  It's a scam.  Whatever, whatever, alright, I'll pick you up at what, eight O' clock?
Oh.  Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
Yeah.
You think so?
Are you comfortable?
I think that we should spend some time apart.
Yeah.
We decided...
No.
What?
Right, I'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon.
Okay.
No.  You just described every great success story.  Alright, it's alright.
Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.
PAIN!
No.
The truck?
How ya doing?  Is she around?
She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better.
It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'.  Read that.
Lloyd.  Lloyd Dobler, I've got you.
Lloyd.
I'm Lloyd Dobler.
It's gotta stay purple.  All night.  Hey Lloyd, how ya doin'?
Give me my firebird keys!
Things worked out.  I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.
I'm sorry to hear that.
It's true.  Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much.
You're not telling me something.
That's great.
That's great, thanks.
I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
What was that about the SS, the rate, the ... ?
Yes.
What other point is -
Have you checked the...
We don't know if it's random. We haven't been able to connect the victims.
Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action.
You're sure about this two person thing?
No, some creep asshole trying to scare me.
Stop it...
What if I said you?
Cotton.
Tons and tons.
And are the police sure about that?
My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.
I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?
You weren't supposed to leave her alone.
He sent me the cutest e-mail.
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
We had to have financing.
Hello, Dwight.
Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence." I think you've explained yourself.
Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.
You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.
Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.
Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
The young girl, clutching her bloody chest...drags herself, crawling across wet grass...the killer behind her...raising his knife again.
The young girl is slashed again.
Do you work for her now?
No, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Of course it's me, silly. And I feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. Where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes.
I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.
Jesus.  Hello?
Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out. Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.
Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.
Thanks.
You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.
That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
Yeah.
Where are you?
To see your reaction.
Can I help you?
Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?
What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?
I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.
I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
What do you know about trilogies?
Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.
Excuse me?
What do you mean?
What does this have to do with Sid?
Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
Do you really mean it this time Gale?
You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a month? L.A Forever?
It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!
Someone stole Sid's file?
Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
Possibly.
Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
Excuse me Detective, I think we have some business to attend to.
Roman Bridger, director. And brother.  She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like her was making a movie.
Who's this?
Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number.
Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with these re-writes. It's like every five minutes there's a new script. God, and you just know this all because of STAB 2's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting.
If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!
Yes.
Where?
No I need to call you. Just you.
It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
This is the best part, Sid. Billy's got it all figured out. Why do you think we kept your father alive so long? Why did we save you for last?
I thought she was dead.
Close call.
And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.
Oh it did?
No...
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
You heard me.
What?
Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
Fuck you.
You bitch -- where the fuck are you?
What number are you trying to reach?
I want to talk to you for a second.
Hello.
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
Really? What?
I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone.
I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you.
Please don't hurt him.
What kind of game?
Now for the real question.
I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.
You tricked me...
I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.
Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there.
He's not a suspect, is he?
I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.
You girls ready.
They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house.
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
Where is she?
When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
I want to talk to you.
Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
Have you talked to Cotton?
Has his story changed?
Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
He was drunk that night. He left his coat at your house, after your mother seduced him...
Where do you get this shit?
Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
Are you okay?
Can you knock?
...out at the airport...
And are the police aware you dated the victim?
I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
She's saving herself for you.
We could be like two grief stricken students and we'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly.
There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. For instance: 1. You can never have sex. The minute you get a little nookie -- you're as good as gone. Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an extension of number one. And 3. Never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say "I'll be right back."
His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho.
You're crazy -- both of you.
Do they know who did it?
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
It's past seven.
Do you really think Billy did it?
Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman.
For once, Stu, drop it.
Well, there he sits.  It's not supposed to make sense.
Put it down.  Put it on the ground.
What do you mean?
What's so exciting?
You can't see the whole... the whole complete act yet.  Not yet.  But, when this is done, it's going to be... so... so...
You're going to be remembered, and it's all because of me.  And, the only reason I'm here right now is because I wanted to be.
I wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into?
Who said this was murder?
You've seen my files, right?  Seen the things I've done?
You go to movies at least?
Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin.  And, these murders have been like forced attrition.
Nothing.
Never took a bullet.  I pulled my gun once. fired it once.
And?
I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
Victor's landlord says an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month.  He says, quote, "I never heard a single complaint from the tenant in apartment three-o-one, and nobody ever complained about him.  He's the best tenant I've ever had.
Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
It's probably nothing, but even if it is, it's no skin off our teeth.  The man at Hot Dog World is a friend, in the Bureau.
It's not what you think it is.
By the time we clear a warrant someone else is going to be dead.
Think it through.  If we leave a hole like this, we'll never prosecute.  He'll walk.  We have to come up with some excuse for knocking on this door.
Well, there are at least five thousand notebooks in this room, and near as I can tell, each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages.
The irony is, after a day of the type of work he did, he'd come home and read me these morbid crime stories.  Murders in the Rue Morgue.  Le Fanu's Green Tea.  My mother would give him hell because he was keeping me up till all hours.
Sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.
Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.
No I'm not!  I'm talking about common, everyday life here.  If you let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.
You know he's fucking us.
Well... what the fuck, man?
Well, I have to tell you...  I think I've fallen in love with you.
Wait!
I don't know why... why now?
You have a strange way about you... I mean interesting.  I'm sorry.  It's really none of my business.  It's just nice to meet a man who talks like that.  If David saw that paper, he'd say you're a fag.  That's how he is.
Perfect example.
I can't be a burden, especially now.  I know I'll get used to things.  I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks.  Upstate, it was a completely different environment.  I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.
Why always like this?  Only after the fact... this sudden realization, that if you shoot someone, or stick a knife in them, that person will cease to exist.
Lucy's going on seventeen now...
What you saw wasn't Lucy.
Dunno...Seems so.
He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.
You can forget that...  Wouldn't be legal anyway.
It's what we're here for, ain't it?
All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
Ay-eh...They was here...
Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...
Mose...try to remember!...You were in Scar's camp...
Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches.
Keep talking.
And maybe you lie...
<U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
Well, come on!
Easy on that!
What you goin' to do?
He's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while I'm gone...I'll be pushin' on tomorrow...
Because she's my...my...
Sorta like 'roundabout' -- like a man says he's goin' one place when he means to go just the reverse...
But I just bought a good blanket.
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
He's got to...All these years, run- nin', dodgin', knowin' we were after him...Now we caught up...It's him or us.
Why didn't he make his move back there?
How? She's even forgot her own language!
They'll be back...
You can keep your will!  I ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself...What kind o' man are you, anyway.
What's that got to do with us?
I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...
Why it's just a snip of calico...
From the beginning...
Who cares what he spells it? Read the letter.
One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
It still worked in town.
I mean the armchair!
Hey... the fuse.
Hey, flower child, the sixties are over.  And this stuff is hazardous to your health.
I have a funny feeling.  Do you think we'll get over all that's happened?
What?
Who was that?
It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it, too?
What?
Mrs. Straub!
Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I am unmanned, unmended, and unmade, like a puppet in a box.
What do you want, Kit?
Tomorrow.
Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket.
And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
Are you writing?
The title?
I have lost my gift.  It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.
Interesting.
Nothing comes.
I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary.
Cut his nose off.
by order of the Master of the Revels!
But nothing is happening.
I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. As I explained to you, the theatre business
Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!
Fifty pounds? What for?
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good!
Juliet? You mean Ethel.
No, it will turn out well.
Romeo is…Italian. Always in and out of love.
Verona again.
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
And--?
And I love poetry above all.
"…All my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay, And follow thee my lord throughout the world."
Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
"Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purg'd."
"Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
Who are you, master?
Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.
I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play.
There is.
Even your play.
Oh
There is time. It is still dark.
My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
You cannot marry Wessex!
An excellent beginning  Let him be…a duke. And your heroine?
You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die.
Nor you for me.
My lady Viola.
No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . .
Will you defy your father and your Queen?
Good morning, my lord!
I mean…Your Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can
It is not my riding day, my lord.
Do you understand me?
No, sir.
It is only ours you can know.
I … Her letter came to me by the nurse.
Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song.
Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.
You are on my ground.
Turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance -- no, this is important. Leveraged buy-outs -- a good thing or a bad thing?
You're a bad loser.
I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to know: I wasn't trying to win.
He made it clear.
So who's going to do it?
Then what? Who's going to do what?
Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
Is this necessary?
Not eating like you used to, that's what.
They know.
They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.
Take another look at these two.
Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
I thought you stopped going.
God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of thing.
For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
Who was it?
-- which is --
The man we know and love.
So what's wrong with that?
Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this, but can you open the door? It's us, Hugo, your flatmates and companions. Your new-found friends. He's not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again.
Open it.
Don't.
Don't look?
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
No, Alex. It's, it's --
Who's going to do it?
Be careful.
Sshh.
Cameron. You remember Cameron.
Who was it?
I don't see the point in that.
David?
What?
Of course, but I think you'll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed --
No, nothing, sorry.
Is this where no one stays?
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
Two hundred pounds.
No one.
Eh, I don't know.
In this firm.
Hello.
Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
No.
I write about it?
No. I haven't seen them.
Don't you think there's too much gold?
Then what's the problem?
Maybe he's just a kooky guy who likes doing something kooky like that.
You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
That's okay too.
Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him.
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
Yeah, I think so.
That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
Gee, that's very serious...
Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
I don't care about that girl, I don't care if she's dead.
What kind of treatment?
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
Sweetheart, it's a bore out there... let's lock the door.
Then it's not your problem.
No thanks.
C'mon, are you or aren't you?
You think that's funny, don't you?
I am not like my mother!
Right.
And you need money?
Right, that's right.
Jesus, look at this. Nine, nine and three quarters -- that's our prime rate. And I'll tell you something else: the big boys are going for it.
I guess not...
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.
I don't know. Probably not.
How long you had this?
No, thanks.
Probably the bathroom.
Well, what do you think?
Okay... but I want you to know one thing.  I've got to look great tonight, I mean I have to look great, okay?
Why not?
What?
Did I what?
Now, baby... if I told you about her... then you couldn't count on me not telling anymore... could you?
One of my few virtues is discretion.
No! Don't! Please!
-- look, you don't have to entertain me...
-- where'd you go?
Me?
-- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.
Why?
God, there's Lester...
I'm busy, man.
-- please, please forgive me...
-- took a bus.
Jackie Shawn.
Not yet.
That's too bad.
I don't have your number, stop by the shop.
Here in the canyon.
Keep moving --
I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together.
I am?
Of course I like children.
Honey, have they offered you the job?
When is that?
But I never know when you're working and when you're not working!
Baby, don't do this --
-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
-- no, it'll help me, really --
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
What're you here for?
I just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that's all.
Oh, well, I went to beauty school... you know you go to beauty school... and you get your operator's license... and you graduate... and you're a hairdresser.
It's an unusual trade.
In a way. But...
Well, George, I invest for a lot of people. I make a lot of money for them. More than they could do for themselves.
It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
Well, what?
I wanna hear about it.
I wanna hear about it.
What can I say!
Why, why do you think that is?
Want a drink?
Have a drink.
I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.
What?
Is that right?
I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.
George is going to open a shop.
Here.
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
-- No. No really.
He does?
-- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
-- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.
C'mon.
Well, there was this one time --
No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
Go ahead, Jill, you can say it.
All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.
What does he do? Is he an actor?
-- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
George? Was he alone?
I don't think so.
No.
Are you married?
How's it going, Doc?
I am, Dad.  Dad?
I guess so.
Yes, Dad.
You don't?  Well what's your favorite food then?
Chocolate.
Why don't you want to talk about it?
Yes.
No, I'm scared of nothing here. It's just that you know some places are like people, some shine and some don't.  I guess you could say the Overlook Hotel here has something about it that's like shining.
Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind... say like is someone burns toast.
What about Room 237?
No I ain't.
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
Yeah, I guess so.  Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.
The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?
Well all right.  But really don't make a sound.
Mommy... Mommy...!
Now Danny, when you were brushing your teeth, do you remember if you smelled anything funny, or saw any bright flashing lights, or anything at all strange?
Now Danny, can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth?
Tony.
How did he manage to do that?
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
He is, Mr. Torrance.
Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.
Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady.  That's all I ask.
I'm a Wendy.
Yeah.  We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.  But how did you know that?
Pleased to meet you.
Sure is.
Eleven thirty - Jesus!
I had... I had the most terrible nightmare I ever had.  It's the most horrible dream I ever had.
As soon as possible.
I just want to go back to my room.
Wendy!
Give me the bat.
Wendy...
JAck, just make yourself at home. Would you like some coffee?
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
even before anybody knew what a jet set was.  We've had four presidents who stayed here, lots of movie stars.
As a matter of fact we eh... brought a decorator in from Chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel.
Oh...well this is our gold ballroom.
Thanks.
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
Went shopping. Why?
There's something else scary.
Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know.
Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!
It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day.
You got a pilot's license, Marty?
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
I saw what I saw.
I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years.  What a marvelous program. Innovative.  Inspiring.  You are to be commended.
Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
LET THY SPIRIT
And you listen to that?
Hey, I know, it's hard.  But do what I do.
Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
I want us to be together.  Like people. Honest, decent people.  In the eyes of God.  Babe, today... I went to confession.
We can still see each other.  Just like always.  It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.
Babe, it's not me!  I love you!  It's God!
Oh my! 
Yes, Betty?
D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.
Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like yours.
Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.  You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear?
You see?  We've got the voices.  They're just allover the place. I've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent. Better than me.  We just need charts -- harmony -- chops.
Two days.  An hour or so.
What?
Shirelles.
Sure.  Kind of... free-lance.
Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.
Wet behind the ears.
Don't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting.  Make it look easy.  Again!
We could cut a demo.  Look for a label.
Three years.  Sister.
Goddamn it!
Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers free  We're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house.
It has come to pass.
I joined this convent some thirty years ago.  At that time, the world knew some measure of peace.  And hope.  Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise.  And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed.  Drugs.  Gangs.  Spandex.  And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.
Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?
As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola.  There are three vows that every nun must accept.  The vow of poverty...
Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.
As a new member of our order, I think you might also enjoy a ritual fast.
A what?
Right, sure thing.  But what about, like, appliances?  Like a little color portable?  Boom box?
Right.  So what do we do now?  Ping- Pong?  Row over to the monastery?
I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
A balloon and a banana!  Tell me, Mary Clarence, what were you thinking?
Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?
But...
A what? When are you qonna wake up?
You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?
Ten flights?
But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her!
I really can't talk about it now.  The place is packed.  SRO.  I've got a show to do.
Jesus, look at you   You're glowing.
You're not... seeing anybody?
Don't you have a concert to go to?
Then one day they find you.
Well?
Get her!
So that guy in the bar was right?  She's like... some kind of nun?
Sister Mary Patrick?
She told us about one.  The Little Sisters of the Moonlight.  In Las Vegas.
Is this like your old convent?
Mary Clarence, don't be silly.  You're an example to us all.  You've taught us so much.  We're singing for the Cardinals, and then -- who knows?  Maybe the choir can travel -- to schools, and nursing homes.
I don't understand.  Where is she?
It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side.
I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
An honor, gentlemen.  In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?
What is that?
I do not care.  You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place.
Bring him.
It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.
... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.
All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
Only if I repeat them outside this room.  And, I will if I must...  Out there, for all to hear.  Or... you may speak, as planned.  But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures.
I am the Lord's voice in this town.
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
Damn... damn... damn...
I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.
Have they nothing to fear presently?
Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.
It's spectacular.
What is it?
Lady Van Tassel.
Climb up!
Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
Small talk.
You made this, and the drawings?
I insist that you have it.
What are you on about?
Must I hear this?
Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance.
What?
A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
What was that?
Quickly, close it.
No.  She has gone out.
Where?
She has taken the last of our grain to be milled.  You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
Van Ripper.  Can you show where the body lay?
You are from the Hollow?
Can you help?
All right then.
Thank ye.
Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to see you. Been a long time.
He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.
Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it.
How 'bout you, Jerry.
Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?
Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.
These dang things are heavy. Hard to carry, too.
... on the third day I washed her. She wasn't very clean. I got all the right spots. She was the first one I ever kept for any length of time, you see I get bored easily, I have a short attention span. I can't say she enjoyed her stay, although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum. I don't really like people who talk a lot. I like to do the talking. I guess that's why I'm so fond of you. You're so easygoing, although I do sense a little tension in you sometimes. By the way, how was it out there? Did you have any fun? Make any new acquaintances? Tell me what it was like.
Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
Yeah, that's right, Frank, you better ask him. I mean, don't hurt his feelin's or anything, but it would be good to know. I'm sure it's nothin'. He seems real sweet.
You know what, by God?
What?
I thought I told everybody to get out of my house. That includes cocksuckers and retards. Get off your asses and go.
Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?
Now here's the deal. Now that I'm gonna throw my entire life away doin' what I want to come live here with y'all, we have to get a few things straight. See, Frank, me and you mama wouldn't have any problems if it wadn't for you. We'd never have a bad word between us. But since you do exist, if I'm gonna be here as the head of the household, we'll have to live by my rules. And my rules are you don't speak unless you're spoken to. Stay out of my way and do what a regular kid does. You're a weird little shit. I don't get you. So wake up. Face what they call reality. We're gonna be a family now. And it's my family. I'll be payin' the bills so you got me. But I ain't your daddy. You just treat me like I am. I'm the boss, okay. And the other thing is your friend Karl has to go. We can't have a normal family with him livin' in the garage and comin' in the bedroom at four in the mornin' with hammers and shit. See?
I'd better go on home now, it's late. I have to work tomorrow.
It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's.
What's in your bag?
I did live there in the state hospital.
Do you like to play football?
Hey there. I thought I heard somebody on the porch. Wasn't your name Karl?
He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.
Karl.  You know when I said daddy got hit by a train.
He ort not to talk that away to you neither. He ain't no count. He's mean to you and your mama.  Yore mama and that feller that's carryin' me to get somethin' d'eat's gonna be back here directly.
I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.
Yeah.
Naw. You can look at all my books you want to.
It's name's A Christmas Carol.
Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.
I didn't mean to say anything bad about you. I know you're good. You didn't mean no harm.  Did you ever think about killin' yourself on purpose like my daddy did?
Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.
Seems like Doyle's wormed his way back in. Mama said he's stayin' over tonight and he's talkin' about movin' in for good. We ain't ever gonna be happy. We'll always be nervous, won't we Karl?
Yeah.
We'll be on teams, me and you?
No sir.
I'm glad of it you was borned.  I reckon I ain't gonna be there in the garage no more.
Maybe you can make more sense out of them than I can. I made you a little old book marker and stuck it in that book on Christmas.
How come Karl won't eat here with us?
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
Well, at least he's tryin'. But who knows for how long.
Yes ma'am, I reckon.
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
I ain't got nothing but them books.
I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?
I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history.
Karl, you up?
Do you reckon you can make me some biscuits?
Right now?
Thank ye.
It's all right.  You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?
Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
You're a good mama to that boy. You care for him. You work hard fer him to take care of him. You light him up in his eyes, I've seen it. He wouldn't know what to do without ye.
You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.
Naw, I don't believe you have. I don't reckon I never been in here. This store didn't used to be here.
What brings you back?
I done et just a little bit ago.
I was thinkin' I could use me another helpin' of these potaters.
Oh. How about before that?
He just got out of the state hospital.
I think there must have been a little mix up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. It's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right?
Better make it charge. 
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales."
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
I've never seen anything like it.
Amazing.  I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project?
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
Don't be an ass, Auggie. He's trying to make it up to you, can't you see that?
Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
Good? Of course. Are you kidding?  I'll tell you what. Buy me lunch, my friend, and I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard. How's that? And I guarantee every word of it is true.
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?
Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you were dead.
Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter, but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did -- which I don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter.
Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?
Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.
You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
Get in, Auggie. I've got something to show you.
I told her she was going to meet her father.
That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.
Wait till you see her, Auggie.
Jesus Christ. This is all I need.
No you're not.
Why don't you open it and find out?
It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh.
I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.
They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
That's how it is with sidewalks. People come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. As soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty again.
And these?
And these?
Forty-four. They're on special this week from the Canary Islands. A real bargain.
I think I'll take them. 
A good choice. You wouldn't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers, would you? Remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out.
Is your name Paul Benjamin?
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!
I always knew that boy had an imagination, but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself.  Do you mind if I sit down?  He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects.
And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?
Just passing through.
I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.
It'll cost you five bucks.
Once you look at it, you're going to want to buy it from me. That's guaranteed. And that's the price: five bucks. So if you're not willing to spring for it, you might as well not bother to look. It'll just tear you up inside and make you miserable.
The name is Cyrus Cole.
I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.
Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
Of course. Where else?
I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?
And?
Let's not get too idealistic.
You work too hard, you know that?
Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
All right. Listen carefully.  About twenty-five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.
The end.
Yes, an invitation. I apologize for springing it on you at the last minute, but Mr. Benjamin and I are attending a celebration tonight, and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us.  Isn't that right, Mr. Benjamin?
What are you talking about?  You can't be serious.
Wow. They sure did a job on you.
We came here to deliver some clean laundry.
Lettuce and tomato?
Bits of blood and wood.  What else would there be?
Now defendant's father had also died by that point.  Where was the defendant?  When you sent his family their equity.
When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?
I said 'excited'.  Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed.
Yes, and then, what was there to call about?  Everything was up in the air.
It's just Pearl Harbor.  People are a little crazy, right n...
I felt Milholland's report in my pocket.  And wondered why I wasn't telling her.  Telling someone. What I'd found.
They only arrested that poor soul because he's Japanese.
Well, what then, sergeant?
You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
Well, the freighter.  The twine. The blood.  The knife.  The cup. The watch.  The second battery. The phantom lantern.  The fishing gaff.  The cracked gunnel.  The skull wound.  The blond hair.  That's <u>eleven</u> things...
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?
And I wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful.  At a tactic that insults their intelligence.
<u>Were</u> you, sir?  Can you <u>prove</u> one word of all your fancy story?
Never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place.
Still and all.  Carl was a strong swimmer, he m...
You wouldn't even see it move.
Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.
And yet you started the engine right up.  With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge.  Did that strike you odd?
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
Improved...how?
I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
You know, Bienstock, there's something funny about those two new girls.
A what?
Okay. 
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
Of course, the landlady is going to lock us out - Moe said no more knackwurst on credit - and we can't borrow any more from the girls, because they're on their way to jail -
Nellie told us about it.
All the way to Urbana - for a one night stand?
I think they got me.
You going to call the police?
We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.
We are going out of town.  But we're going to shave.
Not there - that's the emergency brake.
Bye, Sugar.  We been playing with the wrong bands.
Forget it.  One false move, and they'll toss us off the train - there'll be the police, and the papers, and the mob in Chicago...
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
Fight it.
Blow where?
What's the beef?  We're sitting pretty. We get room and board - we get paid every week - there's the palm trees and the flying fish -
Wise guy, huh?  Trying to louse me up -
Oh, he does!
Just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and Rudy Vallee.
You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
What are you doing with my flowers?
What happened?
You're out of your mind!  How can you get away with this?
I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy -  What am I going to do about my engagement present?
We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
Wait a minute - my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet?
Don't worry.  We did the right thing with it.
We'll walk.  And if we have to, we'll starve.
Oh - Sugar!
It must be freezing outside.  When I think of you - and your poor ukulele -
If there's anything I can do for you -
I'm not that sick.
How's the bottle?
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
Oh, I have some suntan lotion.
You know, Daphne - I had no idea you were such a big girl.
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
I recognized him too - his picture was in Vanity Fair.
Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.
I guess she's not in here.
That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
I thought I heard voices - and I just had to talk to somebody.  I don't feel like going to sleep.
Thirty-four.
How did those holes get there?
I was it.
It's about the Florida job.
If I promise not to be a naughty boy - how about dinner tonight?
Goodbye, Mr. Fielding.
It doesn't matter.
I don't like no witnesses.
Now look, Nellie - if it's about last Saturday night - I can explain everything.
The wrong shape?  You looking for hunchbacks or something?
No, we couldn't!
Where did he conduct?
Put it here.
I'm not very bright, I guess.
No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
Yeah.
You are?
Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose.  Wouldn't you know?
I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
I don't think so.
Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
How's the stock market?
Good school!  And your family doesn't object to your career?
You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.
What theory?
I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.
Oh?
Would you mind moving along, please?
It's been delightful meeting you both.
Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.
Well, he's young and handsome and a bachelor - and he's a real gentleman - not one of these grabbers.
Well, you know how those millionaires are.  These came for you.
My dad is more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio.  Which is the port and which is the starboard?
Well, that depends - on whether you're coming or going - I mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne?
A herring?  Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?
I'll say.  I had two ponies drowned under me.
Completely.
It's not the icebergs.  But there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this.
You're flattering me.
They just sort of leave me cold.
Is that anything?
Would you do me a favor?
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
I think you're on the right track.
Yes.  Now about our date for tonight...
Tomorrow night?
Well, anchors aweigh, you have a bon voyage.  And if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding, we'll be through here in a couple of weeks.
I know.  Every time!
Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.
Go where?
Mozarella?  Never heard of him.
We got different information.
From who?  Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
Me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over Chicago.
Spats Colombo.
I come to Grandma's funeral.  Here's your admission card.
Hi, Spats.  We was laying eight to one you wouldn't show.
So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste.
There’s finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
Did Kat tell you she dumped you because of your funky breath?
Wow. You look beautiful.
Mom’s refining her strategy for DDay.
I’m an American and in America, people sue. So to prevent a lawsuit, I baked a tart. And I don’t bake.
That’s when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
So, tell me, how’s unmarried life?
Kat, we must talk. This guy, there’s something not quite right.
Right. Seven.  Christ, that’s a long time, isn’t it?
Mmm.
The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot dog?
What?
Not you. You’re not disgusting. You’re lovely. Just the idea that they’d bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um, didn’t...who never.... I mean, someone’s dead.
And what if I didn’t want you to...to do that to me?
What would you do if you weren't an escort?
What would you do if you stopped worrying about what other people think?
Fourteen and he’s hoodwinked by a an erector set?
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
You let me make a fool of myself! You lied to me! I don’t know why that surprises me because lying is what you do. It’s your job. It’s who you are. How would you even know if something were real?
You knew?
“Not yet...”
Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?
Here it is, right here.
And the other people you told me 'bout, they is all colored folk?
You're a friendly lady, Miss Johnson.
What about Sounder?
Well, how did you like the class, David?
Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...
But where is my daddy!?
:--THE STRANGE ENDINGS OF NATURE THEY HAVE SEEN, MAY GIVE THE WORLD NEW POINTS OF VIEW AND MAKE THEIR LOVING, LIVING, AND DOING PRECIOUS TO ALL HUMAN...
:His visit with his father at the County Jail house --
:...FINER SPIRITS BOON AND GUERDON FOR WHAT THEY LOSE ON EARTH BY BEING BLACK.
Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him.
When the fall comes in these parts, the Night moon runs away like a rabbit -- you could stay out here lookin' all night, and not see a thing out yonder.
Mama is outside with Josie Mae and Earl.
It's a shame they won't let 'em come in here. If I had the strength I'd knock down these damn walls -- if I could just git my arms 'round your mama right now -- is they on this side of us, son?
Where was you, Daddy?
You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?
I won't go, Daddy! I won't go!
When's that?
Then why don't he holler like he usta?
That's right!
Can I go day after tomorrow?
I wish you wouldn't take the dog with you, David -- he's likely to be a burden to you.
She says I can come live with her while school goin' on, and come back home every time there ain't no school.
Would you like to have a cool drink, David?
Come, I'll take you home.
Night, son!
Mornin'...
Where you goin'!?
It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.
That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.
What...
Of COURSE!! Ice cream!!
How would you like to go to the principal's office?
Oh, son of a bitch!  AAGHGH!! I mean, son of a biscuit!
What?
Fuck that!  AGAGH!!
Aw, screw it. It probably isn't all that good anyway.
Man, that movie gets better every time I see it!
Hey Cartman.
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
Mom...
What?
Ha! Is the Pope Catholic?
What's going on, Chef?
Get out of here Ike, you're too young for this stuff!
Uhh... I don't know.
Guess.
It's so very cold...
That was sweet!
Nowhere.
Wow, dude. Wendy could really give a rats ass about you.
I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
It's only a matter of time before my mom has HIM burned too!
Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.
Well find out where that signal is coming from!  Then hunt them down like dogs! Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost!
I'm needing lunch.
Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt! Not again!
HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!
You're quite a purveyor of filth, little boy!
I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
You just get cranky when you're tired, that's all.  I told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself.
Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
Well I just want you to be impressed with what I <u>do</u>. I want you to respect my MIND.
Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?!  You're always making me feel like a piece of shit.
Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
NAZIS!!
Stan! Stan are you okay?!
My friend the clitoris told me.
Getting drunk is no solution.
I never though I'd be stuck in a wine closet with Warren Wayne.
Uh, yes I am.  And you are?
Oh, thank you.
So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?
Well a little business too.  In my upcoming project Star Trackers I play a ship's captain, and I really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience.  I feel it will add more credibility to my performance.
Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.
I was there.  Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors.  They are not functioning properly.
I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one.
All too well, captain.
Why, didn't they say?
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
Man, I'm hungry.  I'm going to call the steward, you want anything?.
If anyone can hear me please respond!
Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.
What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 -
This ship is going down in a blaze of glory!
Actually I've logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute, mostly related to starship construction.
We don't.
Seen one like it before?
Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.
A little dab'll do ya. Now you know how to get there, right?
I'm not going with you.
But how are you going to escape?
But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
We have room!  Let's go!
In that case, I accept.
Congratulations on your...recent award.
Carlo!
You're Delbert Miles!  You have more clout than some whacked out pilot!  Talk to him!
I tell you, something's not right here.  How do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves?
Certainly.  I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
Nope.
Hey, you still here?
Buzz Fazeli.
Theo.
Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress.  Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?
Orange whip, nectar of the bowling gods. Thanks sweetie. Millie turns the tray so that Buzz takes the untainted whip.  Theo takes the other glass.
Where'd you get this ball?
I do what I gotta do to survive.
I don't need the stinking pro-tour.
You got a better offer?
Listen, if straight doesn't work out, you come work for me.  Just make sure nobody's following you. Buzz's face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset, his halo bouncing in the breeze.
He's the guy Buzz.
Who's there!
Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.
So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner.
Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don't mind if I have a word with Theo, do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away.
Think of this business like a big aquarium. You gotta have some sharks to eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies can swim free at the top. 
There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.
That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
Fantastic! What talent.
Hello, Mr.Kastle.
Line up where you want it.
Like this?
Get that outta your mouth!
I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
Uh...over easy.
Do those two work for your dad or mine?
I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
So, what about you?
I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.
Sheila, please.
My mom told me not to stay in this town.
You told Junior that we did it.
It?
What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!
Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
Lips still for sale?
You faked my dad's murder. You used him! Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze around their car. He catches Sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand. Sid howls.
Open it, Captain!
Back away then.
Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before.
Yeah.  I heard you.
But she's --
Nice work, Captain sir.
Fifty yards and closing.
But you've tested it?
Maybe older --
Off the record, I don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me.
They pressurize us with helium.
How drastic?
He translated it wrong.  "My name is Jerry"?  It's like "See Spot run."
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
Yes, sir.  I'm here.
Subs are still at surface, sir.
Yes, Harry.
It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
Are you enjoying yourself, Harry, because I don't know what the hell you're doing.
Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.
We had considered it.
Resetting the sub.
It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.
Because when we get down there --
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
The library.
We have a library?
What do you mean -- not normal?
Wait a minute.
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
Beth.
Beth --
Don't do this.
Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
You, me and Harry?
In case you die, too?
The sub's a 100 feet in front of you.  You see it?
You fixed this suit?  Beth?
I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
How can the sphere do that?
But why is he doing it?
Parasolutrine?
What do you mean, different?
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.
You tell me.
You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  "Like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said.
Shut up, Beth --
Don't, Beth.
This is what I'm talking about, Norman.  Don't you see?  It's in you. This vindictiveness.  This rage.
Then where's it coming from?
I know.  You're too strong, Beth.
What is that?  What are you doing?
I never said that.
No.  I didn't say that.
Harry?
She's cracking, Norman.
I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there.  Take a look for yourself.
How do we decode it?
Push her, c'mon.
How's that working out, by the way?
You mean forget?
Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
Do you?
If it is an alien spacecraft --
We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch.
That whole time -- I couldn't stop thinking of what Harry was saying earlier...
No, they didn't say --
By the way sir, I've read your report.  I think it's brilliant.
What report?
Strange, isn't it?  You know -- how it would have a button.
Please, Ted.
You want to put him on your couch, Norman.  Grill him about his childhood?
No, not anymore.
You were right.  It is my responsibility.  The Force of Others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me.
You mean I generate an energy field?
What do you mean?
This is the last place.  Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?
At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.
You're Starkiller?
No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew.  It's not close enough to identify.
What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
You got yourself a ship.  We can leave as soon as you're ready.
You don't believe in the Force?
Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.
Watch it!  Move back.
No need, everything's under control.
I... I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.
You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...
But you promised!  I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!
That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
What happened?  I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...
I think we're going to need them. Blast it!
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
Mr. Barcalow, save power, don't waste it on workers... Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our way...
Did you read her mind ?
Your father will never let you.
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
Or...?
Well, whad'ya know...
What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager !
What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.
I'm gonna miss you.
Do you mean it ?
It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.
We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.
Take care, wilya Johnny ?
Steady as she goes, number one. Prepare for warp. Number two, design for Jupiter orbit.
What ?
You still gonna play for Brazil ?
Hey, Diz...
Good good, then it's all settled.
Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life.
Mr. Rasczak.
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer...
You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ?
The Marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. Rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ?
What's your problem now, Lieutenant ?
Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.
V'ger is that which programmed me.
Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?
The Creator is that which created V'ger.
The examination is a normal function.
The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.
The Creator has not answered.
A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By <U>whom</U>...?
Departure angle on viewer.
You'll stay aboard as Executive Officer... a temporary grade reduction to Commander.
My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...
... but I still recommend further simulation study.
You saved the ship.
Permission to speak freely, sir?
It's taken control of the computer...!
And in you, too, Lieutenant.
Twelve seconds...!
We're losing the pattern...!
You've reported that you felt strong thought emotions. A group of minds from a space vessel? Could you make out any plan, anything to do with Earth?
They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
Bridge, cancel rescue teams.  Spock, what in the hell are you doing out here!
What answers?
The point... 
You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
Annie...got an umbrella...?
You're doing a <u>Play</u>...
That's why they have state borders... whyn't you get a replacement?
You buy the typewriter, I'll get it all spruced up, good as new.  Better than new.  It has some history.
It's about life.
That's that's that's that's beautiful...
The, the, the, the <u>sanctity</u> of everyday things...
Everyday things...yes.
I...I decided to give it another chhh...
What I need to <u>say</u>...
The <u>Firehouse</u>...
What?
What are you doing down there?
Fix my glasses.
"Room Service!"
Why?
Time for a change.  Keep your margins straight.
Good morning to <u>you</u>...whatsa matter?
I can't get it to come out right.
Because it's about <u>purity</u>...
Would you like to <u>see</u> it?  I've got the key back at my store...
And come to the printshop.  You know <u>why</u>...?
What is it all about?
I'm glad you asked...I'll <u>tell</u> you what was wrong with it.  And what was wrong with it was it was behind the times. Now:  You want to bring <u>business</u> into this town?  You have to plan for a Waterford that Does Not Exist.  Not at the moment, <u>no</u>...
We on for tomorrow night?
What is it, a surprise?
It's all over between us.  I've found someone else.
Cluster of events.  Don't see something, ten years, allasudden.  Three times inna night.
Town ain't got no courthouse.
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
She wasn't in the...
How'd you like working with Richard Hill?
I don't eat vegetables.
Well, I can offer you something to drink?
I mean, okay, fine, but it's a motion <u>Picture</u>.
So you see what I'm <u>saying</u>...the movie is about <u>purity</u>...
How could she turn on me like that?  I thought she liked me.
Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?
Aren't you ever in school?
No.
He's on the Island, he'll be back on...
I want you to hear this.
Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...
She came in here, wait, she...I was giving her a massage...wait...Wait!  She came in here...she...  ...with respect...she took off her clothes, and she got in <u>bed</u>, I told her I could not--we don't know each other, you see...
Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
<u>Forget</u> the contract.  Claire.  What is it?
I...I...
Wally...
I know, it's the hardest thing in the world, and it seems everybody wants...
He treated me as if I were a child...
-- she's got 'religion.'
Where you off to?
Nope.  I'm just supposed to hold people's hands, while they die.  What'd you say your problem was...
Doug, the traffic light...
Arrest him.
What is the...?
I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
My wife's going to have a baby.
Could you tell me where a fellow goes to get a drink in this town?
We're very upset with her.  Get someone to <u>double for her</u>, her tits, the tits scene, call L.A.  I want to see some <u>pictures</u> of the women's <u>tits</u>.  Of their <u>tits</u>.
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
Hey, Joe...Good.  You know B...
I've got a date.
Let's speak English.  You've got to help the side.
I'm out.
The girl was in the car.
Then you're finished in show business.
So be it.
I don't know.
Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates...
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
We're flying over pigs, we're flying over <u>sheep</u>...
She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
That we could use you in and I think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.
The chairs go, the Lazyboy goes...
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...
<u>Whatever</u> you need.  The City Council, of course, has to pass on your...
"Assembly of Death" did 95 million dollars the first weekend.
Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
You see where Tom Miller's playin' the Old Farmer?
I read for that part.  Did pretty good too.
...we can't lose the wind...
&quot;Those who travel far and near this will make you DISAPPEAR!&quot;
Ben!  What's wrong?
I'm gonna call him.
She is only the <u>Princess</u> of Cool. <u>Mommy</u> is the Queen!
You lost Ben?!
I'm gonna beep daddy at work.
Annabelle pick up the phone.
In high school.
But Rache...
'In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you... held you so ti-ight'...take it, man...
Poof!  You're happy now.
Mommy?  It's not Rachel's fault I ran away.
Mommy?
I'm somewhere, thinking of you.  And meatballs.  And you know what?
That's Rache's song!
Before you.
But you can still see him.
Something's up wi...
They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father.
I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.
You know the kids aren't really in danger.  This is about Rachel, and you're right, I'm disappointed in her learning curve, and...
I didn't think a phone call was appropriate...
The great thing about life is that things keep changing.
You want us to take him tonight? Give you some private time with Annab....
What did you do?
She's been talking about this little editing machine, it's only...
Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.
I am not <u>here</u> to make it easier for you.  These are <u>my</u> children.  They don't want to <u>be</u> with you.
Anxiety.
She was angry at herself.
Jackie?
You WHAT?
And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...
You bet you are.
You're a cross-dresser.
The primo stuff is great for pain.
Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm sure as hell not gonna.  I just mean, I'm juggling a lot right n...
Is that what he told you?
Aw.
You taught my child that I am some limp dick <u>loser</u>.  Who didn't <u>care</u> about her pain.
You've turned her into you.  And I may not get another chance.  To turn her back.
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
You don't trust me to be alone with them.
Why are you taking this out on <u>him</u>?
It's forever you know.
They're my kids.
You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
She called it a fight.  <u>The</u> fight.
That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.
Well, technically your Zeda is a survivor.
Even though it was only his cousins that were killed?
Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?
Great to be here.
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
I did not go to high school.
You have a bay?
My grandchild-baby.
I am sure.
But really, you never know.
This is definitely better.
OK, you're right, you're right…  You know, we need to screen what we've got…invite some regular people, just some random off-the- street types…and see what real people think of this.
Look, we're not suckers. Everyone else is out there doing the same thing.
Was anyone in my room today?
Fine.
Oh. What happens now?
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
And you want Scooby to be the focus of all this?
Get the hell outta here!
Scooby?
Whaddya wanna talk about?
Thanks.
Uh huh.
Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
Say, Ni...
Again!!
But...you called.
Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
Prnceton.
Hey, um, Toby? I was wondering…Is the documentary almost finished?
Sure…um…yeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
What is most important to you?
Henry, what exactly are these crazed gunmen demanding?
What do you mean?
After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
It's nothing to worry about.
That's it!  Up ahead!
You're going to pay for this...
I insist...
She's still alive.
Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!
He wouldn't take it on the helicopters. He'd transport it through pipelines that connect Chemco to the waterfront...
What are you so worked up about jack? Fuck 'em--we don't need 'em.
Why should I worry?  Is there a problem?
Dissent?
Get your men to do it!
They must have got their hands on a test vial!
Well, it has been explained to me that, if you add a thick Cobalt-Thorium-G jacket to a nuclear device, the radio- activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years.
Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.
That's right, fella.
Major?...Major?  I'm Colonel "Bat" Guano, 701 Battalion.
Okay, Colonel.  But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works, huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?
So what?
What is your name, young lady?
Does the threat board show anything?
What kind of trouble?
I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.
But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
Why do you think I ask?
Yes, sir.
All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red.
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
No, sir.
No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
What's the gun for, General Ripper?
I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
Suppose that were the case?
Ask away, Major.
I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.
He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
I guess so.
And I guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.
But we mean it because we are a peace- loving country.  Are they a peace-loving country, Major.
Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.
General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.
Do you think they would cheat?
Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.
Once the orders have been given, Plan-R requires any new orders to be received on the CRM-114 in the aircraft.  But the CRM-114 will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper three-letter code group.
How could you let this happen, General Schmuck?
I want to talk to General Ripper.
He says they've only shot down three planes.
Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved.  Thirty acknowledged the recall.  That makes four shot down.
You've lied to me twice - I'm sorry, but it will be strictly routine.  These men are experts.
All right...we're still flying.  I'm taking her down to the deck.
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
Sure, I'll take her up to eight hundred.
Wing attack, Plan-R.  That's exactly what it says.
Bomb doors circuit is green, bomb release circuit is green, bomb fusing circuit is green.
Fusing for ten thousand air burst.
Everything still checks out okay.
What do you mean?
Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.
Lieutentant Zogg, how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back???
First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.
I'm okay.  What's up?
Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.
Lothar, can you arm the bombs for impact?
But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I haven't walked that far since junior high. I thought you didn't drink.
Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated.
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
It was pretty bad, huh?
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
Mm-hm.
It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One The Dialectical Expression of Testosterone." Isn't that a great title?
Uh-huh.
You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?
Your a nurse?
Oh yeah? Oh, how'd you ship it over there, man? Federal Express? Hm? By the time it got there it'd be way cold and coagulated. Total waste. Cheese be stuck to the cardboard.
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
No, I seriously doubt that Pony's gonna be in a limo.
No, he's not with a girl.
Yeah, a long while. A long, long while.
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
Yeah, we all stayed at the Four Seasons, man. It was party time. Hey, I hung out with Danny, Pony's manager. Really nice guy. We talked about the video. They want a raw look. Something fresh. Danny said if I can capture the reality of Burnfield, it'd make a great tape.
No. It didn't, Buff.
Look.
What she doin' in the van, man?
Tim...
Fuck her! Come on, let's go.
Yeah.
Come on.
I don't think I like that guy's attitude at all. Hey, you know what? Take off the blades. I mean it. I'm gonna break your fucking legs. Take 'em off.
Shit.
Buff.
Hey! Hey.
You better! Yes!
So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock?
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about...
Whoa!
Yeah.
You okay, man? You okay?
Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
Come on. Inside.
Oh, me too. Middle-class.
Mm.
Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.
That's what I mean.
No, no, see, you, you don't understand.
He says we got to be at the radio station at seven a.m. Can you handle that?
It's coming along.
Two-fifty? They go up?
He's drunk.
Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it easy.
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
Wow, you're cute when you're angry.
See ya later.
Oh, no, no, no. This is no big deal, you know? I can come down and, and get you out.
That chick, Erica?
Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool.
Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
I'm a loser. And I'm drunk. But I'm not gutless.
The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.
You don't know?
Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?
Oh, it's very complicated, huh?
Okay. Nazeer, okay?
Nazeer what?
Man?
Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.
"The worst I can do is starve to death." Listen to you.
I don't want to hear it anymore.
Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He's been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows.
No, no. It's an honest question. What are you trying to communicate?
God, KAREN JOHNSON.
Your completely missing the point.
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
It was a racial incident.
... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
New ground?
So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that your tree is not artistic if no one cuts it down.
No, no, I have to talk to you.
I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
Go.
What?
Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
So who are you?
I gotta take a piss. Do you mind if we pull over really quickly?
Ready?
No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
Wow. Hey, you look good. Like you, you know, head's in a good place, you know? You, are still doing your painting?
Like?
You do not!
Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good 'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man. You know? I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out.
If...
Soon.
I hate it here. It's so ugly, it's like being dead. You got out of here, you know? I'm ready to go.
Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first place, you know? I think about people and I wonder what they're doing.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
Well, uh, there's this benefit for Rwanda we're gonna do. And, uh, you know, my songs, uh, where I get the ideas for them, uh, you know, stuff like that.
Oh, How'd she get back?
Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer.
You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay?
Yeah.
Yeah?
So where are you?
Leave him alone, Tim.
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
Wait!  Did you say you are pregnant or you were pregnant... You had it, threw it out and you're gonna go back and dance all night!
Oh my G-d, you've been robbed!
You sure?
Oh my G-d, I read about this!  It's called a "pregnancy insanity."  Quick, she needs a sitz bath --
Like Cocoa Puffs.  Good.  Captain Crunch.  Bad.  Shreds the roof of your mouth.  I mean you hear, "Tricks are for kids!"  And you think, "I'm a kid, I guess they're for me."  But your baby brain's got no idea that Fruit Loops are, like, a million times better.  I'm going to save our kid all that pain.
...so although their dad said, "Don't get out of the car until I get back with help," they knew the sheriff's voice as he yelled.  "Run to my voice - and don't look back."  The twins did as he said, but at the last second they turned around and saw the escaped mental patient, bouncing their father's head on the top of the car!  Ah!  They jumped, Diane!  They jumped!
Oh... What are you working on?
That you?
Just call me later.  I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.
Oh thank Buddha it's you, Kim-Lo, I'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...
Hello?
No.  This is Diane.  I think you have the wrong number.
Ammo?
You want us to help you pick up?
And Hannah, you could give your share to your church - or maybe buy one of those hungry little kids Sally Struthers advertises.
We're dead!  They showed this prison movie to my youth group on Sunday.
Really...
Definitely old.
Oh please, we've all got bright futures ahead of us - we're not going to tell anyone.  Promise!
Wait a minute.  You watched the Apple fucking-Dumpling Gang?!
Now how the hell can I help you?
Okay, you can't tell anybody.
I mean it.  I'm in.  This is the closest thing to a goddamn family that I've ever had.  If one of us needs something, we all do.
Judas E. Priest, who did you borrow that from? Adolphe Menjou?
Carefull Those are dirty words! You sound like a bunch of New York critics.  Thank you, Miss Schaefer.
There's one called....Window... something with a window.
The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
Well....
I haven't been keeping myself at all.  Not lately.
What teacher?
You did?
Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.
We're engaged.
It's just impossible.
So do I.
Oh, you --
What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
Who's who?
That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
All right.  I'll give you a few more clues.
Hello, young fellow.
Last time I saw you was someplace very gay.  I remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table.
Then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.
Nothing.  I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio.  I had no idea how I'd missed it.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
I knew there was something wrong with them.
It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
We've made a lot of pictures together.
Thank you.
Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.  There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.
I'm used to paying my own bills.
Unpack nothing.  I didn't say I was staying.
Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
It is to me.  That's why I came to this house.  That's why I took this job -- ghost writing!
To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.
How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.
Why do you say that?
No you didn't.  You took the car.
Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.
Goodbye.  Norma.
Madame is waiting.
Naturally.  I brought them myself.
Uh-huh?
She never will.  That is my job. It has been for a long time.  You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.  I made her a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed.
Now wait a minute.  If we made it a girls' softball team, put in a few numbers.  Might make a cute musical: It Happened in the Bull Pen -- the story of a Woman.
Haven't got a thing.
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
How's that about your being my friend?
Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach?  Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you're through.
Greatest thing that could happen to you.  Now you'll have to sit behind that typewriter.  Now you'll have to write.
You do not deny having killed this man, Miss Desmond?
Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.
Madame is wanted on the telephone.
What does it mean?
But which one?
A Storm Dragon?
Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.
That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.
Don't leave me.
Like it?
Let me kiss you.
She said it wouldn't last.
And now?
Are you asking me for a "date"?
What?
Hey! Ethan!
Finished your estimate?
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.
Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?
They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?
Why George, are you proposing?
Theories?
Gosh, what do you suppose .that is?
Oh, no thanks.
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
Superman will return it.
How'd you do that?
Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.
It doesn't seem right.
No plans for the weekend, Linda?
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
The Danvers. And two of your little friends.
What is this place?
It's lovely. . .
Then come with me.
Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
You can use the wand.
There's no vodka in it.
The kid needs a man to show him --
That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
Peanut butter and jelly.
Call me.
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
So, Mr. White? Can I go ahead and make my travel arrangements?
The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is --
What are you doing?
Name?
What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  Everybody loses them fractions?
They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
Say what?
Wipe 'em out?
Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.
Yeah? How's it look?
Stone mutha.
All right, Kent. I just hope you know what you're doing. If you really think Smallville is your big chance, go for it.
Gus?
Mr. White, please, it's time for you to draw this month's winning JINGO number.  The prize is an all-expenses trip to South America.
Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---
Computers talk to other computers, right?
He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined it.
Nice try, Butch,  but it wouldn't be effective against Superman.  You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!
Where did it come from?
That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All...
He's coming! He's going to hurt me!
Jimmy, how's the -
Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?
Lois, I . . .
Maybe you wanted to.
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
Lex...Lex, how could you do that to Otis?
A bikini! I'll need to buy a new bikini, Lex.  C'mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ?
Well done, Miss Teschmacher.
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
Where?
North.
Ahhhhhh -- Alpha Waves.
Oh my Fullness, as I explained to you before, I am about the best there is. Second best there is.
He flies as well, then . . .
He has powers as we do . . .
Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.
Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did you see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful . . .
Perhaps a small . . . incentive, your 									Ultimate. A tiny bauble to help me jog my memory . . .
Put down Lex Luthor !
So this is the planet Houston . . .
He's captured Non!
They make my eyes itch.
What about here?
He's a jerk. I never noticed it before. Seems like a lot of people I know are jerks . . .  . . . Maybe you think the same thing about me. That's why you keep avoiding me.
Then prove it. Lois is doing an interview with Superman about his peace mission . . .
Hi. Is dinner ready? I'm famished.
I'm not so sure you do.
Boys, old Lex has a secret recipe in this dish . . . call it a genetic stew. You help me place it on one of your missiles and I promise you . . . if Superman throws it into the sun, he'll get the biggest surprise of his life. I'll be able to introduce Superman to his first nightmare . . . a Nuclear Man!
Not so fast!  All trips are canceled. We pay for wire services. And what we don't get from them, we'll invent.
I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.
Where's Clark?
He missed the door, Uncle Lex.
Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here?
Hey! He looks . . . normal.
You think he'll find us.
Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
I am an experiment? I am freako?
Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
Look closely at his cell structure. See anything familiar?
I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better  --  he needed more energy, more power.
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
I know, but  --
You're a great architect, Albert.
But Mr. Luthor, sir, I already  --
Yes, Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it.  The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target!
It was hot, yes.
You and Lois, you get all the action.  There she is, out in the wild West and everything.
Some people aren't the athletic type.
You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
Big night coming up?
Oh, not really. I guess I'll just watch a little TV and --  --  unless...would you be interested in dinner?
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
Is that what they're calling him?
Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms?
What can I tell you? He's my leader.
My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land."
This??
So I've noticed.
Shut up.
I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
You've been under such a strain. And I've ...I've --  -- neglected you. Mea culpa! Y'know.
This all has something to do with Superman, doesn't it?
What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
You can't do this to me!
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
Guess I'd better hitch up the rig and come back to get that...that thing he was settin' in. What do you make of that thing? Martha? You listening?
-- as we will be.
But why Earth, Jor-El. They're practically animals.
He'll be weightless.
There are none of them any good anyway.
Here's the story on that East 19th Street murder spree. Page one with a banner headline seems about right to me.
You've got me? Who's got you???
The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
It must feel great.
There.
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
I broke the man out of prison --
Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
Nice! Most of California would have been destroyed. Millions of people would've been killed! The West Coast as we know it would have  --
Yes.
That's where I'm going.  To see her.
What...does it turn to?
I hope she gets better.
How is Nicole?  Is she around?
Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me.
I have to.
You talked about it?
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.
Yes.  The old-fashioned way.
You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
Yes.  He does.
You've talked to Billy?
What other people?
What do you think?
You hate it.
Oh, it's bizarre alright.  C'mon Bear.  Let's get you out of here.
I didn't ask if you wanted milk.
How was it?
It's interesting.
There was nothing reckless in Mrs. Driscoll's behavior?
Note my objection.  She said, 'As I'm talking.'
Will you be spending more than a night?
She...she was a friend of mine.
I'm in a car wash.
You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
I can hear you breathing, Daddy.
If you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp...
Who are you?
No.
The Walkers spoke very highly of you.
Yes.
Excuse me?
Yes.
And where did you sit that morning?
My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?
Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?
Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.
It's okay.
Great.
How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.
I don't know.
But Charlene...
How are you tonight, Mr. Falco?
Did she accept?
Excuse me, Steve.  I said namely you shouldn't go around wild, blaming people without justification.
Boys, this gets nobody nowhere - you're over excited, Steve and -
Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.
You told him that?
Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.
I see Bartha gave you cold tongue for supper.  Hey, wait a minute!
Take it easy, Susie.  He wouldn't be much of a man if he didn't understand my concern.  Would you, son?
Does he have to be here in our hair?
Why, has he bothered you before?
Nuts!  I'm not here as an artist! I'm here as an average Joe, who happens to love your sister Susie!
I don't take kindly to you and Falco selling me ethics.  Who's the injured party here, you?
If looks could kill, I'm dead...
But my day with Susie isn't over yet and--
Sidney is a liar!
Susie, did you know about this accusation...?
Susie, I'm sorry if---
Hello, Harry.
Can I come in for a minute?
I know Manny Davis.
You print them, don't you?
J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it!
Yes.  With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
I like that, too.  Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion.  We're going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs...He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze.  Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze! - You know, J.J. - the porcupine bit - needles.
Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
- He's got them on him.
What's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates?
I don't think so.
Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha?
Do you think you could do something, Sidney?
Yeah!
This sort of thing!
Next time I'll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling!
Nothing I didn't think of you before.
He wants me to break a leg?
Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
You watch him, Al, I s...s...stutter!
No, I don't mind.  I'm busy too.
You're touchy, Sidney - don't be so touchy...
Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...
No!  I'm saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother!
You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
Do you know about the chip?
What chip?
No one must follow your work.
My mission is to protect you.
We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
Pain causes it?
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
Drive faster.
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.
It, John.  Not him.  It.
I know!
Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.
But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press.
Basically.  The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.
I have detailed files.
And no elbows on the table!
Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
I guess so, sir.
So what is it?
The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
You see, Wilhelm, I'm talking about ordinary, everyday reasons. Which is why I want to discuss your private life.  How many illegitimate children do you have?
Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwängler?
Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?
Yes.
Three months.
Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.
But... he only wrote nine, Major.
No. Ours was damaged.
Or maybe you called Goebbels or Goering? You were so close you were in the same shithouse as them.
May I ask a question?
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwängler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert,  So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
Then you are wrong.
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one?
I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return.
Was looking at Furtwängler like that?
Conscientious, determined, dogged.
Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor?
It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtwängler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.
Mission control to Chuck, come in...
I had him hooked.  He was just about to ask me out. I could tell.
You're a big help.
That bum.  So what if he has a Porsche, he can't treat you like that...it's Friday night for crissakes.
What's it to ya?
Compared to me she is.  How come you're not at the cash anymore?  They catch ya steal- ing?
Do you understand?
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?
That's good.  Now, seven more like that while I make fuses.
I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...
Hot dogs?
Someone?
I don't think I like this.
...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won.  Taking out Connor then would make no difference.  Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.
You go naked.  Something about the field generated by a living organism.  Nothing dead will go.
Give me the short version.
It probably will.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  Why should I settle for that?
Because it's fair.  Give me next quarter.  If you still feel this way, vote your shares...
Christine!   Mister Van Orton is a valued customer...
Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.
I'm so sorry.
Don't help me, just get more napkins. And soda water.
I want to know what's going on.  Are you part of this?
What's with him?
Don't just stand there, get help!
This can't be real...
This is nuts.
You first.
They'll love that.
You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
We hang down here and drop.  The garbage'll break our fall.
I'm tired.  I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance.
It wasn't his fault.  He thought it was his only way back.  They fleeced him real good.
I saw them kill him!
Okay... okay...  I put it down.  Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door.  He's an actor...
It is.  It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money.  Nobody stole anything.  They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...
I have to show you...
Hi.  Didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
Originally, Connecticut.
Studied acting, I assume?
Underwear?
Really?
For you.
Trust me.  Call that number.
Do it for YOU.
Tell me where we're going.
What's this all about, Connie?
Who?
C.R.S.  Who do you think?  Jesus H., thank your lucky charms.  To think what I almost got you into.
It's them.  They did this.
How do you know?
How did those... ?
Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry!  How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ?
There's nothing to forgive.
It's just a t.v.  He's just an actor.
We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.
I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
No, thank you.
May I make two suggestions... ?
Guess!
Dinner's in the oven.
All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
Did you worry about him?
I'll send your regrets.  Honestly, why must I even bother?
Hey... !
I wasn't expecting you.
Don't ask.
Nicholas...
Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
Well, I... uh...
You're not telling us something.
All night?
And that will be a good place to end this study.
No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
You wrote that you had trouble sleeping.
Yes.
Are you coming to confess?
I hadn't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance.  Mass hysteria is like a story, Nell.  A communal story.  Someone starts it.  Then we all add a little more to it. And then for some reason -- no one knows how -- we start believing it.  This story shapes what we see and hear.  We interpret everything through it, make it fit the story. I started our story when I gave you the history of Hill House. You've added to it.  That's what this experiment has all been about.  That's what it was about, the experiment's over.  I'm pulling the plug.  This is my fault.
You hear the vibrations in the wire.  There's a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it.  I could test it.
When do we take the tests?
Is she asleep?
Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker.  What are you doing here?
Why would we --
This?  It's from a thrift shop.
It's all I could afford.
Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?
If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him.
How could he have left without his keys?
David?
Theo... Did you?
Why?
I've never had a pedicure before.
Are you sure?
This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting!
Is there anything in the world that you want or need?
Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
Is that a problem?
Not for you, clearly.
Am I a thing?
What kind of food?
Anything but Japanese.
Why?
That's what Gordon's always saying.
Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
Why not?
What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
I thought he was in prison, in England.
You should have let me do the talking.
Where do <u>you</u> think he is, Mike.
Boomerang.
I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face.  I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years.
Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
Sod that.  Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.
And that's where you met Jenny.
Has he?
Bring the motor around.  Bang out in front, right?
What post office?
Not no more, they ain't.  I quit that acting shit, man.
... Reminds me of Jennifer.
How d'you mean?
What was that, then?
Here, aren't you gonna let me in.
Weren't you on a television series?
Said it went on for donkey's years.
She never told Eddie, though.
I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
Why not.
What do you think.
What about your grandmother?
Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
You can't count on very many people, that's the trouble.  Number of times a decent job's been cocked up ...
Well, I'll tell you.  I believe this Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money.
Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.
As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.
My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.
Sorry.  Wasn't me.
Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.
Been away a lot.
I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.
Which kind?
Good luck.
... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?
Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?
I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.
Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
You walked.  What the hell are you doing here.
So why would he want to see you.
Have we met?  There's something I can't quite --
Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
What.
Who?
...Uh-huh.
Birdy--
I can get it, yeah.
Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance.
...it just goes to show, when one door slams shut, another one opens. Here's to ya, uh...
Maybe.
No problem!
Sure.
...Just a second here, I'll give you a receipt on the, uh... Whoa, Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm gonna call the place Tolliver's, after me, you know, I didn't think you were much interested in, uh--
How ya doin', Ed?
She's a rare one.
Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
But it's...
I'd understand if you'd walked in here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. I deserved it.
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
...What a knucklehead.
I know all about that. But I don't know how much to tell them.
Should I... should I tell you why?
...OK.
I knew about it. Big Dave told me about it, and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money.
It was Big Dave's.
OK, we forget the blackmail. *You* killed him. How come?
Will anyone say they saw you there? On your way there? In there? On your was back?
So... who... who actually--
Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home.
'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um. Frankly, Doris'd be better off with the county defender.
So--
Well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't know how you're fixed for money.
Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?
...Did you make that up?
That was quite something.
He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
...Ed?
The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.
Yeah.
Huh?
Yeah.
I don't know... How it keeps on coming. It just keeps growing.
You don't got a headache?
They sent us to tell ya. We pulled the detail.
Yeah--
...Yeah, it's a tough break.
I'm telling you, something's wrong. I still haven't heard from Pendergast.  I think you should call it off.
I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches.
Forget it!
To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while...
Apparently it's huge.
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?
We've met.  The Hacksaw Murders.  '89.
Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
With all due respect, dear, that's bull.  You dance rings around me with your new technology.  You've left me in the dust.
Come on.  I'll walk you back to the elevator.
I can't help thinking there's something that Pendergast overlooked.  If the scratches were made by whatever killed Beauregard, it wants something that's in here.
Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge of something huge.  Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room.  What if John was right.  I mean, what if?  And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates.  When it got to the museum, it hatched.
How many storage areas are there?
I don't know.  It was walled over.  No one's been down there in years.
I don't want to go this way.
They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
If I spent half the time on my Fractal Evolution thesis that I spend on this fly rod, I'd have my PhD.
Eats them?
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI. Forgive me.  I guess I was snooping. What is this?
If he were alive he'd have contacted me.
You're not.  Where is it?
Is there another way around?
I think... it means it's full.
You smell that?
I want to book a flight to Fiji.
When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, you do lose a day on the way there?
The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.
That and a fat, new contract.
People forget it takes the <i>population</i> of an entire country to keep the show running.
Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--
We've learnt about life as Truman has and, despite the complaints of a minority, it's been an overwhelmingly positive experience, for Truman and for the viewing public.
<i>A show.</i>  Then who am I?
What's he doing?
Why not?
That's right.  Lauren.
I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.
Yeah?  Outta what?
I've got to talk to you.
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
No.  Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...
Things.  Things that doesn't fit.  Maybe I'm being set up for something. You ever feel like that, Marlon?  Like your whole life has been building to something?
No.
Hi, honey.  Look at this.  It's a "Chef's-Mate."  Dicer, slicer and peeler in one.  Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe.
--We could bum around the world for a year on that.
This'll pass.  Everybody thinks like this now and then.  Come to bed.
What're you doing down here?
I know.
I have to talk with you.  But not here.  Let's go for a walk.
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
Truman, that was our house!
You're the one talking to the walls!
No.  You said, "Do something."  Who were you talking to?  Tell me!
You know surprises aren't good for me. You should really call before you come over, dear.
It was Dad, I swear, dressed like a homeless man.  And you know what else was really strange?  A businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus.
I'll try.
The whole area's being evacuated.
They're going to stop me talking to you.
How's it going, Truman?
I think you better tell us.
Well, we're FBI agents.
Why don't you go home to the old lady --
You got some kind of business with him?
Have you examined them?
How's that?
Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau --
Not according to the men in blue.
You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
What was it?
What do you think?
Yeah, well I don't have them all.
Mulder -- it's me --
How's that?
Something's not right...
They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
It's like jelly.
I'd been told as much.
What did you find?
Mulder --
I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
I don't know, Mulder.
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this.  Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.
This is weird, Mulder.
Scully --
We've got to keep moving.
Where are we?
We're going to the morgue.
About what?
And they want to blame us?
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
-- if it looks bad, it's bad for the FBI --
What are you doing?
A virus?
I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
Where is he?
The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.
Did we go sailing?
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about.  Want to come?
I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
What's wrong?
I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With dinner.
Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
I still don't understand why I can't do this... This isn't some "troubled kid" you're dealing with.
You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.
You think you can do this, don't you?
Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.
What happened?
What now?
Already there.
Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano.  Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it's just sitting there.
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
Into Stargher.  Inside...
Awaiting his arrival.
Someone looking after her little girl?
Let's give old Carl a call.  Tell him he's got company.
Well, I saw you at the funeral.
You were in love with him, weren't you?
What's she talking about?
Oh, what was the name of that doctor? Harry's doctor?
Drink?
Gestern bein heurigen...
If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
What are you going to do?
Here, it will be cold on that train.
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
Of course I didn't tell Calloway.
Do you know this man?
I don't know.
Where?
We are interested in this case. Have you arrested the girl?
My name is Calloway.
When did you see him last?
What are you trying to say?
What the devil?
As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
No.
Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?
Fifty yards right down there.
...of Santa Fe."
Hmm.
Did the police believe you?
Why not?
I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
Coffee.
Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.
...the best way one can, you know.
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
Speak English?
No.
Joseph Harbin.
Should I make it all fact?
If you could see your way to lending me some cash -
I don't know - I'm American.
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
Hi.
Didn't you see <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>?
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?
Why the fuck not?
This? This is a joke.  I'll give your group a thousand bucks.
Fifty's an exaggeration. Anyway, that was a different moment. Things were possible that aren't now.
Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that --
Disease? What disease?
I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a fork-lift.
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
Is he a Nazi?
You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.
Do you know it like that? By heart.
Why?
Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.
No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You're not saved. Nobody's saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah.
Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.
No. What are you looking for?
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
Miriam called, looking for you. She said you might come, so I...
I didn't realize you cared.
And? WHat did you notice?
Jewish girls like to give head, right?
Because the Jew is essentially female.
Give me a reason not to.
You work for the <i>New York Times</i>. Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me.
I don't think you know what you are.
That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
I don't do that.
Daniel Balint.
How have things been going?
Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
Steve...
What are you doing here?
Ah, Jesus Christ, Danny, how can you wear that thing?... You know what it means? To your people...
Tell it to Hitler.
Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
Hello...?
Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the <i>New York Times</i>.
Where's Mrs. Moebius?
That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas. The guy's an animal.
I'm sorry, Danny. It won't happen again. I'm going to use a brand-new power cell. Plus we'll have a back-up timer.
They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
JTS...?
Why me?
And what did you do?
The Torah says not to light a fire on the Sabbath, because it's work, correct?  But if alternating current's running through the wires every second of every day, and I throw a switch, send it here instead of there, how is that lighting a fire?
After your mother died, that's when you stopped going to shul. Doing your homework. Everything.
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
We tested the new bomb.
Oh, fuck you...
I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods.  Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?
Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.
What's happened??
No.  He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
This is a great pleasure.
Where did you two meet?
No.
Well, good night, then...
You risk your life when you cross the street.
He can learn.  He is learning.
Enzo, what are you going to do with the money?
Great!
I don't have one.
... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask.  Am I right?
Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!
People say that?
Enzo?
Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.
Two years younger than you.
... Yes.
I give you this.  You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.
Anybody can have a bad day!
... Push me back in the water...
I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
I don't know... why?
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.
Bonjour Monsieur... Louis. 
You want to lie down for a while?
... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.
No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
Louis, we were French!
Does that have a hidden meaning?
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
It depends.  He should come up soon.  Unless he's decided to stay for the night.
Okay, okay.  You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?
Wait!  Professor...?
It was a trap. I'm back at square one.
What's up?
What do you want me to do?
Mr. Jefferson Carver?
Keep going.
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
Shabat Shalom mama. I brought some Manischewitz. The black label.
Mordechai. Do you love your mother?
Well I have news for you mom. It is good enough...I'm good enough and I won't leave here until I hear you tell me...
Anything else?
Porno? You're tellin' me that you can get porno on that thing?
So, how was I?
No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
Well, he's kinda just resting in the corner with his girlfriend.
What day is it?
My son—in—law. What do you think of him?
Why do you ask so many questions? What difference does it make how Carlos and I feel? Feeling does not buy clothes and houses!
What about me?
Then what do you do?
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
What's left of him.
Cut.
Show business?
Well, I'd best be off.
You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
It doesn't jibe with this —— you told me the leopard would go out into the country —- it wouldn't stay in the city ——
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
You know Charlie How-Come?
Come to look around?
Yes, but what sort of a man?
You know a lot. You've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that?
To the eye? Like other men.
He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.
It was you, Galbraith!
I didn't do anything. She screamed. Something frightened her.
It's better you don't know.
Tell me.
Then you found the leopard --
Why did you give up teaching?
I haven't done any posse work since last time I rode with Toni Mix at the old Bijou Theatre -- aged six, If you're interested,
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
This is l939. Can't you subtract?
What did he have to do -— look at the body?
I got into a little crap game.
Kiki?
It's a lovely town —- it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened.
Hot...  These roads all round here, closed to the public... Why’s that? Military bases?  Huh. I guess there’s space enough for war games... Must be good for business.
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says ‘closed to the public’, doesn’t it?
Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.
I found this at your brother’s.
You seem surprised. Could it be you don’t think that badly of him after all?  You needn’t worry. It seems his motives were pure. From what I can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse.
I will of course do my best to hang onto it.
Mr Lombard. Mrs De Moraes...
I’m really sorry you were not called...
You knew he had nothing to do with your brother’s disappearance, didn’t you?
I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being...
Why did you send me after Friedman? To atone for your sins?
Something like that.
Here we go again.
Crow what?
The word for those things is croissants.
Hah... What about Nathalie?
I’m finished here and I’m tired, Emily. You shouldn’t be here. Now don’t make it worse.
...I’m Emily Stewart. The hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared. The pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat. However I go about this that’s who I am. Do you get what I’m fucking saying, Mr Lombard?
Emily...
Have we done business before?
I saw the ad at George’s.  I’m passing through town and I’m in a hurry.
What sort of puppy are you looking for?
What sort have you got?
Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?
Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
I don’t know...  This is just a delivery place, man! I swear I don’t know where the kids are... I work for Martin, that’s all. Martin knows. He works for Friedman. He knows...
Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. He’s got a safe...  I need a doctor...
What colour is your car?  What colour is your car?
Hello again, neighbour. I didn’t intrude, did I?
“La collectionoose”. It’s about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. It’s on TV tonight and as I’m in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says it’s about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The director’s supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?
Well, I hope you’re not too heartbroken and...
The proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about.  His address is in this envelope with Leonard’s address, keys and other things you might need. 
My husband and I will be leaving tomorrow for a short stay in Israel. Deborah will be here if you need anything before our return.
Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. You’ve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name he’s using?
You seem very sure about that.
I told you... The rabble, it’s me...  Huh... It’s sad.
This is the hotel supervisor, Mr Lamont. I’m terribly sorry to disturb you but there’s been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.
An Austrian.
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
No! What do you want here? How do you know me?
Did Leon tell you why he didn’t want the police involved, Rhian?
Good reasons?
Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
He showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street...
How’s the boy doing?
I... How long have I been here?
Barstow’s 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever you’re heading, I reckon somebody’ll pick you up.
Uh-huh.
Où est passé ton salon?
Alors quoi?
Le montage, l’emballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors’ stuff. How much would it cost me?
A l’achat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais ça pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. C’est pas vraiment mon truc.  I don’t know any Austrian, Xavier.
Okay, shitbag. I’m only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
Are you telling me Friedman didn’t tell you I was here looking for him?
If he had, you’d be dead.
Don’t tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards.
Ha ha... Yes. With prices reaching an all time low, the name of the game has become ‘have-it- where-it’s-at’... As we all know, transportation has always been the costliest and trickiest part of this business...
Cost what?
Oh dear, why is life so complicated? Sometimes I really wish I could be someone else.
That's a good idea, sire.
Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game.
My dear Aulon...  That's fine...
Now?
Uh... they said... they will think about it.
Good.
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
But... why... what's the point?
I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!
I can't read.
Ah, yes, I forgot... God sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission!  Do you think that God made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of France?
Yes, probably... maybe...
So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
Yes, but...
No, I... I held it up to...
Calm down, my lord, I beg you!
Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is.  This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
You won't be able to drag anything from her that way.  You also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...
Whose side are you on, Cauchon?
I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church.  Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
Oh, thank you Lord!  I'm so glad to see you!  I need to confess... I haven't been confessed since Easter... or been to Mass... Will you hear me now?
Show us a little more cooperation first.  Where were you born?
I assure you they do.  So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?
What did it tell you?
Jeanne, I beg of you... sign!  In God's name, don't you understand? I'm trying to save you!  If you don't sign, the English will burn you to death!  Is that what you want??
I don't understand, Jeanne... why did you do it?  Why?
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
Don't worry, Charles.  If God is still with her, she will be victorious.  We're not her judges... we're just spectators.  Let her go to Compiegne, as you let her go to Orleans, and let God decide her fate.
My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?
Does he have hair?
And it's not the first one!  They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
There must be something we can do for her for Chrissakes!
Yes.  We can pray.
This is no good!
Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men!
Do you know how to count?
The clothes are not important...
But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?
Stop it!  What are you doing?
I swear I'll never swear again in my life if you save her life!  But I'm warning you, if you let her die, then you're the biggest...
You call this... glory...?  All this... this blood... this smell of...
Yes... a half-steed... white.
Why were you yelling like that?!
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
What do you mean, they won't come?
So your memory's coming back?
What are you doing on the wall?
My voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?
You know what you just signed, Jeanne?  You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie, an illusion.  You see?  In the end, you were the one who abandoned me...
My father's.
Oh yes... very.
Good, good.  And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?
Then... why are you here so often?
I don't want to wait for his call.
Someone you know?
Hello.
I've always loved your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
Wladek, please.
I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
How are you doing?
He'll be back before curfew.
I'll be fine.
Calm down, what, what is it?
Funny time to say this.
I haven't seen him.
We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it like this.  In full view. The Germans will search high and low, I promise you, they'll never notice it.
But...they won't get all of us... we'll...it's too small...there's four hundred thousand of us in Warsaw!
You sell anything?
Jehuda, give me something to do.
Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.
And what do you think you'll do while you're setting up a new line of defence? Wander round lugging your suitcases?
Yes, like a cave.
No sound at all?
Ohhh I've never been there. 
Don't answer, he low born. Jun look at him, mongrel. Your wife where she?
Good, flatish land with reliable water, why? I don't have money. What are you about?
I don't think you should have given up the piano. I will make sure you are properly taught, with music written on to sheets and...
I don't want to learn.
Spoken words?
He chopped it off
We can't leave the piano
Mama.
Who told ya this guy was in here?
You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.
If that punk and his pals decide to search ya, you'll never fool 'em carryin' it there.
Jesus, what a bundle.  Did you know he was that loaded?
I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.
What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.
You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
He was a tear-off rat.  He got what he deserved.  No sense helpin' pay his bills.
Straight north.  He was gonna take it all and run.
Doyle, can I see you a minute?
Yes sir.
I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
I picked something up on the way.
Lonnegan after you, too?
Gondorff, you gonna teach me the Big Con or not?
No signs of trouble?
Then he drove me home.  He tried to put himself away as legit, so I went right into the pitch.
You wanta wait for your share?
Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry.  He's not gonna sit still for a standard play.
How ya doin'?
Yeh, that'd be real nice of ya, Mr. Lonneman.
Never get enough, huh pal?  I'd think you'd get tired of losin', Honnigan.
A half mill on an eight to one shot. You're dumber than I thought, Lonnegan.
Hi there, Snyder.  Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh?  Somebody lose the dominoes?
Not intentionally maybe, but that don't make no difference to Lonnegan. He'll swat you like any fly.
No.  What's wrong with the front?
What does this guy want?
I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
And you expect me to come over, just like that.
Hooker!
I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit.  What I'm gonna do isn't very legal.
If you help me out, I'll pay ya back the money you owe Shaw, myself.
660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.
'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
You stayin' in or not?
What happened to your face?
Don't think I know him.
I'll make parole.
For fifteen years.
Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.
There's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with Julia Wolf that the police have overlooked.  And I think it explains everything.  You see, my father was a sexogenarian.
Yes.  He admitted it.
How are you?....  Oh, I'm Mrs. Jorgensen now....  No, she isn't here.  Is it about her father?  Well, can I take the message?
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
Another Martini --
Aren't you Nick Charles?
How do you do?  I'm sorry we have to rush.
Come on in.
Where did you hit her?
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
Only in bad weather.
But it isn't bad weather now.
Shrapnel!
Did they find any clues...  a gun or fingerprints or anything?
Well, I've got my alibi.  I was at the Public Library.  Where were you?
This gun yours?
Nothing yet to cinch it.
I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.
Just rolled them up and threw them in.
Could this be him?
I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
What're you doing here?
Did you go?
Why yes.
Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
That's all right.  Well, we'll be going.
I think we may as well sit down.
Let me go!  Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!
All right.  All right.
I don't like him.
Don't you remember....
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
I wish you'd count them.  There's a thousand dollars there.
Hello, Macaulay.  Come in.
My wife's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things.  And I'm looking after them.
I see.  I see.
You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.
I hate to bother you when you're laid up.
What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?
He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
Clyde Wynant's crazy... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this. No wonder the police think he has something to do with it.
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
I've never heard about you.
Listen.  "Studsy" Burke told me you used to be O.K. That's why I'm here. Do  they....
She don't say she is, but I figure she is -
He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
Who is she?
Can't you get to sleep?
Maybe a drink would help you.
Want a drink?
You're a fine watch dog.
Did I give it to you?
What's the matter with you?
Maybe I will.
But Wynant --- ?
No reason.  Just a hunch.  But I'm going to find out.  I'm tired of being pushed around.
This may be a little rough - you'd better let us go alone.
I wish they'd stop that.  It makes me fidgety. Do you think they'll find him, Nick?  He must be in New York....  Where do you think you're going?
Why, I believe the little woman cares.
My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
Nick!
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
Is that true?
It's the only way it makes sense.
You worked here?
Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
That's what Mr. Wynant said to me. If she re-married, all the money was to go to the children.
Baghdad.
Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be home in no time.
What?
Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
All we've got to do is make it to the top.
Should be easy going from here.  Stay on the pass straight to the dot.
Says he wanted food.  Liar.  He wanted the gold.
It's murder, and I won't be any part of it.
No.
I out rank you, that's why.
I'm the one's got the big stick.
I have to answer him.
Knock it off!
Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?
And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
You can't tell anybody about this.
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.
Not enough.  We're out numbered and out gunned.  They'd cut us to shreds.
Must be a compartment.
He's not going to leave us.
There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
No.
No.
I'm sorry about that, Epps.
I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm glad it didn't come to that.
Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
I pick that way.
It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
What did you say?
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them!
What do you make of them?
You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt.  When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.
Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?
I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
Yeah.  Even after that.  You didn't take it out on me, except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now.  But I'd say you've been very fair.  I just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple.
Well, this is it.  We get the car, find some Americans.  We find Americans we'll be all right.
Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?
Come on.  You're going to get us in trouble.
How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.
Naw, nothing.
This is so weird.  It's happening, but it's not.  It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.
The longer the air force hits the Iraqis, the safer it'II be for us when we have to engage.
If!  If there's a treasure.
I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
If there's gold.  If!
Iraqis.
So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel?  Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?
You have to go with us, Wes.
If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself.
Think we can make it?
Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.
When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic.  Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war.  They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs.  They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy.  America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out:  They can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow Americans, left me out in the desert.  They can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost.  It's almost as if they were Iraqi spies, or something.  And I've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the Iraqis.  See how I mean?
We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
Drug evasion with assorted perversions
HUMMMM.....
What happened?
Now.
Then why did you bring it up?
That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.
That's not food.  Can't be food.
No!  Don't go.
No....I though  I'm afraid.
You slipped on a T297 transfer just before lunch, didn't you?
What?
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
Are you all right?
THX and me.
I can just barely see him.  I think he's leaving.
I'm sure it's warmer in her than outside, though.  I haven't been out yet, but it usually is...the control is fouled... 
What's going on?
We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch.  She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself.  Would you like something?
I was lost.
How do you know?
Yes...
And you are...?
How's the print coming?
Dispatch, this is Reilly.
Where did you get this?
Sorry about that.  That's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do.
Now wait just a fucking-
Anything else I should know?
She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?
Oh yeah? Prove it.
An abandoned machine shop... nice place to build devices. Low rent, too. But, you and Rice ruined their perfect hideout.
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
This is where the van was parked.
Why do you do it?
Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
"Punks", huh?
What do ay say?
No... No more killing.
Who are you calling, sis?
I want to work this.
Don't talk.
Make an appointment.
Vice cop on a homicide?
Take it down to the Bomb Squad, Artie-
Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
What?  I may lose it again? But I haven't found it yet! I'm sorry. Goodbye!  Yes?
Yes.
Well, have you found it?
Pardon me, m'sieu. Madame Colet would like to see you in the living room.
M'sieu Laval, M'sieu Filiba would like very much to see you.
No!
You've never been in Constantinople?
Nice day, Major.
You're looking fine, Major.
He's really not a bad fellow.
I would start with cocktails.
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron?
But please, Baron. We're not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won't tell anybody I told you?
I was only asking if you are related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
Very well, m'sieu.
M'sieu Monescu!
The pepper, too?
No, thank you.
Gaston Monescu.
The fourteenth of May.
We'll take the Royal Suite!
What?
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
Yes.
I know that niche.
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
Naturally I did.
M'sieu Laval!
No, no, no!  I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--
What?
Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.
Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
Crimson!
Like that?
Like that!
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
Oh, that's too bad. You see, I wanted her to do something.  Well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.
Oh, no, it's the way you lead.
No, madame, it's the way you <u>follow</u>.
Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years.  I was a school friend of your husband's ...
About what?
Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
For all the really important things--
That's true.
Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six.
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right? Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic. At the age of 17. If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now.
We've put together the world's largest database on the Titanic. Okay, here...
Don't drop it Rose.
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
Rose Calvert.
Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.
What made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! Look at me, you filth! What did you think you were doing?!
I had hoped you would come to me last night.
I was tired.
Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
Something serious has happened.
I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
Keep pulling... away from the ship. Pull.
I don't understand a one of you. What's the matter with you? It's your men back there! We got plenty a' room for more.
We've struck ice.
Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
And...?
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
May I cut in, miss?
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.
I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.
When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.
Could it have damaged the ship?
You jump, I jump, right?
Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.
Is your stateroom alright?
I tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was, Rose?
I can explain--
Thanks. I'll be there. About seven-thirty?
Will you pardon me?
You're coming back--
So you washed it off!
Good-by.
You're not very ambitious, are you?
Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.
Never eat before the show.
Isn't she attractive?
But--
This time I'm really glad you showed up.
I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
You can't lose me, Sally--I'm no lily myself!
Make it five.
If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship. 
You don't think--?
Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
Change?
Here's your twenty-five hundred, Mr. Brett.
Coming to the pool for a swim?
Don't get yourself all worked up--
Tell you what I'll do.  I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
How?
Wait a minute--I think I can cut something else out.  "Back in four weeks." Instead of "in four weeks"--say "next month"--That saves another word.
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
Women are such fools!--Why do so many of us pass up <U>right</U> guys?
Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!
So what?
Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--
Then, after the first number, I tell the one about the Scotchman trying to open a Pullman window--the Scotchman says to the window--"Gee you're tight."-- and the window says--"You loosen up a bit and so will I."--Good?--And then I do the one--  Oh--you don't like it, eh?
Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
Eh?... Oh.
That's him! That's the sucker!!
I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
Of course not--  --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
It's getting kind of chilly on deck. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to bed. Good night, Mr. McKinney!
Say, "Thanks very much!"
That's the truth--every single word!
I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.
There you are, sir.
He's certainly good-natured.
I thought I had our sailing covered up--  --and here it is.
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
God damn son of a...
Isn't that a daisy?
Newcomers, eh?  Names John Behan, I'm Cochise County Sheriff.  Just Hit town?
Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-
Gave all that up.  Going into business.
Yes, very.  And very married.
I saw that look on your face just now. What's between you and Wyatt?
Not now.  I don't have time.
Look, I don't want any trouble With you but that's my horse and I mean to have him back.  One way Or another.
Credat Judaeus Apella.
Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.
Been hittin' it awful hard, Doc.
Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings.  Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason.
Hey Creek, you ever see anything Like that before?
I laugh sometimes
You mean Behan?  Then why are you with him?
So I assume we're regarding this As just a kind of interlude.
Sorry about your friend.  And I'm sorry about...
Those Cowboys're tellin' Everybody in town they're gonna Clean you out.  They're down in That lot right now behind the OK Corral.
Come up to the fire, honey.
Oh, all right.
Out ridin'.  So... how you doin'?
Well hello, Sherm.
Give him some good exercise?  Sure Some stud.  Some string in fact. What're you gonna do, race 'em?
Well what do you think happens When you die?
Come on, we're not about pickin' Fights.  Just gonna keep a little Order, that's all.
How you doin', boy?
Morgan, are you crazy?  They're Out gunning for us!  What the Hell're you doin'?
What's it look like?  They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.
You were right, Wyatt.  They got Me good.  Don't let 'em get you Too.
Easy Morg, don't think about that now.
Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.
Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.
Talked it over.  We decided we Don't need the money.  Took out 13 Dollars each, though.  Federal Posseman's fee.  That all right?
You know, I was thinkin', maybe We ought to open our own place. That's the real money.  Build it Up, milk it for all it's worth, Then sell it off for a bundle and Breeze out of this burg with more Money than Croesus and ready to Live like kings.  Let's you and me Take a walk around town, Virge, See if we can scout us out a Couple of nice lots.
Pretty fun too, isn't it?
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt.  It's-
Billy Clanton, Wes Fuller, and Billy Claiborne.  Now there's six Of 'em.  This is like a bad dream.
I appreciate your assistance, M. But this is now a military operation.
Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.
You see, Mr. Bond, you and I are both men of action. But your era is passing. Words are the new weapons; satellites the new artillery. And make no mistake about it: In the right hands, they can be as deadly as your Walther PPK.
Briefly.
...And what's that, my dear?
Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.  My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.'
I'm sure she is, James. But I'm afraid you'll have to 'kiss off' the rest of your lessons this afternoon.
Moneypenny! We've got to stop meeting like this. They may be on to us.
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
... 17 Beverage cup holders?
Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you?
What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is this just another one of your stunts?
Shhhhh...
Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?
Now pay attention, 007. We haven't much time to demonstrate your new Q toys.
That's reassuring.
I don't know if you'd call it a boat...
Something with an engine? Not oars?
I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
Yo! Jimbo! I won five hundred -  What happened?
They'd never sail this close to the shore.
Married?
Bourbon. Neat.
Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. Be reckless.
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
Actually, I'm here on business. You might say it was a... Golden opportunity.
I see my date is here.  And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.
And what do you call this?
If I were you -
Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.
That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
Harmsway sank that ship and stole the gold. It's on the Sea Dolphin II.  And thanks to your little show and tell -  - giving him the evidence -  We're the only ones who can tie him to the crime.
... How did you get into marine salvage?
Not a lot of difference.
Put your back to the railing. Sit up on it.
Come in, 007. You know the Minister?
Of course.
The infrared satellite images. No heat, no flame, no explosion. If that boat went down where they said it did, there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface.
Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
My name is Sidney Winch, and -
No.
You won't get away with this!
The Queen invited you to dinner -
How is it now?
...Well! I do believe this requires further investigation!
That was too close.
Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.
Please sir. Please -
Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?
Why in the hell didn't you help mama?
I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof, you would have rebuilt the whole damn house.
You okay?
It was nip and tuck.
Never play with someone's else's cards. You always get a new deck. Look at this card. See anything?
Your feet are cold.
You know, Babe Brother's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them.
No, I'm too hot now.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
But these are white people, anybody. The punch...
Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.
Man, put your boxes down and stay as long as you like. We have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out.
Everything these days is made overseas.
Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don't plant old ways...  ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you.  It's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. You sell it to a stranger. You worked your whole life, for what?  I doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. All what we've experienced has no meaning.
My daddy called me boy up to the time he died. I was always boy to him.
Haven't the years been good to Hattie?
Harry, you know everything.
You must have done something to her.
Now who are we talking about?
That's nice.
Harry, that's not nice. I'm in church now.
Well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance. Don't take me wrong but you can't judge people by how you act. You're a caring person.
You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child.  In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since.
I thought you weren't old fashioned.
How are you?
I didn't mean for you to pay me for that.
Next stop...
Which one can I open first?
Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.
Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
What are you doing over there?
Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
I could have stopped him.
Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble!
Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!
Woody, stop it!!
Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
Come on, this way!
I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
Woody!  It's the moving van.
Woody?!  What are you doing?
Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!
I dunno.
Whaddaya mean, you don't know?
Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear?
Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.  I'm not worried.  You shouldn't be worried.
Wait a minute.  You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?
Wait just a minute.  What are you trying to pull?!
Toss 'im overboard!
ROOAAAARR!!!
Sargent.  Establish a recon post downstairs.  Code red.  You know what to do.
There.
Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!
Reach for the sky!!
I'm red this time.
Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!
There's no mirror.
I like plaits.
Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles.
Finn, there's a splinter in your left foot.  If you don't let me take the splinter out, it will fester.
Well ... yes. All right. But -
The swan was so ridiculous. All the same, it did scare me.
Finn ...
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
It was only a mouthful!
I'm Melanie.
I want to believe you.  I really do.
Good.  From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it?
Got it?  Good.  Do not discuss anything over the telephone.  Do not talk to the neighbors.  Stay out of your yard.
If all our assets are frozen and our "sales force" has scattered...  How am I supposed to survive?  I'm giving birth in three months.  How do I get through this?
I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.
It's the same stuff?  From the rainy day stash?
Don't bother.
That's frustrating.
My Leica's gone.
So's the video camera.
Are you going to?
He didn't hang around us.  He's like one of those hippie kids.  I'm not part of that group.  It was a party in all these rooms.  His girlfriend who I barely know was completely hysterical... He's blue, he's puking... We didn't want to get in trouble, but what were we supposed to do?  I mean, what would you have done if you had been us?
How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.
Yes.
I get A's.  All A's.
I feel good.
I'm telling you, she doesn't know shit.
So does half of San Diego.
Depends who it's from.
All the professionals keep them in the trunk.
You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.
I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.
They're going to walk right past me.
Carlos, I mean Carl, started out in the family connection business: real estate in Tijuana, fishing boats out of Ensenada, hydroponic raspberries. He met up with the Obregon brothers of the Tijuana Cartel who were interested in two things: entering society and using his fishing boats.
You expect me to be grateful for spending the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.
You're breaking my heart.
My husband had been working on something he called, The Project for the Children.  Are you aware of this?
I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
That's good coke.
If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
That's your past.  I want to talk about your future.  Would you be willing to do something for me?
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
It's possible.
Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
Noriega is a criminal.
Who the fuck do you think you are? Where the fuck do you think you are? Why the fuck do you think I shouldn't just put you in a dumpster?
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year.  But, you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force.  We get a tip that he is one place, then we get there and he is already gone, having been warned by someone on our side.
He died in a liposuction surgery, right?
I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side?
For fuck's sake.
Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on.
Yes, you fucking do. I've seen your statement.
Jesus.
Thanks.
Where's that?
Diane.
Ssshh!
No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the living room, or go home. It's up to you.
Calm down. You're not going to jail.
Easy for you to say.
I wouldn't mind a bit, if it is.
It's Iggy Pop.
Oh, yes, indeed. I look back on my time there with great fondness and affection. The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather --
No, actually I went to Craignewton but I was worried that you wouldn't have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh College instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details, yeah? People get all hung up on details, but what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When? Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one, but that's not important. What's important is that I am, right? That I am.
I'll put the sheets in the washing machine just now.
No, I'm clean.
Now remember --
You Only Live Twice?
Director?
The park?
Roald Dahl.
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it here.'  Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?
I can't believe you did that.
What?
Come on, Mark, every cunt knows you've been saving up down in London.
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
What's on the menu this evening?
The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
Such as?
Went ballistic?
What?
Homeless people?
It was not. The Barrier stood between us - but we breached it.
But the shuttle-
You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet.
What's going on?
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
Your pain runs deep.
Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
Don't you worry, Captain. We'll beat those Klingon devils even if I have to get out and push.
Scotty here, Captain. Transporter is still inoperative. Even if we could lock onto the hostages, we couldn't beam them up.
Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.
Why didn't you beep my communicator?
Bird of Prey bearing one zero five mark two.
MM.?
On the contrary. Gravity is foremost on my mind. Look, I'm trying to make an ascent here. Why don't you go pester Dr McCoy for a while?
Concentration is vital. You must be one with the rock.
Oh. I believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the singalong.
I could use a shower.
Who is it he reminds you of?
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...
There, you see? See?
I have a half brother.
Exactly. That is correct. Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess. Upon her death, Sybok and I were raised as brothers.
If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
Spock.
Spock... don't.
I must have your starship.
No... I didn't.
What makes you think I won't turn us around?

And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
Easy, easy,  easy, Scotty. Easy. You're back with us.
I am a Starfleet Officer.
Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...
I don't get it.
Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?
Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
Okay, okay...
You call that getting over it?
What for?
To warn him.
Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
I hope you don't think it's me. I don't even balance my checkbook on downtime.  I've got a Honeywell at home for that.
And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...
It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
That was uncalled-for.
What, just the three of us?
Wrote the...?
But -- if you're a User -- then everything you've done has been part of a plan ...
Hey... you guys OK?
Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
We have to talk.
But-what if I can't...?
Wait...I need that...
Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
Hey, did that guy Harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet?  Cause apparently that's the only way we're going to catch the son of a bitch --
He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
Same thing happened to me with wife two.  I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty.  I mean empty.  She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge.  What kind of person would think of that?
I still don't believe it.
You tell on me, I tell on you.
Any minute now.
Yes sir.
This is Samir.  See if you can guess his specialty.
Hi, honey.  How was the flight?
I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
...and I'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable...  really wild.
I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch.
They must've just missed me.
He needed my help.
Let me handle this part.  Do you mind?  Why did you go to Carlos' hideout?
Yes.
I don't know.  I guess I needed something...
Yes.
I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
Tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again.
Sorry.  Trade secret.
What does she do?
Beat it.
Where were you?  On a... uh,					* mission?
Worse than Cairo?							*
Yes.
And you chased one?
To our assignment.
Find out who this Renquist it.
How?
Hello, Alabama.
That was so good I am gonna have another.
How long have you worked here?
That's a long time.
What's that?
What's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do?
You're a whore?
Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.
It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself."
You will?
Why?
You don't know him -
Was it him or you?
I think what you did...
Cancoon.
It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.
Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
I'm hip.
Naw naw!
Yeah.
He don't got no right to live.
If I thought I could get away with it -
Who the fuck are you?
It's great to hear from you.
Good for you.
Did you meet Captain Kirk?
You're really in love, aren't you?
Drexl's dead. This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he wants with it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama are gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'. So, you got my letter, have you lined up any buyers?
The zoo.
The zoo.  What are you waiting for?
In case.
Do you really mean it?
What do you think, eightball?
Yeah?
Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.  Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.  He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.
Anything stronger?  Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?
I really don't know.
You got it all worked out, don't you?
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley?
I'm the Anti-Christ. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is Vincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man your son stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard od us before. Am I correct?
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  Want a Chesterfield?
Oh, don't bother. I got one.  So you're a Sicilian, huh?
Come again?
I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
We talked him into it.
Not a tiny little vial -
But a fuckin' baggie.
No don't sit here and feed us some shit.
Or a bit player -
He saw the wire.
Rock whores.
You see what you get when you fuck wit me, white boy? You're gonna walk in my goddamn house, my house! Gonna come in here and tell me! Talkin' smack, in my house, in front of my employees. Shit! Your ass must be crazy.  I don't think that white boy's got good sense. Hey, Marty.  He must of thought it was white boy day. It ain't white boy day, is it?
Nigger, get outta my face with that bullshit.
I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
I'm not wearing a bra.
Yes.
No, sir!
But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.
It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
So that...???
Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
You wouldn't understand.
I have to go.
I love this air.  This is wonderful air.
Do you know what year it is?
No, 1995 is the past.
Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
Look, I'm warning you.  You do anything, I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!
Who's keeping an eye on you?
Mason???
I need help all right.  They're coming after me.
Give me the gun.
Just like that?  You were in prison?
You... you left them a message?
I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.
Germs?!
It's private.
Never saw him before in my life.  Go ahead and shoot him or torture him or whatever it is you do.
That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
County Hospital, right?  1989.  The "Immaculate Escape" -- am I right?  Why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too.
I mashed the spider, didn't I?
I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
One dozen bolt cutters!  Whadda you gonna do with one dozen bolt cutters?
You really want to know?
James Cole.  That's everything we got.  None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing. You want me to go in with you?
What?  What did you say?
You want something, old man?
Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
It's a Movado.
Can I help you, sir?
How much.
You want somethin'?
You own this place?
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
Nothing.
She's all yours. Put a new hose in it, and she runs like a dream now.
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back.  You don't look so good.
Two-hundred.
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket. That's going to run you another fifty.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
Take it.  As soon as I get my money. Fifty dollars for an almost new gasket.  You don't know what kind of a deal you're getting.
We ain't got no Beck's.
No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.
No.  We got Miller.  Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?
Poor thing.  Is she all right?
That yours, Mrs. McKenna?
Is that the way you want it, boy?  A bullet in the head in the middle of the desert?  Ends like this and you won't be able to spend a dime of that blood money.
. . .at the very least.  I know there was more than thirty-thousand dollars.  Now, how much did you get?
Who was that on the phone?
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
I got it.
Accident.
Wasn't nothing.
Yes, I have.
You're welcome, Grace.
All over.  Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.
Where you headed?
Somewhere else.  I've never been anywhere else.  Just once.  Years ago.  Went to the state fair.  It was nice, but it wasn't nothing.
Nice place you got here.
Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.
You never did answer my question.
Still playing?
All this nothing?  I've spent my life in this stinking desert.  It doesn't get to Jake like it got to me.  He doesn't mind being out here. He doesn't mind being nothing but a land broker.  Big fish in a small pond, he says.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
Have you ever been there before?
Yeah.
It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.
What was I supposed to do?
There's easily a hundred-thousand in there.  More than that.
Let's do it here.
I . . . nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell . . . that's all.
John . . .?
I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
I can't make it.  Grace?  Grace!?
It's not locked.  I left it open when I took out Jake's body.
Bullshit, Grace.  You were going to drive off and leave me here.
Someone will find me.
At least I'll have company when I die.  Ain't that right, Jake?
What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so.
I . . I was helping your wife.  I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
I have half a mind to--
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life.  Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
I hope so.  Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
Hey!
Like you don't know.
Nice office you've got.
Talk?  About what?
You meant it.
Twenty-thousand?  I don't have that kind of money.  I won't get the insurance until months after she's dead.  I don't imagine you'll want to be around after poor Grace's demise.  Twenty-thousand; that's more money than I could ever get my hands on.
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before.  I guess I should have hired a professional.
You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?
Drop it, Jake.
And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.
It's not like that.
Jake--
There's another reason?  It better be good.
You're not talking sense.
Honest, Toby.  I just asked him for a quarter for the jukebox.
Got any requests?
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her.  How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
For what?
But you was going to fight for me.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
What the hell are you talking about?
I wasn't doing anything.
Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
Let me guess.  This robber; he gets your money.
Let me get this straight:  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
Do you understand me you little fuck?
Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.
I think you might just want to do as I say.
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
You want something, old man?
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Hell no!
So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
Stand up.
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
Say, what happened to your hand?
Would I what?
Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
I'm not your boy.  I don't like you.  I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience.
Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I <u>know you</u>...  This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
I guess this is what they call "ironee"? Hunh?
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me...
I came for Grace.
Hey mister. Mister, I just... I just wanted to thank you.
Yeah, I can fix it.
Twenty-after-ten.
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
I don't have a goddamn credit card.
You've been there?
You believe that?
Yeah, but it was shot.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.
All I got's a hundred, Darrell. You got change?
That's right on my way.
No, I've got it.
Wasn't nothing.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
You're welcome, Grace.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.
A medicine man?
My face tell you all that?
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
Doesn't the isolation bother you?
Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?
What do you mean?
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
Bobby?  What the hell's the matter with you?
I don't know about that?
He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...
Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past...
And I love you too.
There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit.  Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.
Yeah, if you could send it care of...
Beck's.
Heineken?
Virgil!  Now look at what you done!  Are you all right?
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?
They look nice.
You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl!
I axed you a question.
Where's the fire sweetheart? Don't know how they work things in Nevada, but we got speed limits in this state.
Is Noel in?
I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death.
Four.
I'm listening.
I don't know. It's been a while.
Oh shit...
...When you work with clients on machines, do they sometimes just jump up a level or two? Do something they didn't know they were capable of?
Would you like to try going--
Yes.
What was that?
Maybe it wasn't a specific moment, maybe it--
Seventy-five percent? That's not nearly good enough for me. I'm extremely skeptical.
Just give me a minute.
Is there a problem?
Like what?
Quick.
Stop messing with my life Elijah. My son almost shot me last night. He wanted to prove you were right.
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
Yeah?
I'm going to go in.
You think you could beat up Mike Tyson? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears?
No Jeremy.
What do you do if something happens?
That was me they were talking about. I almost died. That was me.
You are in the emergency room of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. You were in a serious accident.  How's your vision?
You and my mother would have a special connection.
Is this a religious thing?
I fined 'em instead.
We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
You told them cowboys you had it.
Where's Little Bill for Christ sake?
I couldn't find no bullwhips, Bill. The German...
He tell you where them others is?
He give 'em names?
Some big guy beat the shit out of me.  I guess I must look a lot like you, huh?
You don't look nothin' like me, mister.
Shit and fried eggs.
You could run off them two cowboys.
Uh, no. No, I ain't drunk.
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
Uh... I can assure you, Mister Daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and...
Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.
But he was called...
Well, that bullet whizzin' by panicked Corky, an' he done the wrong thing! Pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe. Meantime, Bob aims good and squeezes off another... but he's so drunk he misses again an' hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar. Well, now the Duck of Death is good as dead 'cause this time Corky does right an' aims real good, no hurry...
But... if he doesn't miss?
Uh... Sheriff... Uh...
Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
Who killed him?
They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.
L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...
Like I was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer.
Well... you don't look so prosperous. Hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. We could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy...
She's passed on, Kid.
Huh?
What business?
Better re-load it.
You're gonna lose your share. If you don't...
Well, he's holding on to his shit like it was money.
Is it him?
Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'.
I trust you, Bill.
Wha... what f-for?
Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
P-p-p-please, I'm not armed.  M-m-my G-god. You killed... Little Bill.
Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
It ain't nothin', don't fret it.  She don't like it much, you goin' off with me.
I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her.  She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more.
I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up.
He hit you?
HEY, KID.
IS THAT YOU, KID?
The angel... the angel of death. I'm scared, Ned. Ned, I'm gonna die.
HOW MANY LEFT GODDAMIT?
I'm goin' on down to Kansas.
Well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?
I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?
&lt;&lt;We were there to buy a man and take him back to Hungary.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;No, no, no. I need a guarantee from the ridiculous man. I am going to be killed. I have seen the Devil and looked him in the eye.&gt;&gt;
Now remember, this is another kind of business. They don't earn your respect. You owe it to them. Don't stare them down but don't look away either. Confidence. They are fools not to trust you. That's the attitude.
They just said they wanted time.
Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we -
You're fuckin' A right, no P.C. Well screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right. You do some time, they never let you go. Treat me like a criminal, I'll end up a criminal.
DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.
Everybody I ever worked with, did time with.
Don't hurt me.
How are they going to do it?
What is this?
Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
Mr. Soze will be most -
What did you say?
Take your time. Enjoy L.A.
Even if I was to let you talk to him, he won't talk to you. He's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired
You wanted to know what happened after the line-up, I'm telling you.
That was all Fenster and McManus.
I don't know about that.
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling. You know what I'm getting at.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
I knew him. He would never -
You think he's..?
You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state's.
I'11 take my chances then. I'11 feel safer without a job if a man like Mr. Kint is behind bars.
How good's your intelligence?
He was accused of jury tampering.
We thought it was just.
And no one will know the truth.
... he wants to testify ...?
No, actually, she was referred to me.  She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
Yes.
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not?
Well, many reasons, actually...
You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
Neurology?
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
Through, through his book.
Meth...Methodology and Technique...
I'm on the staff of...
Nothing further, your Honor.
I . . ..
I...yes.
I...
They lied.
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
You didn't write that figure.  And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
What is this going to cost?
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up.  Who do you think you are?    Who do you think you are...?
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps.  Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
'Code Blue'...
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
The Doctors were not negligent.
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?
I'm afraid that's not true.   Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
Dr. Gruber ...
) I'm sorry ...?
Her doctors murdered her.  They gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.    Her doctors murdered her.
Well, well, when can we meet again. I'd like to get a deposition..
I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
I can subpoena you, you know.  I can get you up there on the stand.
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
That's it...?    Come on, guys...life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.    Frank:  I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand...and that's a lot of money...and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
What is it?
Thank you for seeing me.
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
Continental Casualty...
How come you're calling me from...?
Kathy Price.
We get it at work.  We get the magazine at work.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
They might.  Yes.  That's the point ...is that they might...you see, the jury wants to believe.  They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe.  I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case.   I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve.  And every one of them it's written on their face, `This is a sham.  There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe...maybe...'
Would you like me to leave...?   Is this a bad time --?
We, we...No...we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh...I have some work to do...
Why don't you get some rest?
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed.  It's all right. I'll stay here with you.  It's all right.  Come on...
Isn't there something you...
You do what you want.  You want to leave...You want to go kill yourself?
Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
It's over!
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
Joe...  Joe...
... hey, I don't need your charity ...
What do you want?
I'm going to help her.
...I have to stand up for her...
Forget it.  You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
So what?
What happened, Joey...?
That's right.
It's locked.
... we, we love her, Dick and me ...
Hi.
Uh-huh.  My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
How old is he?
Kathy Price...
Yes.
No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background.
No, to be honest, I find it dull.
You don't have to do it for a living.
No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.
No, I'm all right.
Watched her come out of the apartment, someone I didn't know... walking in a different way... holding her head in a way I didn't know; and get into her car, and drive out to...  Golden Gate Park. Five miles. She sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore, the Portals of the Past. Sat there a long time, not moving... and I had to leave, to got to the office. That evening, when I came home, I asked what she'd done all day. She said she'd driven to Golden Gate Park and sat by the lake. That's all.
Have you talked to the doctors at all?
It's not my line.
I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.
No, please! I Just want to talk to you!
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
Your name. And --
Tomorrow morning.
Don't go.
The trouble is, I'm gone now. For you. And I can't do anything about it. I want you to love me. If I let you change me, will that do it? If I do what you tell me, will you love me?
Yes.
Mmmm.
No, Ernie's is fine.
I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
I'm scared.
Take me away...
Did he train you? Rehearse you? Teach you what to say and what to do?
What are you going to do?
Some money.
No...
The Palace of the Legion of honor. The Art Gallery.
No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
Some people prefer it.
I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
You've nothing to apologize for.
What?
Good-bye.
Well... anywhere in particular?
Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
Only silence. It's always like this.
Would you like a drink of water?
Somewhere in here I was born... and here I died and it was only a moment for you... you took no notice...
The tall trees...
Why did you jump?
No, I can't tell you!
There's a name on the gravestone.
What else?
It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
Tell me.
No... we're together...
There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
Why?
It's where you belong.
To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
From that music.
Normal.
Three whole weeks.
How?
Easy, now.
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!
Pop Leibel.
For what?
You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!
Can we have it by tonight?
No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?
You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends.
You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries.
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
I'm calling the police.
So I didn't fucking do it!
Adam! Calm down.
I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
Later.
We'll be ready Adam.
That's one idea.
Are you solid with that?
I want you to hear me out.
What are you talking about?
I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
Nothing happened in Vegas.
She's not here.
She's in there!
I don't think so Boyd.
He's right.
What's goosed?
No.
What kind of words?
What did you ask me?
I just want to get married.
And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most.
I'm getting really tired of your bullshit.
Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive.
What's your point?
The need to know is clear. What did Adam tell Lois? That's the name of the game. What did Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know?
Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic. The former Pittsburgh Steeler running back, beat known for "The Immaculate Reception," his improbable sixty yard Ricochet Reception. I say Ricochet Reception has made a bold move on corporate America.  Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park Sausage Company. By taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park's, Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime.
Yea...It's great...seems like...I don't know you've got all the important stuff in there.
This is ridiculous.
Photographer?
Caterer?
I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
You don't like Moore? Since when?
He's a great chef.
That's absurd.
Seating problems.
We're leaving in three hours.
I need your help.
We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
I love you.
We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
What's the word on the chairs?
This is our honeymoon.
No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back.
Yeah. You.
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
He kept saying he was protected.
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
Well, I'm in the middle of my Goddamn toast here.
I don't care for him.
The wahoo?
I think so.
I appreciate it. I do, but...Maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit.
No...No.
I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter.
You alright?
I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing.
That's a good one.
...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape-like state...
We will.
Give them to Refugio.
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
Enedina and Paco ...
Yes, Uncle. How are you?
Did you have so little interest in seeing me?
Come down here, you scamp.
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
His mother wanted to keep him. She came from a poor family. I was in love with your aunt. I would like to have acknowledged him but I was afraid of losing her. That's why I didn't say anything.
I should like you to do something for me. It's an innocent sort of thing but I'm very set on it.
You're lying.
It's very good.
My God, what have you done to him!
Ramona! Ramona!
Not in that way; you're always looking for company.
She's mad.
Shouldn't I be? You, on the other hand ...
How in hell does it wind up?
Me, rich? Come on!
Why?
Miss Viridiana ...
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
I don't know anything about these things, Jorge ...
There's no point in helping some of them when there are so many others.
Are they going to work here too?
No.
He's good at rabbiting and he knows it. When we're in the country, if he doesn't hunt he doesn't get fed.
Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
Where?
I'm afraid.
You have decided to leave, Moncho.
She looks like a sick marrow!
Can you tell us what's on the disc?
I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device —— it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.
Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach.
Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
Barnes, where the hell have you been?!
This better not be a wild goose chase.
You've had a year—and—a—half to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
I am beautiful, aren't I?
How can I ever thank—you for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl?
You made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived.  What do you think I'm doing?
That's not true, Parker.
It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file?
What happened when he was 17?
I've been in prison, remember?
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.
Nice work.
You don't know?
What do we do now?
Where's John?
You can't die until you tell me where the C-4 is. Where is it?!
As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
Alright, well, alright:  geopolitically...
Hello, <u>King</u>.  How the heck <u>are</u> you...?  <u>Get</u> out...  <u>Get</u> out... Well, man, you fall in love like a <u>Hillbilly</u>...  Ditch the wife, toss the kids in the Pick-up,   Listen, King:  <u>Get</u> your fat redneck ass out here, <u>willya</u>...
Y'see, <u>this</u> is what Producing is:  you put me in a <u>Room</u>...
<u>IT DESTROYED THE ELECTORAL PROCESS</u>.
Who we got here...?
What difference does it make if it's true?  It's a <u>story</u>, and, it <u>breaks</u> they're gonna have to <u>run</u> with it -- How long've we got til it breaks? 
When do we bring'em back?
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
We're going to have to explain away the...
What in the <u>world</u> would do that?
Tell, tell, tell me again.
I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.
Why <u>not</u>, what've they ever done for <u>us</u>...?  Also:  they sound... Ah, you see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 <u>Bomber</u>...
Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
What did Albania ever do to us?
...can we see the Kitten...?
<u>Hello</u>... Yes.  We'll be back...?
New York Times, Wash Post, Detroit Register, San Diego BEE, all in emission.  <u>No</u> mention of the Girlscout. None.
No rain.
Get on this, right now...
...got to be <u>something</u>.  She gives him the sacred...  And tells him:  this is the Traditional Harvest Offering, given to the Man who Ties the First Sheaf, the last sheaf, whatever the fuck it is...
How long you been up, you need a nap.
You're tired, Ronnie.
...fourteen years...
What are we going to do?
...what have you <u>done</u> to me...
Guess who <u>I</u> am.
I know who you are, Mr. Ames.
And I take this <u>opportunity</u> to suggest that, equally, I admit to <u>nothing</u>, and that I would like my lawyer present.
The threat of Nuc1ear Terrorism has been quelled.  We are in <u>contaot</u> with the Albanian Premier, who assures me, and this government <u>credits</u> his assurances, that his country does not wish us ill, and <u>has</u> not.  That the threat which we perceived was not of his wish, or of his making.
CAIN, MOUTHING ALONG, WITH THE SPEECH, SHE LOOKS DOWN, AND WE SEE WRITTEN, ON HER COPY. of his making 
Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you.
Well, I'm sure that speaks very well of you and for your parents.  But if forced to choose between the security of the country and the security of your Job, which would you pick.  And, while you hesitate, permit me to suggest that they are one and the same.  Your country and your job.
What's more interesting than boffing the girlscout?
How much...?
Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh...  You're kidding.
Yes.  Indeed I did. 
Hell, I'd just do it for the <u>hell</u> of having <u>done</u> it, for a story to tell...
Because.
They got to have something that we want.
What?
He can't respond to the Allegations.  I don't care <u>how</u> many girlscouts are picketing the ... look, look, look, we're coming home with <u>Gold</u>.  Eh? Tell him to hold firm for <u>two hours</u>... coming home with Gold.
Yes, but I, well, <u>you</u> know...
Big mistake.
Getting off on the inaugural?  Gonna go...
Of what?
I thought they weren't meeting him at the airport...
Just....do what I ...look:  get me a ...hello...? Hel...?  I'm going to need an <u>ambulance</u>, we take him, the last moment, right from the Pl...no, <u>we</u> land, we puttem <u>in</u> the ambulance.  Air force jet lands, we take somebody <u>else</u> off <u>that</u> jet...what the fuck do <u>I</u> care? Somebody in a Hospital gown.  And we need a ......hello?  Hello...?
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
What the hell do <u>we</u> care?
We have no home.  We're vagrants.  N'each man's hand's against us.  We killed Old Shoe...  We killed the Schuster...spend our life in a packingcrate...Where are you <u>going</u>...?
"...unsure whether or not Enemy Action..."
Can we give'er a <u>kitten</u>?
...as of today, 89% favorable.
...you're gonna Punch in a Kitten Later.
Long's you git me back for the beans...
...gimme some help...
That's right, we'll take a nap.  We'll get you to Washington, we'll get you Back to your Buddies, and...
Lemme talk to him.  Will?  Shoe?
Oh really.
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
...if I had your looks, better.
Yeah, but he didn't see me.
I agree. Go thou and sin no more.
Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive, and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm.
The FAA announcement.
I told him I was in the bathroom and I'd call him right back. What the hell was I supposed to say Buddy, you got me into...
Nah, she asked the wrong question.
....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...
He never told me...
So what s on your mind kimosabe? Why am I listening to you? Got to monitor my blood pressure, so whatever you do, don't upset me.
Jackson, Steinem...
...going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal.
Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell...
Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.
Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?
Money never sleeps pal. When I came in in '69, they traded six hours a day, now the clock don't stop, London's deregulated, the Orient is hungrier than us. Just let the money circle the world, sport, buying and selling, and if you're smart it comes back paying. I just made $800,000 in Hong Kong gold. It's been wired to you -- play with it. You done good, but you gotta keep doing good. I showed you how the game works, now school's out.
What the hell do you want?
The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...
...I can't make it tonight.
Hello again, I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks.
Excuse me.
Upper West Side.
If I could have anything... this would almost do.
So, how did your conference go with Gordon?
...a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond... a Lear jet... world peace... the best of everything...
It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world.  ...right here...make love to me...now...  Stop me if I'm going too far.
Why?
How you doing Buddy?
It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.
You told him about us?
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.
Yeah, yeah, OK
Yeah 
But he still has something Mark hasn't.
She went to a waxwork party
Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.
Then why do you still like her?
Like her?  I don't know if I ever liked her.  It's just you want what you can't get.
Oh that explains everything.
You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.
This time I really don't see anyone man.
Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.
Looks a little spooky boys, you think we should do this?
Do you have a scarf?
That was very good.
Fireball?
You think you influenced her?
For the Dupont Chair.  I swear.  I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst.
At the party.
Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From next door.
You do?
Love.
Um...sure.
Yeah.
Claire.
He looked like one of the Monkees.
Stop.
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
You're discussing me with your psychic?
Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
Seance.
In the window.  Norman's at work.
Wow.  I'm losing it.
The planchette?
Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
Oh God...you knew.
Jody he was lying.
Tired?
And we moved out here for the quiet.
Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can--
...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
Claire...
Nothing's going to happen.  Besides, I have to work tonight.  The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  This is...
Unless you need me to come home...
I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe.
Well, that's nice.
"...of Perpetual Distances."  Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  "I'm afraid you've mistaken me,"  I say...
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
Oh.
...like it never even happened...
I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some "symptom" of something...
This is the Feur thing?
Who did?
What are you...?  No.
You were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving...
It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
It's Madison Fra--
I think she's starting to suspect something.
Who?
THAT'S NOT TRUE!  You wanted to quit!  And then when you did, you hated me for it... so you gave it all to her.
...would do anything just to be around me.  And I slipped.  God help me, I slipped.
It's alright.
How can you be sure?
The leaves...
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
You don't have to do that.
:No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true.
I have seen him again.  Last night.
There are two.
How do you know about Rowan ...?  I didn't --- Cemetery...?
There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  what defines you in the landscape, Michael...?  what anchors your life...? Your work...?  Your creativity...?
on't know what else to do.  Maybe I just don't belong in her life.  well - I'm already out of her life.
I'll probably be back in a week...but I can't spend Christmas in that house.   you'll check on her - every day...?
In certain cases, hell is the operative word.
I beg your par---
My...mother...?
It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great -
She was alive all these years... You NEVER let me know her. Who gave you that right...?!
A Mayfair it ever I saw one.
What is it...?
She didn't feel them
Antha...your grandmother...her life ended there, on the stones. Head split open like a melon.
You - are - a - murderer.
The wasps were meant for Michael - but there's only so much you can control, isn't there?  The great and powerful lasher - undone by a faulty ladder-..  Why would you hurt him...?!  Answer me.
If I could feel like you feel...but I have only others' feelings - . . like breeres that blow through me.  Things to be felt, yes --- but not nine to feel...
--- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.
The portraits, Lasher.  Why are the witches always before a door...? Tell me, Lasher.  Now!
Rowan...
They like you ------- kids.
My jury's still out on that,
Harder...
What else did you see- Michael...?
you touched him --- and saw him...? What was he doinging.  Kinky...?
Far from it, Michael... Don't put me up there.
Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
Seems more like a year than a month.
That's GREAT!
Wanna snack...?
Hey - you're bleeding.
Gee - look at that.  I didn't know alligators came this far up on shore
Fall in New Orleans...  This whole town is waterlogged!  The matches, the wood, my clothes, my skin.
Michael - what made you fall in love with me...?
Go home, Stu  I'll call you.
I'm getting --- left behind.
I've got a tenant coming over later - can I take the afternoon off?
I thought someone was following me - I - er -  I just needed my computer and some things...Listen, I'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that OK?
Sounds good - thank you
Yes, I'm sure you could - but I can't risk you loosing your job
Hello MRS STECKLER - we haven't seen you for a long time
I'm sorry?
My names isn't ANGELA...
No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't
No she didn't...
Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?
What's wrong?
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
We've got nothing to talk about
Surgery? Are you a doctor?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to shout...
Good - I've got to dash -  Say that I said hello to ELLEN for me would you...
See? Did you see that?
...A bouncer? Are you serious?
Cut it out, before you break something!
Don't you know anything about limo etiquette? Everything in here is included for our pleasure.
Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.
I can't believe that's your mother. We're talking babe-a-licious chub fest, right here in the 501's.
This is like my every wet dream come true.  I don't even care that you're here, too, bro.
I get it now. You and me. We're dead.
Dead?
Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.
Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.
Don't be such a pansy. All of this is YOURS.
A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen.
Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em!
These are real, live women?
What gives, Don Corleone?
Yeah?
And I was wondering.
I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.
I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple's class in 2nd grade. Blue gingham dress. Blond ponytail.
Which you pulled, hard!
Finally, some gratitude.
The one with the horses.
Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?
I always knew there was more. I felt it.
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
You mean they knew who I was?
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
I miss them, too.
I have absolutely no intention--
What do you want from me? I'm trying to be fair. But I can't keep you on staff if you turn every PTA meeting into an Agent Orange cover up.
Me?
I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.
My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.
And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
It's incredibly simple.
And then what?
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
Tell me more.
I have to be honest with you, Ted. I really despise "The Girls of Xenia."
Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.
Like what?
Thanks, Principal Merkin.
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you.
Come on, it's our only senior prom.
I'm warning you.
You kicked us off your turf, Merk. Don't rain on our parade.
What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
You ready for your big coming out party? Everybody's dying to meet you.
Me? The King of Coitus?
The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
You were the new and improved you.
You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.
I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost.
Kelly Van Ryan...
I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
About Suzie?
Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
She still work there?
No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.
I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
No.
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
Same as him.  They saw her come.  They saw her go.  They saw him follow.
You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die.
If you want company...
He did say something.
She bit you?
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
You know, I want to thank you for getting me into this class...  No way was my old man going to spring for the fees...
Is that Sam Lombardo?
I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.
So, where you off to now?
Yeah, he got her busted for possession...
There's nothing for them to get.
I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo.
Will they?
Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?
In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.
Yeah, well, you fixed that.  What the hell happened, anyway?
Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
That how you planned it?  You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...
How much is about six and a half million divided by three?
Are you mad at me?
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
Didn't you see her this morning?
J. S. Bach.
Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are.  So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?
That's a lot of butler.
You might have mentioned you had that.
They're so precious when they're asleep.
Can you fill me in here?
Know what this is?
What is that?
When we find him, he is mine.
My God!  He's so excessive!
All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling.
I could get used to this, looking down on people.
You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
You tell me.
You've... done... this... before.
Doyle's the name, sir.  Of the Connemara Doyles.  And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself.  That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way!  Your friend's already aboard.
Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that.
Now it's a bomb.
I beg your pardon?
Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
They look like acorns.
Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow.
You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.
Why not?
Gawd...you're...beautiful...
Why did you say that?
He's no magician.
Then you get us out of here.
We're a tiny version of all that?
Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
You all right?
Smells like a battle.
What's that?  I hear something!
Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?
Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why?  Nobody cares...  Except me.  You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own.
Time to change her diaper.
I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king!
She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
Watch it!
Kill him!
Willow.  To learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone!
Till it's in a powder.  The energy exits within you...
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
Ouch!!
We gotta follow them.
We are emissaries of her majesty, Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of Coshairm.
Queen Cherlindrea?
Hey, careful there!
I've seen pictures.
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
Nail it!
No pistol. Ever.
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.
Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
Oh? Anything else?
Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make coffee and breakfast.
But why?
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
I should tell you these do not have buttons.  See? Hooks and eyes.
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
Where's the nearest telephone?
You should not bother with that birdhouse.  If you're leaving tomorrow.
Good morning.
No...
I have done nothing against the ordnung.
I am not a child.
Never seen anything like that in all my years.
What about Carter?
Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity. What do you figure they plug all their shit into?
You might have killed him!
They are English. They don't understand.
-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --
Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!
If she?
... -- Oz -- has spoken!
Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so.  I'm a humbug!
Oh!
Hickory!
Are you all right, Dorothy?
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
Toto's my dog.
The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.
You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
Oh -- 
Now you're seeing reason.
Where do you want to be oiled first?
...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.
Oh! Something bit me, too!
It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --
Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
Ho -- ho --ho -- ho
As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!
I have so got brains.
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
Whhhooops!  Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again!
Oh -- does it hurt you?
Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
Comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.
Who at?
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
That's right.
Here -- here. Go 'way and let us alone!
Dorothy!
Not even a rhinoceros?
What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away! 
I'd be gentle as a lizard --
Come on -- come on --
Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!
Yes.
Did you hear that?  He'll announce us at once!  I've as good as got my brain!
Oh, dear, dear.
No, you don't.
Shame you had to spot I wasn’t the real thing.
What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!
Makes her look even more innocent.
I’ve scheduled a medical for you.
A word? I’m sure by now he’s engineered a hostile takeover.
I’m sorry.
I met you at my father’s funeral.
Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
I can’t stay.
How high up does this...arms dealing go?
Now...where were we?
What is this place?
Why are you like this?  Because Bond is dead?  It’s what you wanted.
Everything’s under control up here.  Are you ready?
Any word from him?
The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
Blake?  Dead?
I'm here, Laurie.
Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
Would you like me to stay?
Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
Jon -- what??
Jon --
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
His what?
I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.
I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?
Laurie --
Maybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with a grudge.  Thought you might want to spread the word.
CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.
Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
What does this mean?  What does it --
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.  And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us all look bad.
Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.
Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...
Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.
They're degenerates. There's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over.
Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.
"Anarchy" 99"?
Just about anything I want, it looks like. This is gonna be tough, though. There's no way to save this game. I gotta get it right the first time through.
My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.
Where are you going?
Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.
Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
What are you doing with the Ivans?
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
Aren't you afraid?
Yorgi and Kirill.
It's running three meters down. Twenty knots.
Hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation. Unless this ain't for going on vacation...
I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
Dude, what are you doing here?
Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
Thanks, but I'm here on business. I heard you're the G around here. I'm looking for some cars, expensive ones. A lot of them.
What's going on, my friend?
To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: "America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free..."
How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.
You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.
You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of --
For what purpose?
I'll tell you one thing though.
It's too far.
You should always work with a spotter.

What did she do to me?
If she held on any longer she could have.
Is that what you're looking for?
Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
I wouldn't really have let you die, you know.  I just needed...
It does indeed, Max.
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
Surprised?
Yes, don't worry.
Call me from New York before you leave??
Goodbye, darling.
Well... we'll see.
All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much.  You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive?
Not at all -- a great privilege, Doctor.
I prefer, by far, to be remembered for my own small contributions to science.  Now if we can proceed to your questions.
Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion?
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
Was he any good?
Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.
Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
Thanks...for all your help.

There's only one way.
MMMmmmm!  MMMmmmm!

Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.
I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
What?
Yes...yes, you have yours.
It wouldn't be fair to her.
All right if I turn out the lamp, sweetheart?
How do you know they're done?
Three minutes to go!
