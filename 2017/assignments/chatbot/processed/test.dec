Let me see what I can do.
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
You're sweet.
You always been this selfish?
What crap?
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
No
Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
Queen Harry?
You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
What do you think?
You're welcome.
You did what?
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
Perm?
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
Never
C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.
He always have that shit-eating grin?
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
You wanna go out with him?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
Dead at forty-one.
Yeah -- we'll see.
Don't make me do it, man
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
Away.
You need money to take a girl out
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
Fine, thirty.
We don't chat.
Block E?
I didn't have a choice.
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.

That's what you want, isn't it?
Funny, you're the only one
What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference...
You don't care if I die
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
My father wouldn't approve of that that
BIANCA
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
Try lookin' at it from this angle
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
Good call.
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
Acting the way we do.
Something like that
No one else knows
Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
Why can't we agree on this?
Parts of it.
Which parts?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Right.
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!
We'll all go crazy...
Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
A waste...?  Let me tell you something, Arojaz.  If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his.
I haven't given you much of a life.
I am busy inside.
To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.  A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
Call them.
Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
How did you manage it?
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
Six days ago, yes.
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
And who would you think of, for such a task?
Then why?
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Back in the Czech Republic?
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
They won't until this is over.
Somewhere else?
I'm just trying to find out who you are.
I know.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...
Who do you think, Chief?!
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
Okay.  But not water sports.
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
What was that, Korfin?
You do that, wiseguy.  Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does.
Vodka tonic.
Any I.D.?
Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?
No.
Did you tell him you did?
Describe him.
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
Why don't you explain it, Bobby.  Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole in the floor?
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
Pretty.
Stay here.
You got any better ideas?
Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we?  If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first.
Raw deal.
You wanna talk to her alone?
You know what I'm saying here.
Good - be tough to the end.  Actor who plays you will want to die like hero.
There are two bodies found at this point.
Answer it.
Promise?
Yeah.  I promise.
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
Don't be late.
Jesus Christ.
Keep them out of my way.
Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
What?  It doesn't work that way.
If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
How much money are you carrying with you?
He doesn't speak English.
Okay.
Don't speak Russian!
Don't want to film this?
Put the camera down, Oleg.
Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!
Your idea?  I thought it was my idea.
Surprise!  Surprise!
Milos.  Get my money!
A job?
It's easy to learn.
We started over, you can too.
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
Alright.  Go ahead.
New York.
Thanks.  Appreciate it.
He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
How did you start the fire this time?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Don't blow your nose!
There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU, TOO!!!
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
Really.
Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.
No.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
Sure, Dave, what's up?
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
In three days, darling, I hope.
How many days until you come home?
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
Yeah, dummy.  Money.
Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
Here's hoping, baby...
Would you guys...
No time for any of that crap any more, lady... I'll rip your lungs out if you don't answer fast.
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
Sure, anything you want.
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?
You sure that's the reason?
Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
I'll keep it in mind.
Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
Who gives a fuck what you think?
I don't know.
I guess he got the message...
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
I wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so I won't care for you... I wish you'd give me a little more of a chance.
Call me later.
You sure you want me to?
Jack?  What was that?
We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
That's what I always say.
What do you want?
Naw, right here's okay.
Don't mess with me. How much?
Napoleon... small.
The case was stolen?
You know exactly where they are!
No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!
...So Cornelius was telling the truth!
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
Vito Cornelius?
Hi Ma...
Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
To save the world.
I've had enough good news for today
What is it?
...Hoppi-hoppa.
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
Protect life... Until death.
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
I love you...
Gentlemen?
To fame.. salud..
I'm not accusing you...
We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
I just talked to her.
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
What can I do for you today?
What are you... ?
You betrayed us.
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...
You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
Show me.
Where do you think you're taking this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world?  How you gonna do that... ?
Where?  Show me where.
Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.
Good question.
It's their Presidential Suite.
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
I'll do whatever I can to help.
He succeeded.
You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
You don't have any other choice.
No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
You've found missing persons before.
Do you think the film could have cost that much?
Okay.
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
Neil... Neil Cole.
Well, I'm following up on your daughter, Mary, height; five four, weight; hundred ten pounds, brown eyes, blonde hair.  Born April 24, 1976.  Missing June 11th, 1992.  A runaway, that's how she's listed. Is this information correct... ?
That's exactly what I am.
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
What?
Will you let me look?
Those are her belongings.
She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?
I don't want to.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
Kristen...
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
I'm sure they're around.
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
Alright, I think I see salvation...
Nice neighborhood.
You just stay put.  You need rest.
Huh?
It's lonely in there, in my room.
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
Yeah...I guess.
There you go.  Love you.
What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
Mark!
My baby!
I don't know!
That's their problem.
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
All of us.  Right?
I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
How is he - ?
Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!
My father!  He's not - ?
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
'Us?'
Reef and I can take the Explorer down, clamp it around the eye, and ---
Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
Seems to be all around...
I...don't know!
Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
Right at our one-eyed friend!
Yes, Griff?
What direction does the system indicate?
Huh?
That's what I said!
Nothing we can do, now.
I am afraid not.  Therefore -
Of course.  But it is time to be- gin the return voyage --
All right - go to it.
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
Who?
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
No.
Same old shit.
He's a Selectman. The town. He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office. I'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car. They're town property.
No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
They said.
This way.
Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? 
Right!
In the chest.
I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
I bet you did lots of bad things.
What are you talking about?
I don't want to.
Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't mess this up anymore than it's already been messed up. Join the other kids. Do that and before you know it you'll be as happy as a goddamned clam.
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
Oh.
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
Well, right now we're not too interested. Finish up what you gotta do, then you can get bugged on your own time.
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
I won't. You interested?
You and Mel Gordon?
Mel Gordon.
Yeah.
Said what?
Okay.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
Of course! I would've heard.
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
Marg! You got orders!
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
Atta-go.
She's coming.
Love! I'm made of love!
Call it what you want.
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
Well, I never heard that one.
But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office.
For what?
Back at The Fishbowl?
I'm sorry, honey.
Your father never means to be so...
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
It was the experience of a lifetime.
Alice... I...
The world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner.
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
Stay cool.
I prefered the terrorists.
Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell.
Why? Do you enjoy it?
How can you? I mean they're people.
Jim...
You'll do it?
Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.
We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
Both of you.
You haven't even driven a car since you took office.
But this is different, sir. You're the President.
Two... THREE. GO!
Yeah, right.
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
That's my job.
Yes, sir.
You've made your point, Commissioner. There's only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that's Clarence Oveur.  He's got a lunar flight today.  I want him pulled.  Jacobs, pull Oveur!
I was reading too.
I was asking McCrosky, Commissioner.
Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
You better check it, Unger.
You better take this.
Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
I'd use the word insane.
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
Not now, Elaine.
I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.
What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?
Yes -- last week that pile of mud was only this high.
I guess this is a first for you.
Roger.
He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?
Yes, sir.
I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
Request; life support systems check.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
Can I hold him?
Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his back, Jimmy?
A b...
Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.
Yes.
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
I'm doing everything I can! -- And stop calling me Shirley!
Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
But if you'll just give me...
That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past!
Headquarters!? What is it?
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
Oh, I'd love to.
Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
No, why don't you take care ot it?
Todd?  Todd doesn't know either.
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
Yes...
He didn't recognize me.
What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
That is exactly so.  It is like your name... Sykes.  I'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that it sounds like "ss'ai k'ss", two words in my language which mean "excrement" and "cranium".
Nice signal, dickwad!
Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
Nothing?
How the hell do you know that?
Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...
Screw me?  That can't be right.
Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not sure I'm gonna go.  She doesn't need her burn-out of a father there...
No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
You humans are very curious to us. You invite us to live among you, in an atmosphere of equality we've never known before.  You lay before us a beautiful green world, full of freedoms and opportunities... You give us ownership of our lives for the first time... and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves: to live by the rules... rules that aren't made to keep one people subordinate to another, but rules that exist to preserve equality.  You aspire to very high ideals here.
Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
... and Porter ran a piece of shit mom-and-pop mini-mart.  So what the hell's the connection?
No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
We?  You've taken it?
Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?
What's that?
Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
Shit, if Kristin had to get married where I could afford it, we'd be holding the reception at Buddy's Burgers.
Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!
Yes.  That follows.
Well, thanks, I --
You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.
We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
Forget it.
Yes, Hicks?
What's the question?
Let's waste him.  No offense.
We didn't miss anything.
Stand back.
What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end.  Why can't we use that?
Seal the door.
And hope to die?
Why do they tell little kids that?
I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.
Indeed.
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
A brothel.
Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste.
You were sublime.
No, she's fine.
I'm so relieved.
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
I've come to dinnnnnner!
Yes!
What are you talking about?
Why not?
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
Yes.
Oh yes? You always know everything.
How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
This isn't pride. It's sheer stupidity!
Tell them to go!
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
Stanzi!
It's killing me.
How charming.  But why did he not come himself?
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
Then he didn't send you?
Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!
Originals?
What for?
What?
He's not going to work on this anymore. It is making him ill. Please.
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
Hey!
Gertrude!
Cattivo again, Court Composer. Well, tell him, Mozart. Name us a German virtue.
You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
Sire.
Yes?
Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
Would you tell me why?
Is she not here?
I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!
Oh, let's not talk about it.
It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
Yes, thank you, sir.
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.
That kind of music should be punishable by death.
I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
Animals?
Yes.
Madame.
Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?
Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.  How long have you been playing, Fraulein?
No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.
So you are. How is your pretty wife?
She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?
But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.
Thank you! Oh, thank you.
Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
No, no. I have to get back. I have -
I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.
What?
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
Would you? Actually, you could.
But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
Consigned to flames of woe.
Do you believe in it?
Oh, yes.
Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
Mozart -
Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
Baron!
Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
About what?
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
My son, no one can speak for God.
What difference does that make?
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
He's setting that play to music?
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
Of course now. Right away, before I get any older.
Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
But he's all right?
Yes, Doctor.
No, why?
I dream of death mostly.
That's not really a very proper question.
That's easy enough.
Good. I thought for a moment I was the only embarrassed one in the room.
A werewolf?
Charming.
Bathroom.
David, perhaps you'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower.
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
That's good, Alex.  Reassure me.
Do me an enormous favor?
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
The zoo?
I said goodbye to you. I was locked out of the flat. I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window. I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo!  I guess I am out of my fucking mind.
No.
No.
You did, did you?
Why are you doing this to me?
No, but we're about to.
An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
Did you see Jack?
Right.
She says she 'likes me too much'.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
That's a wolf's head.
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
Okay.
Shall we?
Well, not quite a blood-thirsty mob.
What was it?
Come on, where?
It's circling us.
I'll tell you when we get there.
Thanks a lot.
Life mocks me even in death.
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
It's cold, David, and I'm so alone. The undead surround me. Have you ever talked to a corpse? It's boring! I'm lonely! Kill yourself, David, before you kill others.
Jack, are you really dead?
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
What about the zoo?
I want you to meet some people.
Gerald is the man you murdered in the subway. We thought it best you didn't see him as he's a fresh kill and still pretty messy.
Why don't we ask him?
Sorry, love.
No.
I'd like some tea, please.
You here again? What do you want?
I want to know why .
Yes - sure—
Yeah.
Where do you think I've been?  I took the baby for a stroll in the park.
I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
Oh, you would, eh?  All right. If it's more important than golf, go ahead. What's on your mind?
Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. Those are his exact words, gentlemen. Character!  It's the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums.
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
We've been waiting fifteen minutes—
You know what you can do with that! Come on, take a look at this! You'll see a demonstration of faith that's worth more than all the collateral in the world.
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
It's one of the boys from headquarters. He always sings "Mother Machree" whenever he's got good news. Looks like this case'll be settled in no time.
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.
I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
That don't do us any good.
But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
Now let me see, what comes next?  Oh yes, I know - what are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
Why are you so anxious?
No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.
Good for you. Come on.
Thank you!
Of course, let them in! You're late now.
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn—
In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . .
Why - well, I—
Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon.
All right. Send him in.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Got my letter?
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Well . . . uh . . . I . . .
No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.
Please, lady. Please be quiet. Everything will be all right.  Open up here, folks. All right, folks, please!
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
Oh, ten dollars—
Oh, Matt.
Well . . . ?
It couldn't have been earlier?
wasn't anywhere near this place—
Bought himself a pocketbook!
Sometimes a wound will kill.
Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!
That was two hours ago.
I say we ride into town and kill us some Pinkertons and railroad men.
Say we bust into a bank. We yell "We're the Younger-James Gang!" People are gonna be thinking, "The younger James Gang? Is there an older James Gang? How come we never heard of the older James gang?" So people are trying to figure that out instead of raising their arms.
As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
Swear on Jimmy's grave.
Oh no...
Two.
Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.
How?
Yeah.
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
Pass me some whisky.
I'm thinking...
Both would be nice.
-- Exactly. Because this is a war.
What?
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
My little Web did that?
Pff. He jumped his horse clear over our heads, killed a dozen Union soldiers before they knew what hit them.
Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
Zee, we got to talk to you and your father.
Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
Yeah, Jimmy?
I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy.
A fair number, Ma.
Say your prayers?
You were little Jesse James when you left.
What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
Let me see that.
Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
Yes?
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
I think so.
Thank you, Miss -- ?
Really?
You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.
I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
Oh, that's the best part.
Can you put men at all four?
What is that?
Stop it. I'm...
I'm thinking Dorsia.
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
Are we here?
Pull out, goddamnit!
It's a plain end, see? So?
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
Everybody has a great body now.
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
Yes, I am.
You saw the ad in the Times?
There was no ad in the Times.
No, you...didn't?
Now, if you'll excuse me.
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...
Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock?
I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a dress. A skirt or something.
Can you bring Mr...
Oh no. I have no plans.
They know me.
Interesting.
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
Hmmmm.
What do you think I do?
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it.
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.
Listen, if you could talk to them  I would really appreciate it. I'm really late. I have a lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes.
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.
Don't tell him you're here.
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
I think his family wants this kept quiet.
Shoot.
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
Nice. Very nice.
No problem. 
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
Oh really? I didn't know that.
Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
Marcus?
Yes.
Where was Marcus?
It's cold out, too, isn't it?
Al.
Yeah, well, you're late.
I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.
Another Martini, Paul?
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
You don't wanna move, do you?
Didn't you visit the campus?
He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, "Did you really do this just today?" Cause I was impressed. He said "What're you implying?"
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
Teddy was killed last night.
What're you -- what?
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
I remember.
I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself.
Milo, you --
...What?
You're just afraid to eat it.
I am. I am, sir.
Brian! You wanna be a big deal, don't you? That's your dream in life.
Outpost doesn't own em.
That'd change with a criminal indictment.
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
You've been coming in early.
The answer's not in the box. It's in the band.
Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one.
'Sorry about the late notice...
You see what's hanging on the wall?
'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12.
In exchange for endowments. They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em.
Cool.
Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to --
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
You're compulsive.
She saved my life.
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
Before they kill somebody else, too.
Thank God.
Why?!
At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.
Well, he micro-managed the company till it got too big...  'Guess he needs to micro-manage something.
Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her.
There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
You're not listening.
Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
Care for some saki?
Kiss me.
Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms.  Kensington is her daughter.
Yes?
Be careful.
Thank you, Exposition.
Oh, and Austin...
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
You must admit, she is rather mannish. No offense, but if that's a woman, it looks like she's been beaten with an ugly stick.
Not quite, actually. Vanessa, I have something for you.
No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.
I'm sorry?
Do you want to talk to him?
Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
No, did you use a condom?
Not in the Nineties.
I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.
Indeed.
Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs.
That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
Kiss me.
Danger's my middle name.
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
Yes.  Scott!
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin.
Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
Show me.
People have to tell me these things. I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here.  OK, no problem. Here's my second plan. Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a "laser."  Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth, which we scientists call the "Ozone Layer." Slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer. That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom.
I just don't see it.
And how do you feel about that?
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
Promised? Who promised?
Impossible?
He tried to warn us ...
Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
To you ... ?
Too many cooks --
Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.
And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
Really?  I fail to see the connection.
Yes indeed. I need protection.
For a man in my position --
After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?
The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
I might say the same.
Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
Is that written in his shoe?
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ...
Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
Barely.
You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you?
Always.  Except ...
It wasn't me; you have my word.
Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.
I'm a wanted woman, I know ...
It's called Black Leather.
Have you any place in mind?
It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated.  Wait here.
Well, I can't possibly go like this.
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
Guilty until proven innocent?
I feel sure of it.
That's not playing by the rules.
If you say so.
Debbie's marrying Rick.
Great. I'll go with you. Wait a second. Hey, Raul! Move that car, will you?
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
I'm ready to make you another deal.
The best.
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
Yes, sir, I am.
If it were me, I'd reason with him first. Then, if that failed...  ...I'd take more persuasive action.
Keep me informed.
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
You're so romantic...
Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
Great, Mom.
You know your father enjoys his company.
Ilene, we don't really know that.
Any time, Al.
Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
No, have fun first. Then laugh. Now, forget about marriage for a while. Go party.
Can't I just maim it a little?
Mr. Thomerson, I...
I'm not really hungry.
I'm proud of you, lad.
Who's your friend?
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy. It'll just steam on us. It won't flash. Go high in the ceiling.
Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking job!
Sheep don't count.
I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that I don't think is going to make it.
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
-- C'mon, Stephen.
-- You split the team, man. And what was that crap with the standpipe? You'd think you and a hose were never introduced before.
Hey.
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
So hello.
Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
Saw what?
How do you know?
-- What were they doing there?
What are we going to do about this?
I'll handle it.
You're back.
I seem to remember some pretty good nights on JP II.
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
I don't know anything about it.
I quit two days ago, Brian.
I'll see ya around, huh?
It's a small town.
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
Sure you do.
What?
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
Look, I knew your father, he had a helluva reputation on this job. But that don't mean you get any slack. Swayzak sends you down here, okay, I gotta eat you, that's the rules and I got nothing to say about that. But Swayzak or no, you live with me. Step out of line, and I don't care who knows you, I'll swing the hammer.  You think you're the first?
Are you going public with this?
Fire.
Nice bunch of guys.
It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?
No.
Just wondering.
I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...
Coffee sucked.
Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?
I'll be there.
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
McCaffrey, hold this for us.
Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
He works for me.
I know you.
You don't know... nobody knows...
Investigator Rimgale.
That Jesus Christ was the Son of God and he came to die for your sins.
OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God?
Nah...
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
I forgive you.
Please. Please don't forgive me. I've always hated you for that.
Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.
Let me think about it.
Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
Yesterday morning, God gave me but one chance to use something else to serve Him. Not my arms or my legs, but something I used for the first time, for the last time, and will never use again. My vagina.
How 'bout...
YEAH!
Well you did.
So now I see where you're coming from.  Just because we ain't rapping about Gucci, Timberland, Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo.
Delacroix.
What do you do?
So that's what you been doing?
De-la-croix.
Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
And I'm the feet.
Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.
DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
To what?
I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
I wasn't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as I got off the elevator.
Go on.  Good so far.
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
What are you talkin' 'bout?  It's the move.  Stay wid me now.  We're movin' fast.  What does everybody else think about this?
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
All I know is what happened to me. All that other mess I just file into the "life's too short" category.
In life?  I'ma keep on living, having a good drink, got me a good young woman, make a couple of dollars and make people laugh. Haven't I always tol' you all nigga's are entertainers?  The question is what are you gonna do, Peerless?
It wasn't my fault.  If I would have known, I would have known.
This is Cheeba.
Everybody shut up.
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
Hi, Mona.
I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
Oh, is that what I'm doing?
And now is definitely not the time to bitch up.
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
He said that?
I can't go all the way down south.
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money.  Like my man Mase says, "it's all about the Benjamins."
Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
The one with da big...
Around...
...too late, maybe around...
...like macaroni and cheese...
Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.
That's ancient history.  That has nothing to do with you and I.
I know I won't be your puppet.
You know the use of arms very well, Best, and no one can doubt your courage; but Michael and I will see you home for all that.
It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
I never was more in earnest.
This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.
Only a very little, as soldiers do.
I'll match any man with the sword.
A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize.
I have heard of them.
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
Your honor must lower his voice.
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
We will practice in the mornings, my boy, and I'll put you up to a thing or two worth knowing.
But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?
Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.
On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
Not even that.
Have you not a man whom you value?
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.
Agreed.
Then you must get it.
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.
As much as possible.
As much as possible?
Yes!
Well, Mr. Cosgrove, I'll answer you point by point.  The King is exceedingly averse to make peers, as you know.  Your claim, as you call them, have been laid before him, and His Majesty's gracious reply was, that you were the most impudent man in his dominions, and merited a halter, rather than a coronet.  As for withdrawing your support from us, you are perfectly welcome to carry yourself whithersoever you please.  And, now, as I have a great deal of occupation, perhaps you will do me the favor to retire, or tell me if there is anything else in the world in which I can oblige you.
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.
May I be quite frank with you?
When I asked them in what form they would accept her ladyship's assurances, they said that they were only prepared to accept them if her ladyship confirms her written consent by word of mouth, in their presence, at their counting-house in Birchin Lane, London.  I requested they come here, and save her ladyship and yourself the inconvenience of the trip to London, but they declined, saying that they did not wish to incur the risk of a visit to Castle Hackton to negotiate, as they were aware of how other respectable parties, such as Messrs. Sharp and Salomon had been treated here.
Is he all right, papa?
Yes, he's fine.
Sir, let those laugh that win.
I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?
None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?
HEY!
We don't know. West is dead.
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
Epilepsy.
Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --
Yeah.
Would you have believed me?
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
Why?
Yeah...
Who you gonna trust, Ray? Him or your friend?
Why?
This is a lot of information to be getting... I have to think --
We wait and I'm a dead man. I got a black face, a criminal record, and over a hundred other cadets who'll testify how much I hated West -- my court martial will take six minutes. It's either me or them, Ray, and you gotta decide right now.
What happened to "degrees"?
Can I go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot?
Well?
And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?
Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me.
Someone must have got a shot off. He wasn't exactly a moving target.
JAG gets here in three hours. Try for the confession.
That's horseshit and you know it.
You're crazy --
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
He's in interrogation?
Is Dunbar cute?
Is he handsome, self assured, carry himself well, does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor, does he have good bones, suggesting good breeding, does he slouch or sit up straight -- these are important questions, as they reveal a great deal about this man's character so please get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me is he cute?
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good -- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop -- by admitting it I appeared trustworthy.
Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.
What?
Dunbar... He said he didn't shoot West. West wasn't shot, Kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and Dunbar never saw the body.
What happened next?
And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
That bugs you too?
No.
Hardy, for Chrissakes --
Really.
Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
Yeah and he doesn't know when --
So you took off your shirt?
He whispered it in my ear.
He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...
Where's your shirt, Mueller?
It's too neat.
Sir, yes, sir!
Edward Bloom.
Not yet.
The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.
It truly is.
I brought it.
Thirty years. Maybe more.
Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?
You're pretty good at arithmetic.
And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And that's not much difference at all.
Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
What were you dreaming about?
I never knew.
Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.
I can.
Karl.
I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  So what do you say? Join me?
I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
You owe me three-fifty.
Son?
Can we talk?
Dad!
What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?
You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.
There's a lot of expectation. I don't want to disappoint my fans.
Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it.
You don't have to.
But it's romantic.
Mmm, what?
He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
Uh... Yes.
What?
Oh.  We are Russian.
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
Yes it's okay. Thank you for the food.
No, no...
Oh nothing.
Tell me.
Do you believe in love?
It's very strange. How many people are truly themselves with their love? It is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers. There are no Marches Against Heartache, no Ministries Against Loneliness, no Concerts Against Disappointment. We look away. And still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us. The one thing we all share but don't say. Look John I will show you something.
What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
Oh Jesus. Of course I can't.
Right. Okay. Good.
I mean... "Ants." "I've got a problem with ants."
It's makes it easier. Okay.
I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
Well as it turns out I did.
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
I said I don't have any.
If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
Why not?
I don't hate you.
Listen. I didn't go rooting around in your private stuff.
Sometimes which?
You...
So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
Well what have you got?
No.
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
Maybe you will find out.
Oh, she older than that.
That'd be nice.
What do you need?
Can I come in?
Well, that makes it easier.
Yeah.
I just been so mixed up lately, Gill. And, you know, with her history, I can see how she could get scared...  ...and run.
Stop what?
If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's...
Or what? OR WHAT?
Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
Tehronne? Tehronne done this?
Two days?
Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off...
No ma'am.
In my house, you watch that lip...
Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!
I CAN'T!
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.
Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
To freedom.
You can handle it.
Don't think that'd be wise.
I know that.
Get a good picture in your mind.
Huh?
This Rae... you get with her?
Like I say, you wanna hook that up... I ain't in ya way. That switch of hers been all over this town. Got that sickness, you know.
What'chu sayin'?
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
Naw!
Go ask him.
You sayin' that gun's for me if I don't?
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
Y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.
Not like that.
I just know how you get. Good to know, them butterflies still in ya gut.
We ain't here to talk about that shit.
That's right.
Rae!
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
Yeah?
Did 'ya have fun with her? Sweet as a peach, I bet. Huh? Huh?
Yeah.
Eh, if the bootie fits...
Home.
Get rid of it.
Why?
It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
I'll get rid of it when you get rid of the egg-beater.
What?
The Wolf?
Beats forty hours on a plane.
Hey, come on, big guy like you, cop from New York.  You're gonna be the biggest thing to hit town since Godzilla.
Go to sleep, Charlie.
First decent idea you've had.
He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
What does Charlie mean?
If you give me one.
What's the problem here?
Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.
Nick --
A resort city, Beppu.
I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.  I like him waiting.
I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
I don't know.
A wife.  She left.
Luck.
You have a helluva way of answering.
He's on duty.
I need someone to translate for me.
It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
And I'm supposed to care?
What do you chant?
Who am I supposed to be?
Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
Yeah.
Thought you knew your way around dark alleys, detective.
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
He was my partner.
I planned on catching him, Captain.
It is not allowed.
Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.
If he won't cooperate?
Then go get him.
That wouldn't be very sporting.
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
And what can he do for you?
Can the maker repair what he makes?
Had in mind something a little more radical.
But not to last.
Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.
You could help us.
His company made us.
No, you stay here with us.  Out last night together.
He's not ready yet.
What was he after?
But I would like to buy you drink.
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
Prosit.
I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
You sure?
Never been more sure of anything in my life.
What night?
What's suck night?
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
You talking about the Opera House on the Main?
You mean the snake.
Why should I be?
I've already got more help than I need.
If they are smart, they take naps.
That's another thing I can't do.
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
What?
Black?
No.
But in your profession that is a risk.
Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a machine can be a hazard.  The Voight-Kampff scale is a machine, isn't it?
What desert?
We sure did.
Just better.
Thanks.
As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.
Good.
Yes?
You like it?
Adam, I'd like to introduce you to my associate -- Mr. Brown.
For how long?
I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
Here, pick these up!
Why doesn't that surprise me?
I don't know. Why doesn't it?
Get away from me!!
It's Perry!
Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!
Take it. damn it!
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
Sorry.
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
This is for me.
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
You said it would be easy!
Um-hum.
Uh...yeah.
No it's not!
But, Eve, I would--
And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you out--because I quit!  This is ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm ridiculous!
I know...and I'm really sorry.
Of course.  I shouldn't be over here at this hour.
It was at least as good as the sky.
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
A card?
Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
Tempus fugit!
No. Sit down.
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
Yes, father?! Yes?
I'll try.
Uh, I think they have.
You nut!
Almost all of them.
What?
And thanks for always being happy!
Of what?
I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
Yes.
And now you must let me be the judge of that!
Good god.
The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
I never know anymore.
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
The locks.
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
Hi.
Coming!
Would you excuse me?
I don't believe it!
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
We stay down here.
I knew you'd like him.
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us.
Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
We did not leave together.
Yes, you do.
You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
You're goddamn right I am!
What?!
To get some frozen poultry.
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
Buy it from me?
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
You did? A human ear?
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
No, not at all.
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Oh my God. Is her son OK?
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
Sure I do.
I'm doing it.
No police!!!  No police!!
I asked first.
You called me Jeffrey.
Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
You look beautiful to me.
No.  Hi baby.
Mommy's here.
Frank?
Then, shut up!
If you want to.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Yeah.
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Uh-uh.
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
You've got a point there.
Yeah, if it opens the door.
Yeah.
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.
I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
You saw a lot in one night.
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
Yes.
Yeah?
I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.
I'm really sorry.
What am I going to do?
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
Jeffrey!!
No.
Just some fatherly advice.
NO.
Just a minute.
Yes.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.
Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.
Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.
Yes mother.
Any word back from the E.R.s?
This is a six-shooter.
Certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.
Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it. I've been working for those fat bastards since I was in high school and look at this place.
What?
No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?
Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
Ma, what's wrong?
So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?
Fuck!
Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma.
"I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan."
I don't know they just always need it.
Holy shit. Who? How many?
He's a good man.
We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
Detective Greenly. Who the fuck are you?
Chief, what the fuck is this?
Eight.
Those cocksuckers sold me out!
You feel?
Yeah. And uh, he's pissed off. He says, "Why you crackers always gotta find my mother fuckin' pot? And he tells him he's gonna grant all his three wishes but he's gonna give all the black guys...
No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones.
No. This is he.
Yeah, I heard that.
Just turn right here.
There's another stocker, right?
Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.
Like he meant it.
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
Anthony, we're on the run. This is an emergency. It's only fair that...
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.
No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
Well, the world is a little bit colder today.
What?
She doesn't need to know.
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
That's what she is!
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
Ah. Couple days ago.
Eleven fifteen.
I don't want to be too much of a liability.
So do I.
You're all clear.
Check the fucking elevator. It's moving.
Applejack! What's happening?
Careful. Check his pulse.
Come on, Kumar.
Behind Bob's house.
What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
No, that door over there.
Death.
You could make your own cinnamon toast.
OK, Dad.
Yes. You just got to stick with it.
I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
Jesus Christ! No.
Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.
God. That does sound corny. Oh, your skin feels so soft and silky. But it really kind of does.
The front stairs.
True.
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
What are you talking about, Bob?
Can you use a coaster.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
Maybe she turned.
Hang on. This is important, Bob. Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation. The money and the people. You're responsible for the external situation. The streets and the getaway.
That's my responsibility.
I told you they were there.
He wouldn't move.
Not in that car you're not.
Come on in. What you been up to?
I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to --
He's having a heart attack or something.
This is no good.
Oh, yeah.
Yes.
No, if I go out on this job, then it's just another score by Mr. Henry. And I don't see it like that. This is your job. Your creation. I want you to try this.
Come on in!
Good to know you, John.
She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...
What do you mean?
What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
May I finish?
Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive?
It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
No... It must have been Bourne.
Thanks.
There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
It was staged?
Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
Okay.
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
No. It's because you don't know how they died.
You're a liar.
Is this really happening?
-- my coat -- but we should --
-- what? --
-- it hasn't been two years --
He was at the campground yesterday.
So...
Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
What?
I did.
Yes.
You hear me? I believed you.
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
My first job.
That's where we came out.
You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.
It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.
Felt promising. It's a start.
Didn't want your father to die either, did ya? But it happened.
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
So let the council swear publicly.
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace.
What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this.
All so very boring! He wants me to learn to fight too, so let me do it!
I rest.
Your rest is making me exhausted.
Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
No. One of us is enough.
How many?
He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.
Thank you for accepting.
Thank you for inviting.
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
I will be with you, like this. Forever.
I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.
But now that I am here, will you speak with a woman?
Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met.
Who would do such a thing?
Exactly.
I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions.
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
Can't he come out for one day?
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
I don't know. These things take time.
Fine. You'll get them, Evan. But I think it's far more important to focus on your case right now.
Fix?
Shit. I knew you were crazy.
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
So you believe me?
Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?
Photos?
That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart.
Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
What do you want to know, Evan?
No, but I think something really bad might've happened to us.
Those are your clothes, silly.
Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.
Because you're... different.
I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
It's crossed my mind from time to time.
Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
Gee, thanks friend.
Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff.
He is? Well, Captain Renault's getting broadminded. Sit down. Will you have a drink?
At the roulette table, trying to win enough for our exit visa. Well of course, he's losing.
Yes, I'll bet.
Yes, Monsieur.
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca has problems. Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.
Yes, Monsieur.
Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
Suppose we do.
-- We might as well be frank, Monsieur. It will take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca. And the Germans have outlawed miracles.
Good day.
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know...
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
For the last time, put them on the table.
No, not yet.
Everything is quite all right.
No, Victor, no.
But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
He came from Paris with Rick.
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met --
Your work.
Good evening. You see, here we are again.
Thank you.
Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.
But we made a deal.
Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.
Yes.
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
We'll be there.
May we proceed with the business?
Thank you.
I believe you have a message for him?
Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
Realizing the importance of the case, my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects.
Champagne and a tin of caviar.
How do you do, Mr. Rick?
But everybody's having such a good time.
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
Perhaps not.
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
Serves me right for not being musical.
-- Sacha, call a cab.
-- You thought what?
If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
Boss, let's get out of here.
Water water water --
Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.
You quitter you quitter you quitter.
The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
Must be a story there.
I can't even keep fish alive.
It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
Yes there is.
No, this is Jack.  Jango was hit by a UPS truck.  Can you believe it?
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
Not when you have no choice.
And how was your Christmas?
There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour, goes through Sydney.
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
Doctor Hegel tells me he discussed the Vietnam POW syndrome with you.
Well, when that IV runs out, you're through with us.  Just the dentist tomorrow.
Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.
It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.
This is my home.  I'm part of the wallpaper.
What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
That's why I'm running foreign and you're not.  That's why you're not married and I am.
I'm most definitely not dead.  And as I recall, you're the sick fucker.
You should have smelled me.
I never thought it would end.  Then it did.  It was so great to be saved, I couldn't stop laughing.
That's all there is.
Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...
Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
Some new *things* would be useful. I don't need any "new help."
Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. He could use some clothes.
I just hope he won't expect us to say *Grace* all the time.
Sometimes I want to meet them so I can kill them. Just sometimes.
I doubt it. She's just an...
Good night, Daddy.
Burma!
Okay...
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
"King Kong". It's really good.
Oh, sure!
Well, she was in a weakened condition...  I don't know! What about "King Kong"?! Is that medically possible?
Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges.
I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.
Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
If you're trying to be funny, Homer...
Please don't...
Well, this *is* an orphanage.
You mean somebody asked?
How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
No. She was an immigrant.
I don't remember.
*And* over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump.
Migrants?
The trees are flak--antiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground.
Is it true?
Okay. Then you can be of use.
I haven't read that.
I don't think so.
It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!
Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
I don't need your gratitude.
Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.
I don't know.  Just promise me one thing.
It's just my heart.
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
Now, now. He's a good boy.
What business is you in, Jack? Just tell me what your business is...
They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
Tough day?
Well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery.
You're welcome. I was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us.
Ten percent. Of how much?
The Anti-Christ?
Gee... What makes you say that?
Just the last three weeks.
That's not a bad place to start.
After you cut her loose.
Fine. But only if we recover the cash.
It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake...
So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with?
So what? We just stay clear of him.
Jake, I mean, come on --
I just don't know if this says, "me". What's the fabric?
I have a good crew.
You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.
Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
No, you listen. We're partners now and even though I'm running the show for you, I'm still running the show. That means I get a little respect. So I don't want to hear anymore of this Scooter, Buddy, Junior, Skippy, Tiger, bullshit. It's Jake.  And I gotta tell you, for a guy who spends all his time in a gym, you could be in better shape.
Ring it for him, Sobo.
Great. Thank you.
Oooh. Sassy. What do you care who feels me up, Jake? Unless it kinda gotcha going. Did it, Jake? Getcha going?
Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something.
Glenn talked you out of it.
Sort of. I was telling him about this great love of my life who's name I don't remember, and I could see... He was getting pissed. I thought it was just because he was worried about me, but... He told me that I was stupid because my boyfriend didn't really love me.
You know why I told you that, Jake?  Because I trust you too.
What about what?
No, I want my cut!
Then shut up.
But the best part was that he couldn't find Gordo! He was in the bathroom. So he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling! And there's Gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a PC World Magazine!
Do you have a ticket?
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched!
Pretty much.
I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
So what do you want?
We got a good thing going here. You want to blow it over an overbite?
We're here.
What do you get out of it?
Literally. It's not a bad deal, gentleman. I get peace of mind. You get Detective Sheilds. But this is the best part, Walter... Walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile. Capice?
To who?
Whoa, whoa... There he is.
It's just insurance.
Put your hand down. I don't high five.
Why did you quit?
I can imagine.
Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa?
Looking forward!
Good God, no. But with skill like that, what do you want a job for? You don't need to work.
How's that football story corning along?
Turn around.
I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.
Take it back. Till you sell your book.
What job?
I had training. In the Republic.
Fine.
Haven't you got a conscience of your own?
I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.
-- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
It's the truth.
-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?
It's none of my business what you write. And your job, that's none of my business either. I love you. And I've done everything wrong.
Not talking. Writing.
I thought you wouldn't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here.
It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
Just an accident. Nothing.
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
What kind of trouble?
Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
It won't.
Reynolds? You've done your research.
I can't do it, Jani.
Yes.
Do you?
Yes.
How are you?
You did?
Too much. Eighteen hundred.
What the fuck are you talking about?
I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
We tried. But there wasn't enough business. The punters like company.
Where's the magnet?
I make it six.
For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters.
That hair will have to go.
Right, that checks out here.
Key? Key? What is the key?
Oh, God...
Well, it is kind of a long shot...
It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
Armed.
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Fine. Think about this one, then: how do you know you exist?
Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.
All right now, here's the big question: how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
So if you detonate in...
Yes, Doolittle.
I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
Naah. All stable.
Fred.
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute.
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
I can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly...
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.
Ah... pity, pity...
Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?
We're running out of time, sir.
Bruno's girlfriend.
Or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is.
How come I never hearda you before?
What the hell are you doing?
None of your business.
You mean until you showed up?
It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense.
I'm really glad we're having this conversation.  You're right.  I was angry at you.  But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault.  Can you ever forgive me?
Like de prophets say, "Only the unrighteous husband sends expensive gift- wrapped underpants to another woman."
I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
Yech...
Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
Look, I'd really like to...
Hang on, Lauren.  We're conferencing in Sophy.
I don't want to move away.
We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
Girlfriend?
So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
So what are you gonna do about it?
Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money. It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.
Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...
She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?
You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.
What do you want?
My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
Okay, okay.
You did.
Right here someplace.
Thank you.
More money... Like I'm shocked to hear you say that.
I'll live... Regarding your case...I'm afraid I've come up with some bad news on your fiance.  Lemme get the file.
Just do it... Five-seven-five-oh- eight...
Yeah.
A little what?
How long you and me known each other?
Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.
I'll bet you can.  Sit.
She's got my word.
Okay...idea.  Compromise, right?  Bruno here comes with me.  He holds the money until mommy shows up, then we close escrow.  What you do with her after I'm gone doesn't keep me awake nights.
Feel like the dog's dinner.
What if he's on the level?
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
Max--
You left out condescending.
I'm a toy to her.
Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
--a philandering pig.
I'll give it my best shot.
Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
Easy Sketchy.
Say the words, "I understand."
How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well.
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
Hawk.
Yeah?
I don't care. I wanna hear more.
I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.
Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?
What's it worth to you?
Sunday, but...
Curly.
Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
And if it ain't cleaned off?
No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?
Hawk?
The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
Just check whatever you were wearing last night. Now!
Please, Jam, we're trying to vent some hostility here. Sure the whole thing may be your fault, but who's gonna get pissed off at you?
Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm.
Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show us.
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later.
You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome.
You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
If you truly are sorry, son, then you better pray like you've never prayed before. God willed me to find those tickets because He wanted to hear from you.  He knows you need help and He wants you to ask Him for it.
Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.
You're one to talk, Lex. Your mom's a fuckin' dyke.
Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.
Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, "Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole." We're going this time and that's all there is to it.
I can see that, bright boy. What happened to it?
Okay, I'm just a little mad now! Jam, why'd you talk us into picking that bitch up in the first place!?
All I got is five. The rest is in the Volvo.
What do you want?
You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.
The KISS Army!
Not if I shoot first!
Yeah.
That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, "Good morning!"
Now that's what I like to hear!  Because too many young men and women today are paralysed by their fears. They give in to their feelings of self-doubt... they surrender their bodies to the temptations of drugs, alcohol and premarital sex. Empty solutions. These are toxic chemicals... and disease-spreading behaviour.
Like a spear.
I'm not following you.
You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end.
Donnie! Give it back!
I can do anything I want... and so can you...
Take it off. I want to see you.
School's cancelled.
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
Infant Memory Generators.
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
Where are we going?
No. Frank.
The Lifeline is divided that way.
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.
Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.
I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
Then go find her, Donnie. Don't let her get away.  She was right about the rabbits. Go.
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
Can anyone else see him?
It reminded me of my dog Callie.
No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
I know.
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
God exists because you're horny.
Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.
Guess who wrote it?
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
I was just being honest.
Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
What I think is going on with your son.
Well, you know about his past. And when you said to look for signs of aggression... He was recently suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher.
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum.
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
No. Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him.
Loretta, never have kids.
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
"Here," wh-wh-what?
Your parents'd kill you.
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.
Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons.  Well, I sat down for a beer and KA- BLEWEY! Next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window. Next thing I know, I'm ass up in Loretta's flower bed.
Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
And the bite marks on my ears?
Yes, Leslie!
Yah-sure, fine... fine.
Okay... well, bye.
Shut it up, Loretta.
All right, they're makin' a movie.
Okay. Take her purse.
They told me to practice.
My dress'll reek.
Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.
Okay?
"U.S.A. is A-okay."
Okay, everybody, listen up!
Shut up, Hank. This here's business.
What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP!  Cut her outta this!
Suppose a pretty dame Into my castle came - And let us say that I was going strong.  She might be stuck on me, but what good would it be, if the king can do no wrong.
"My dear President"...
That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now?
"My President"...
"My"...
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
You do and I'll fire you.
Never mind then, I'll get in touch with him myself -
None of your business...  Take another letter.
Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
Yes -- why?
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
All right -
No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
Half watch dog?
I don't call him, I whistle.
Oh no, I can't do it.
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.
Well, maybe he's still the vice- president.  Now if I were to offer you --
I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
What do I get?
He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
All right -- I'll go out and find one.
The population must increase With great rapidity.  We give a couple seven years To raise a family. If, by that time, there is no branch Upon the family tree, we stand 'em up against the wall - and Pop goes the Weasel.
Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
I don't remember.
No... it was a seven letter word.
I still like UPSTART the best.
No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
These are the laws of my administration: No one's allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke -- And whistling is forbidden...
Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
You satisfied your selfish whims, while nations tottered, dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion --  Not bad, eh?
Well no -- not exactly -- but --
Oh, would you...?
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
What do you mean?
Well, these things take time.
I found it.
Did you see it?
You listen, you're not going to have much of a livelihood if this man dies. He's got the rale, he's very weak, and I don't know how much damage has been done by his "fall". Now stop wasting time and fetch a cab.
Never mind that, I want my man!
You don't own this man!
I've got my rights, damn you, and I'm going to the authorities!
Right... Right.
Indeed!
Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.
Yes sir.
Oh, is he a friend of yours?
No, more of an acquaintance.
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
And what was that, John?
I don't understand.
Tell me, John, how did you know the rest of the 23rd Psalm?
Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.
Well, yes.
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, Thou anointest my head with oil...
He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.
O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.
Yyyess.
Yes!
Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
Say "Merrick".
Righteousness for his namesake.
Thank you very much.
When one is invited to tea, one must look one's best.
It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
...Can you cure me?
There is one more thing, John. Here.
Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him...
Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.
You're right, Mothershead, please forgive me... Of course, I appreciate everything you've done for John, and I'm glad that you are concerned about his welfare. But, I'm the physician in charge and I must do what I think best. I'm also very late, so please forgive me.
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
Very smart indeed.
Who, Father?
These? What are THESE? They're swords.
Put them down!  PLEASE make them put them down.
Why?
That's right!
Of course.
Then let go!
No living man has ever set foot in the Halls of Asgaard... The Gods will never let you return.
Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
Is it summer or winter, Erik?
The sky WAS blue, Erik... once.
You've got to let me go!
Yes.
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
I don't suppose... no...
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
Louder.
I know. Snorri! Get your oar out!
It saved my father!
No.
You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed?
We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
She got me thinking...
ROW!
Why should WE care?
So?
No! Arrgh!
Who gets killed?
We'd be the first!
Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
Is THIS Hy-Brasil?
I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.
You could charge him what you like.
That's right.
Well... I... I thought...
You fool!
But it's a responsibility...
I must KILL! Kill!
Erik's right! We'll all meet in Valhalla.
No... he's not... not... there...
And something to sharpen them with?
No, Mother.
But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
Hi, Joel. So no jokes about my name?
Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense.
You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there.
Anyway. Sorry. Hi.
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
I don't have one.
I don't know any jokes about your name.
Yes?
You're sure? It's cold.
You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
You know Wilmont?
I'm fine.
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
I think so.
Yes.
It's three.
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
Look at it out here. It's falling apart. I'm erasing you. And I'm happy.
You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --
I want to know you.
Joel, you're a liar.
Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
Really? Is he cute?
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
Egad, were you horrified?
No! I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons.
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
Come up and see me... now.
Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
yeah?
I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
Me too. There's this poem --
Yeah, maybe.
Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my heart. I'm so excited you know it.  Look, houses in which we don't live.
Let's move into this neighborhood.
It's freezing out here.
No, it's our house! Just tonight --  -- we're David and Ruth Laskin. Which one do you want to be? I prefer to be Ruth but I'm flexible.  Alcohol! You make drinks. I'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth. I'm ruthless at the moment.
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
Joel, come here. Please.
Have sex. Y'know --
I know. I spoke to my friend Magda.
God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
I know. I had to take the day to think.
I just got in.
There you are.  Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...
I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
Yeah.
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --
Oh! Great. That's great!
I had a good time last night. I really did.
I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
It's a good one all right.
Yeah.
What?
Sor-ry  We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
You made me have an abortion.
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
December 15th, 2004. I met someone tonight. Oh, Christ: I don't know what to do. Her name is Clementine and she's amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long.
Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.
I'm staying with the Countess.
About...
Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'
You don't agree with Debbie, then?
I wouldn't say that. I expect she's right, ultimately. But I'm with Delores when it comes to fighting for what's mine. I can't understand why Delores is so uptight about the Chink; he could probably teach her a thing or two. Ee! That grass tickles, doesn't it? God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits. Still this is cowgirl territory and I'll stand with Delores and fight any bastards who might deny it. I guess I've always been a scrapper. Look. This scar. Only twelve years old and I was felled by a silver bullet.
Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.
She's obviously that. Jesus! Which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies?
It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.
I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
Tired...
Oh my dear yes, I bought a little ranch out West, sort of a tribute to the women of America who have cooperated with me in eliminating their odor by using my vaginal products, Dew spray mist and Yoni Yum spray powder. A tax write-off, actually.
Sissy. You're trying to protect those scuzzy bitches. Well, let your conscience be your guide, as my mommy used to say, but it won't work. Those stinking sluts are going to suffer...
Justin?
Hold on, Coop...
You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole.
Roger that.
Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible...
What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
You're okay now, it's over...
I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers.
"Another man?" Who?
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
No. I don't believe in that sort of thing.  But if Dr. Weir is right, this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe, of reality. Who knows where this ship has been... What it's seen...  And what it's brought back with it.
What happened?
You didn't hear it? You must have heard it!
I apologize for the short notice, Bill, but we've had something come up that requires your immediate attention. Lyle?
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
Some things you don't get over.
The Lewis and Clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt, she's docked in bay four.
Yes, sir!
Justin.
Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
Alive?
Thanks.
I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --
You're insane. You've lost your mind.
Then who the fuck are you?
Your fear. Do you remember the Goliath, Miller?
I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.
We have a situation here...
She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
Justin?
But you can breathe it.
What's causing the readings?
Stay here! Don't stop working!
We've got to shut it down, we've got to...
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
I did.
Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own.
If they were in stasis, I'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. It doesn't make any sense.
Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
No, there's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind. It's as if time just... stopped for seven years.
Miller, Smith, Cooper, any of you in the airlock?
Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start now...?
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
I already got it. Everything I want.
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
I had it at four.
This makes five.
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.
Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
Go back to the drawing board.
And they're changing into...
I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window --
Ben, are you there?
Now.
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
You gave us names? What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
Blockhead started it!
Reed's always right. Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
What...?  Oh.
You remember in school we talked about working together. That's what I was about to explain...
I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
Arnold. What's happening?
How much did they cost?
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
No. I want my money back right now.
See that sign? It says 100% Money Back Guarantee. Do you know the meaning of the word 'guarantee'? Do they teach you that here? Give me my money back.
I am so tired. I am so tired of dealing with morons. How hard is it to...
Manager!!
Your friends use the pool too.
I take out the garbage.
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?
See you later.
Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
Ugh.
Oh, really?
What? Are you all right?
I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
What? Now?
It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
You should work for yourself.
What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. Whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. When you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have The Attitude.
No Damone. I don't understand.
I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
Yes.
And they don't call my parents?
How often do you go?
Well, it pretty much speaks for itself. Peter, you want to run with it?
All right. Die, Granada Jocks!
Just be glad you're all right.
My brother is gonna shit.
Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them.
Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
Climax together.
Listen to this... it says 'Most women derive pleasure from sex, but they don't have real orgasms.'
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
God, I don't think so. Better look in the house.
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
That little prick.
He's not coming.
He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
Sometime?
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
I couldn't make it in time.
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
You're gonna flunk me?!
It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
You keep them.
No. That's okay.
I'm fine. Mark, I'm so glad you came over here because I want you to know something. I just thought I would tell you that I really enjoyed getting to know you this year.
Two Cokes.
He is. Don't worry, I'll get it to him.
Awake? What do you mean?
IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!
Really?
You're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum.
That's a fine combination. You can't lose.
Why not? If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right.
Damn right!
My attorney understands this concept, despite his racial handicap. But do you?!
You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
Not yet. I want to study its habits.
To do the job, of course. Here we go... a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars!
What do you expect? I'm your attorney. You owe me five bucks. I want it now.
Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!
Can we make it?
Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.
That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on.
Whatever's right.
BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
She's perfect for this gig. These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her. We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own.
That's good. You can't be subtle in this town.
As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.
...then you'd notice about six huge hairy tits swelling up on your back...
Yeah... Explaining my Position. Some asshole wrote a poem about that once...
I fear nothing.
Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
I figure it's karma. You wronged me and you wronged your wife and you wronged your children, so this is karma biting you on the ass, or in your case...  ...on the eye.
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
Yeah.
Nah, I got the gun.
We're lucky to be alive.
Upstairs.
Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.
Look.
Who's with me?
Your parents of relation?
Nothing, this was my last delivery.
Well...
Gimme a couple dabs on the tongue.
How much you got?
Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.
Huh?
Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
Is it gassed up?
Four door?
Max?
Seven.
Seven.
Hey, when this plan completely goes to shit, what are ya gonna do?
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
I'm sure.
'Forgive'...? For What?
Oh well. I guess I better leave then.
Come here. I want to show you something.
Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
Where's Clifford?
I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!
He knows, Frances.
You have no right! You have no fucking right, you bastards! Get the hell out of here --
You're under arrest.
Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just hold her.  Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll clear her head. She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing.
All square, Doc.
...Don't you?
We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
One question. If I'm not myself now, just who do you think I am?
Thank you, Harry.
Thanks, Dad.
Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.
You really want to go?
Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.
They'll just catch you again, Francie. Besides, your mother will know.
I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain...
Occupation?
Are you really serious? About acting?
Why, you... you little bastard!
Not me. But other people seem to.
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?
Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy.
Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.
You're not the quiet type, Frances.
You don't know what you want.
Kaminski.
If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?
Help yourself. Everyone else has.
I should've known...
This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
How did I look?
I'm not sure.
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
You got it.
I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.
And you... should be proud. You won that contest and made a name for yourself.
Oh Ma, they're not using me. It's just a chance to travel, see things. Besides, it's the only way I can get to New York.
Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles --
Mama, what's...
What's wrong?
Where are you going?
For a walk, Mama. Just a walk.
I'll be back.
I'm going out!
Don't I know you?
And what's that?
This whole thing is a joke!
Oh, that's good, very professional. In control. But the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away.
Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
Huh?
I was watching.
Would you not? He was father. And mother. We fell from grace together. He from his God. I from mine.
It can't be as bad as that.
Friends? Do they live around here?
Why do you not go to them?
More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me?  What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice.  Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?
Your crime... as well as mine.
I don't know.
Then perhaps I believe in evil after all.
I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours.  You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein.
We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together.  No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow.
I'll be waiting. And watching.
Her body pleases me.
Fine.
Nothing can. Not ever.
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
Victor. I love you,
They've done a fine job. Hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend.
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.  You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.
You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
Somebody has to!
They'll hang him all the same.
Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
That's blasphemy!
There are sick people who need our help. Here and now. Not in some future time. Consider that.
I've been preoccupied.
We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
I didn't find what I was looking for.
Only if you'll tell me who he is.
Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.
Oh, now you have gone too far. There's only one God, Victor.
How is it you come to be here?
There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.
I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.
I guess...
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
Everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen. Annie.
You okay?
Maybe I can help?
Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.
Hey, guys!
No. There must be some in the desk somewhere.
I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's. Today wiped me out.  Thanks, Alice.
Somebody'll see.
We wouldn't want you thinking you're the only show-off in camp, would we?
Ned!
Rocky Road.
For two lonely nights.
I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.
Twenty-eight.
I said new, this is an '90.
The truth hurts.
They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us.
If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
My children are not going with you, and that's that.
Where is the little lady?
Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?
Yes.
Didn't like it, did ya?
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
Suit yourself, more for me.  Scotty?
Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too.
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service...
So all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door.
Not good enough, swear to God.
Good girl. Now, Scott, we have even less time, so I'm only giving you the count of three. One...
Everybody goes home!
Where are you taking us?
You damn well better. Go.
Get it and bring it up here, will ya, please?
In the morning, darlin', in the morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys through hell, and I know I've been one rough pecker, but from here on end you guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help me pick Richie up, and lay him down. Jacob, keep going on this road till you get to a sign that says, "Digayo." When you get to Digayo, turn this big bastard left, go on down for a few miles, then you see a bar called "The Titty Twister." From what I hear, you can't miss it.
I'm really sorry.
You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.
Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico.
We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.
I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.
What? Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
You believe me don't cha?
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
Feels good.
That's their standard deal, brother. They ain't about to change it for us.
These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word "barter".  You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.
Duly noted. Now, shut up.
No, I didn't.
Keep your voice down.
Or what?
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
Really?
Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
You know what you look like?
Where are you?
That's what I hear.
Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?
Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.
None at this time, sir.
Oh, really.
Would you have the discretion to end it right then and there?
Entering my scan now...
Would I be the only one?  The only woman?
There'll be more to follow -- but yes, dear, right now you're the pick of a very large litter.  And your success would mean a lot.  Jumping, now...
Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
What changed?
Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
The reality is this:  We send far too many men off to war.  I don't need to compound the problem with women.  Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life?  Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with --
Then I suggest we start there.
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
Every class has its surprises, Pyro. This one'll be no different.
You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.
She's a trainee, just like the others.  Why are you coming down so hard?
I was looking for him earlier, but...
Blank faces here, O'Neil.
Quick-hit technique used by Capone. Rigged a getaway car with running boards and handles.  All his guys had to do was jump on and take a ride.  Check the files -- DPRK-57 -- I doped it out as a contingency plan:  Seal Team infiltrates, picks up the package, links up with recovery sub.  But don't waste time opening and closing hatches.  They just grab the periscope and hang on for neutral waters.
Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
I feel like there's men here, there's women here -- then there's men.  But hey, what'd I expect?
Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.
Well, pardon me if I do.  Now who else?  Who could've leveraged a class officer like that?  C'mon, Jordan, keep your head in the game.
You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
He was married?
What, you gonna give it all up for a maple twist?  How dumb you gotta be? That's exactly what they --
Mighta been civilian.
I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!
I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
Listen, Sex Ape.  I'm here to stay. And if you don't want me for a roommate or classmate, you got two options -- move out or ring out. End of file.
Shut your hole, Slutnik.
Hmm.  Let's aim higher.
Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story.  "G.I. Jane" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all.
Okay, so now work it from the other end.  Think about California -- and how things might be handled there.
It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
No.
When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change.  I never lost my idealism.
I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
Oh my God! They're coming!
Nick Tatopoulos.
That's the problem. He did.
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
Are you serious? He's going to consider me for he job? What else did he say?
We? I don't think so.
Oh, thank you.  Is she always like this?
Where's Luc and Pierre?
Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?
Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
You're standing on it.
It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over.
You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...
No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh my God, she took it.
We, have already taken care of them.
It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.
I can't get through. I don't know what's wrong.
It's okay. I know her.
Well good, that's very... nice.
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
They're drifting toward me... I think they're magnetic!...
I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
Yes but, we were wondering-
Okay...  Okay, now what.
We'd never have the budget for this.
Well, that's the big question, isn't it?
What do you mean?
But you don't?
Yes Commander... All right, you're almost there. Just go through the chompers and over the pit.
Yes?
It's fractured...
... What does that mean?
Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..
It's suicide.
The lost footage. At the convention. The mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.
Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
A LATHE??? Get off the line, Guy.'
We're doing episode 31?
We made it. Commander, we made it.'
What do you want me to say, Gwen?... They wanted the Commander.
One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
Only answers to me.
Tell them? About...
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
Why does this sound so familiar?
We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
Sure, no problem.
What are you doing? What are thev doino? ~7C INT. SARRIS' SHIP	h37C
No! I swear I don't know! Please!
We pretend...
Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
Yeah. "Earth." Time to get back to "Earth," kids.
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
Wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars, we'll be there, this fine ship, this fine crew. Never give up, never surrender!
Then how did he find out about the device?
Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my crew.
We have become aware of these concepts only recently. In our dealings with Sarris. Often Sarris will say one thing, and do another. Promise us mercy and deliver destruction... It is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost.  But if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with Sarris.
But there it is!...
They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant...
Jason? What about me? What do I do?
Patience, Lt. . Patience.
Because they're coming right at us.
Fire at will. hI~D  NT. PROTECTOR
They always say that.
I wish she was beneath me.
Congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods -- probably their whores!
The man's waiting for you to get wiped off the stage so he can become commander and chief.
Someday, George, you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what Congress thinks that is.  It may come down to us, or them someday.  You or them.  Cicero was right:  was is 'a time when the laws are silent'.
While they're strung out?
Same old story.
What?  What are you talking about?
Yes, William.  I am apologizing.
Wil, I'm giving you your freedom. Do you understand?
I ain't forgot about the freedom.
What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?
Lafayette will not be happy...
That's Greene.  He's supporting our reconsolidation.
And is that the most horrible thing in the world?
It's a wonder they find the British cause worth dying for.
I am not conscious of it, sir!  But since you have thought it necessary to tell me so, we part!
To hell with Arnold...
You're asking me to be president of a republic, not king?  Not a dictator over subjects?
Who's in command out there?
George, we've got to get you out there before we lose our whole army.
Makes you gag.
Oh, come now...
These men have suffered but I believe they will fight.
We already have black soldiers in our army...
No, I did not.  Really?  Well, what the hell is a deist, precisely?
George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...
Uh... none just now, but...
Get these men back in line!
Surely you knew this was coming.
Of course, if it were that simple.  These people?  They're after something else...
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
I was born with a limp, sir.  The Militia used to hate it when I marches with them because my pike would always sway...
But you are an aristocrat and a slave owner.  Sir.
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
Perhaps you've been counting my acres, Mrs. Fairfax, and discovered exactly how poor I really am.
I'd throw everything away for you.
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.
Those people?  I doubt they'd think of this.  Ooo, you're wonderful this color!
That land belongs to the strongest.
God damn you, Sam Adams!  You wanted a revolutionary army and now that we've really got one it scares you more than it does the British!
Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
So where's the money?
I guess still in the locker.
I mean I don't care.
I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline?
So you didn't have the key with you.
You spotted them, huh?
You serious? This is how you guys do business? I can't believe you aren't dead.
I don't need a gun. Where is it? If it isn't on you, it's around here someplace.
I'd never make you as a burglar, not in that outfit.
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
She's been out of movies a few years, but she's good. Real good.
Lemme see if I got this right, you break into Karen Flores' house, ask me for three hundred grand, doesn't even belong to you?
I don't believe this.
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
You serious?
We'll talk about that, Harry. But first I gotta know, how'd you hook up with Chili Palmer.
That's the magic number.
Yeah, where've you been? We haven't heard from you lately.
I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
What I'm sayin' is the man wants his money and he wants it now.
Who is this?
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
Okay. So who are you?
Yeah? Which terminal?
What, like that's supposed to mean something to me?
You have a card in here?
Something shouldn't be there.
Leo spanked a waitress?
I produce feature motion pictures, no TV. You mentioned Grotesque, that happened to be Grotesque Part II that Karen Flores was in. She starred in all three of my Slime Creatures releases you might have seen.
That's right. As a matter of fact...
I don't know about his wanting to meet celebrities, that's something new. But, yeah, he comes to L.A. Then after that, I don't know what happens.
The shylock? He's barely mentioned. And it's not believable the wife would get a settlement that fast.
I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
Racketeering, that covers a lot of ground, doesn't it?
But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
Yeah, Chili. Hi.  You're fifty feet in the air!
Cash. It happens to be waiting right at this moment in a locker at the airport.
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
Tell you what, Harry, tomorrow morning, when the airport's crowded, I'll go check it out. If I don't see a problem, I'll pick up the money...
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.
It was in the Herald.
Hey, it's your book now. You want to check it out, go ahead. He's got a dry cleaning business out on Federal Highway.
Martin. It was a beautiful role. All I had to do was find the character's center, the stem I'd used to wind him up and he'd play, man, he'd play.
So you want to know.
Martin, look at me.
I'm looking at you.
Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.
You're not going to tell me the rest?
You don't open an account, Leo, you put it in a safe deposit box. Dip in whenever you want.
You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
Maybe you don't see my sign?
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
I know who he works for. Where's your phone.
I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons –-
...That's what we finally decided.
Man, can you scream.
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
Harry's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he'll never get off the ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help.
Yeah. Right.  Listen, "Touch of Evil"'s playing near my hotel. You wanna go check it out? Watch Charlton Heston play a Mexican?
You were supposed to wait for me with Harry at the restaurant.
Depends, who pays?
For starters, Marty wasn't Martin back then.
Are you going down?
You don't act like it?
Yeah, what'd he have to say?
Maybe you didn't hear me.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. Please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. Over.
Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
Damn mind of it's own.
Maureen.
Oh yeah.
A what?
What?
You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.
Threw a turbine blade.
Then it happened before they scuttled her.
Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit up.
So whoever did this might still be around.
Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
What the fuck -- ?
If money can buy what he wants.
Hell yeah.
You're a pal.
The guy. He just came this way.
Greer?
No. I'll try again later.
Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here.
Couldn't sleep.
Right here.
What?
The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends.
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
How's that?
So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.
Yeah.
Not for fifty million. An ocean liner maybe. But fifty million in gold, they come looking for.
Not much at all, I guess. Retire. Live out my golden years and all that.
You don't remember?
The coast guard has our last position. They'll send somebody out soon enough. A ship this size you can't exactly miss.
Must be a little too the truth, eh Dodge?
Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out.
You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
Not if I don't find that goddamn spatula.
I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.
Really? I never really cared for those. Why does the fat one always have to be so mean to the skinny one?
Oh -- please - don't let me interrupt finish your phone call.
Did you actually do this painting?
Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...
What do you mean?
So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
Yeah, right...
"Yeah, right"... well why not?  What's so wrong with me?
It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God, I practically love you, Josh!
What?
These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class!
God, think about that... that's actually totally depressing.
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
Or maybe not.
I remember every minute of that party.
There's my dad with Joanie.
I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
Fuck you!
What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
This kind of thing must happen to him all the time.
I'm afraid if I see him, I'll start feeling really bad again.
What, is she black now?
Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
We were such desperate sluts back then.
Fuck it. Everything must go!
Don't worry.
Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
What thing?
That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.
So should I come over?
Great...
I need to talk to you.
I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.
It just came yesterday...
See, that's exactly the kind of thing we're trying to avoid. 
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
Umm... That's not officially for sale... I might have to hang onto that for the time being.
Seymour does.
Him. Seymour. He's the man with the records.
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
Get a job!
...are you waiting for a bus?
Fine, and how are you?
Later, "Dude".
You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars!
You think it's healthy to obsessively collect things? You can't connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff...  I'm just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers.
But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
You work at Cook's Chicken?
What are you, a fry cook or something?
I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --
No, Doofus... blow it out!
No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?
Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
Does that mean you don't like me?
FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.
I hate sports.
Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.
Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems.
What do you want?
No... forget it...
I-I never expected anything like this to happen...
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
No problem.
Call me sometime.
Isn't this a wonderful piece, class? This definitely falls into that higher category of art I was speaking of earlier.
It's a tampon in a teacup...
Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
Very well, the job's still yours, I'll go. But if I have to return, you're finished. And I will then do everything I can to destroy your reputation. Am I not fair?  Told you you'd hate me. 
Who else would hire me?  Beat you to it, didn't I?  Oh yes, almost forgot- brought you a little welcoming gift. 
Well, he got away, didn't he?  Riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them- donkey took the brunt of it- then suddenly the lion ran off.
-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
All right- you'll spend your nights inside.  You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.
And anxious to get started.  What is this, mostly malaria?
That is precisely my plan- but back in my tent. 
So that's what a lion looks like. 
In your honor, Nigel. And you and Singh will be in charge of building them- and you'll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars- and you'll be finished in eight thrilling weeks.
Nigel, you'll just have to use your hands- 
That's what the books say... 
But it's crazy- the lion shouldn't be that hungry this soon.  Samuel?
You mean nobody died?
You just got hit.  The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions-  -and I'm going after them crack of dawn... 
The most of any lions... a hundred...?  Probably more.  Johnny...?
Actually, I could have done it much more easily without you, but for whatever reason, I'm glad you came. 
You give me hope, John. 
Oh yes. But it takes time.
Underneath.  Somewhere.
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
Hello, Dana.  I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to see if everything's all right with you -- you know, with the blackout and everything? Are you okay?  Is the baby all right?
Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night, Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs bite you.
Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.
I'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field.  It's a theory Ray and I were working on when we had to dissolve Ghostbusters.
Oh no.
How is he these days?
That's exactly what you said last week.
Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
I'll put him down for you.  You are way too short!  And your belly-button sticks out!  You're nothing but a burden to your poor mother!
I have a hamper?  Next time ask me first, okay.  I have more than two grades of laundry.  There're lots of subtle levels between clean and dirty.
Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.
It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.
I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.
So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can finish this later if you're tired.
Okay.
My pleasure.
We got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list.  Your name was first.
Okay, let me rephrase that question.  Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?
I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.
Then you should go to the police.  I don't believe in any of that stuff.
And we're the ...
I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Who?  Just -- someone we know.
Dana!  Dana Barrett!
You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.
Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
I guess he wasn't too popular at the end there.
What?  Yeah.
Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
Ummm -- figure eight?
All right, what happened to me?
No.  If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging that what happened was real.  I'm not ready to do that.
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
Who's the stiff?
I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
You must have gotten the last copy.
Take me now.
Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
What on earth gave you that idea?
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head.  Do you remember that?
It's hard to explain, but try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and finding yourself confined forever in another dimension.
Does she want to be?
Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
Or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious.  And I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.
Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
What do I say?
Oh, yeah.  This could be bigger than the microchip.  They'll probably throw out the entire engineering department and turn their building over to us.  We're probably the first serious scientists to ever molest a dead old lady.
Ray, I apologize.  I guess my confidence in the Regents was misplaced.  They did this to Galileo, too.
Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
Well, hurry up.  The needle's going wild.
Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
I can't take much more of this.  The pace is killing me.
Me, too.
Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
Right.  We'll believe anything.
What do you mean "choose?"  We don't understand.
We're nearly there, Lucilla.
Maybe you should get married.  Pick one of your cousins, it would demonstrate a profound stability.
I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house!  If it's worth something then sell it!
The fans of Narcissus.  They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying.
What have I got now?  It's exactly as if there were two emperors. Because of this the people have two minds.  He is their champion.
Gladly Caesar.
Until your confirmation date.
Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.
So am I.
He left us at dawn.
AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime.
The exact month when the Emperor must be confirmed!
That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace.  Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.
My only visits to Rome, Senator, have been through books.  But the war's over, time to close the door of war once and for all.
The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
I hope you live to see what I believe...
When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
That's what worries me...
Narcissus, I have your family. They're alive.  All of them.
Servis made it through again?
You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide...
The Senators admire you.
It's your job as a Roman officer to disobey such a summons.
Isn't the helmet magnificent?
If you win, you know, you have to stay.  It's the losers who get to go home.  Besides, I'm not so sure it is over.  Centurions report enemy scouts probing our lines.
Narcissus!
They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans.  Teach them, who we are!
You teach them!
I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.
Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
Alive... I'm alive...
Don't be ridiculous.
What the hell are you talking about, Greek?
You get to come alive again in the country!
The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
No -- why should I?
Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
I'm glad.
At the Zoo.
I've never been to it.
No.
I don't understand --
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
When?
Yes.
I just don't think it would...
Well -- I have to see Carl first.
Ben.
Mr. McQuire.
Plastics.
I said -- not exactly -- no.
What for?
I want you out of here.
I am going to call the police now.
Will you bring it in to me?
Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?
In general.
My husband took the car. Will you drive me home?
What for?
But it's light in there now.
Please.
What do you drink?
Why not?
What do you mean?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
What do you think?
So?
It's all right.
Sit down.
Her portrait?
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But I'm going home right now.
Jesus Christ!
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
Yes.
But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
I'll be up in five minutes.
Benjamin.
To tell you?
Yes?
Why don't you watch?
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson -- would you like to go to a movie.
Is this -- what?
On your first time --
All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
Art. Well what do you want to know about it.
Then why do you want to talk about it?
I got up.
What?
How many times a year.
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
Is it?
No.
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
Yes.
I'm curious.
What?
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
Let's drop it.
Did I say that?
Of course you did.
But it's not.
May I stay then?
Yes. Please. I want you to.
Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin. You are not to see Elaine again. Ever. Those are my orders. Is that clear?
I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you go?
Sir?
Yes. Well -- goodnight.
Yes, but I'm afraid --
Nothing else.
Oh, no.
No wait. Wait.
Well -- when did you decide all this?
I guess -- about my future.
What about it?
You got me.
What?
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
Yes, sir.
Ben -- I think -- I think you ought to be taking it a little easier right now than you seem to.
I will.
Yes.
Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
Twenty-one-years-old, ladies and gentlemen; four of those years spent accomplishing some rather extraordinary things at one of our nation's leading seats of learning --
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
Splendid!
No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.
Not now.
Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.
You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you.
Yes, I am rather.
Whoever is keeping you waiting.
That.
Oh -- work!!
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.
What do you want here?
And then --?
Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
I want to be alone.
That is not so -- you don't want to be alone. 
Beautiful but so sad. I did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom.
Really, I haven't a bit of character. None at all.
When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school, it was a monastery, I learned to pray and lie -- and ---
I know.
I --
Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a whole day. I'll be on that train.
If the Baron -- if you would permit me --
We could come to my room.
No -- not at all.
All right then.
All of that at once, Baron?
Insolent -- Berlin manners.
Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
And the child isn't coming?
I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, -- 
The Grand Hotel.
But Doctor --
For me? -- Oh, please, something sweet and cold.
I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important.
Yes -- and for me, it's going to leave at any minute. Let's drink.
To take dictation -- a Mr. Preysing --  Goodbye, you -- tomorrow at five o'clock. 
No - absinthe.
Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might --
You're trembling.
I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
Yes, of course, -- money!
Me.
Moreover...
Yes... A man I know took me to Switzerland last month...
Cotton Company --
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
Of course -- of course. 
Oh, yes.
You think so?
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
Mop rags --!
Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...
Then, it's all over?
What?
Oh no -- no -- the session is over. Let's go, it's off. Thank you, gentlemen. 
Preysing, you're joking with us.
In that case give us the articles. We'll sign at once. We know all the details...
Let us cancel the engagement.
Good morning, Madam.
Madam will dress now, it is late.
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
I'm cancelling the engagement.
Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get dressed. And what an audience -- the French Ambassador -- American Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- er -- er --
Such nonsense.
Yes, Pimenov.  One minute, Suzette, I will call you.
Yes, the police must be called.
The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
No, I won't wait -- I can't -- Every day is precious -- every hour -- Every minute.
The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?
I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
That.
Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
I want to keep my teeth.
That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.
I will. So long, Bobo.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
Henry, no!
One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
Not much time.
My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed.
But what's wrong?
But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
You always did.
Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?
How come?
Sure.
The first day of the Delmar meet, there was a nag called Bluebell. I should have been on it. But that was the day after you came in here, so I stuck around to see how you were gonna be.
We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants.
You do?
No. That was the point.
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
As though you do what I say.
I'll get it.
Oh? I didn't know anything was.
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
What?
Are you sure?
Roy? It this all we have?
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
Oh, don't be stupid.
You're a mama's boy, if you want the truth.
You ain't seen nothin.
I'll sign that affidavit.
Myra, I'm not following this.
I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
Where?
Not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks. But how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand?
Open your door.
I went out to Delmar.
She didn't see you, in other words.
But the setup's there. It's there now.
What I say is, no. We don't do partners.
I'm happy the way I am.
Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here.
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
Well, let's get the shock over with.
Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
Only the real stiffs.
What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
Oh.  Sorry.  I'm on my way to the ring and --
Checking out your place.
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
No.
Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
Why not?
I can't afford to get caught.
Looks great.  It does.
What are you looking at?
Can't it wait till Monday?  I thought maybe we could dance...  I'm very light of my feet.
Can't you hold it?
He gave me a fuckin' A?  Wow.
You're unbelievable.
Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.
Very insightful.
Have enough fun for the both of us.
Shit, Beth, why do we have to be the ones to organnize this friggin' fair? It's only Halloween.
Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some sleep.
What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
Debra, you're fuckin' insane.
Who are you?
It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!
That's the whole idea of living in the country.  I thrive on the seclusion.
Good.  I want around-the-clock surveillance on that house.
This is madness, Wynn.
Why did you take Jamie?
Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.
No one.
You know what gets me?
No.
At least we found the diamonds.
At least!
I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
This room is full of ghosts.
You know what gets me about that Cadillac?
I know, I know.  I dunno.  At least she's in the same house.  Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and there she was.
Haven't got one.
How do you know that?
Really?
Sorry.
Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
I dunno.
I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?
You did?
Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
Maybe it's time you got out.
Okay.  Okay.
They were enemies.  We were at war.
Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much." You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one.
Eight years you guys were together-- through thick and thin.
It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.
That can be arranged.
You're making a joke.
I wouldn't drop my gun.
Out!  Out!
Are you--
Are you--do you--
I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?
He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.  Were you in a war with Father?
We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound.
We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there.
When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
Mom?
What's this?
Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
I don't want to fight you.
You don't even know me.
This is crazy.
Some kind of animal?
Not at all.
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
I could carve a better man out of a banana!
You and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles.  You know who filled that bag for you?  Not Alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself.  Men with guts filled it, by God--men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles--suffering, ingratitude, loneliness, death--
You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again.  What we need is a honeymoon.  Let's start right now.
I'm not going to strike you.  I am going to be as gentle as pie--as lemon meringue pie.  You mustn't run away now.  This is your loving husband approaching.  I'm your husband.  Society approves!
I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?
It couldn't!
Go on.
His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
If he wants to go.
He cried.
Two hundred years old.
He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
Hope.
I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
What a handsome word.
May I continue with the rearing of my son?  Load that gun!
I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
And her fiancé!  How nice.  I hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says to the woman?
Chills, fevers, sweats.  You can describe it and name it after yourself: "the Woodly galloping crud."
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers.  But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth!  Correct?
You haven't heard me yet.
You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice?  Will I bleed from my every orifice?  Who will clean up this awful mess?
A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
I love you!  Have a cigar!
I'm an honorable clown?
Was I ever of use?
Don't shoot.
I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
Jesus.
You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
I told you this was a simple-minded play.
He's alive!
A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
To only exercise Dr. Woodly ever gets is playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace, everybody.
It's beautiful.
Anywhere but here.  I'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten.
No.
Then who flushed the toilet?
There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
I don't get it.
A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
I'm glad.
This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
I'm touched.
Marry me instead.
You were wonderful.
I'm glad somebody finally cried. Every time I come in here and see all this unnecessary death, I want to cry.  I don't cry, of course.  Not manly, you know.  Did she try antihistamines?
Wear a coat of domestic mink.  For the love of God, though, Penelope, don't lightheartedly advertise that the last of the jaguars died for you.
The what?
Meaning?
They didn't murder me.
We've got to rescue him.
If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that.
You're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque?  Take care of your body, yes!  But don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes.  Don't become obsessed by your musculature.  Any one of these poor, dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. Their magic was in their muscles. Your magic is in your brains!
I feel like I've been double- crossed.  If you'd just told me it was Harold's birthday--
What we offer here is nude body to body contact on a bed in a private room. It's twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars an hour. Anything else you desire may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tips are allowed. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
Big threat. TV would ream you.
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
That's cool.
I'm getting angry. I want some answers.  Where's the guy who runs this place?
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.
Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
What's that shade of blue called?
Yeah.
Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
You know her?
No. I saw her with Tod.
I am.
A friend.
You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
Not very.
What does that mean?  What does he do?
He deals in pain.
Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.
On your own land?
Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live?
Where is he, Niki?
Let me ask you a personal question, a painful one. The first of many. Tell me, was your daughter the kind of girl to run around, to, ah, play practical jokes, maybe?
As I was saying, I'll pick up the thread. There's a number of ways I can go. There's not much you can do here. Stay if you want. Maybe it'd be better if you went back home. Go through Kristen's personal stuff. Ask around, maybe she knew somebody out here.  Look, I do this a lot. I work at a minimum rate of $750.00 a week. It may seem like a lot of money to you, but it ain't. You could hire cheaper.
And better?
You like this, don't you. Showing me... this.
I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I did to you -- not that I did anything wrong -- that I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. Lucky for him, people don't look at his face.
You sure as hell haven't been any help.
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
What?
What plan?
Where is she? Where is the girl?
What you got in mind?
Okay.
It's a short film.
They're all about the same. You want something?
No, take it. I don't want your Goddamn fifty cents.
It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?
Cool off, huh? How's this for cooling off?
I'm worried about Jake.
You have to understand. He can be mean, self-righteous. He had a Vishund once. Loved that dog. He came home one day and the dog bit him. He took that dog and staked him out in the back yard. It was winter. Every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze. He's capable of doing anything.
The guy who bought you that ring.
Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?
How long have you been driving?
Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
None of that, lady.
Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.
What do you see?
I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
Oh, look! The birds.
Well then.
Oh, at the dentist's?
Well, then, you must come back and visit.
My door is always open.
Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals.  Of course, the age has its advantages.
Well...
But this is public property.
Oh, wait, Maude. Look!
Look, the ice is melting.
Superb.
Yes. It's almost there.
Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
How ingenious! Tell me about them.
Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
With Life.
... of you. You'll all end up like this.
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
I took them out.
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
Oh, Harold. 
Oh yes, dear. I took the pills an hour ago. I should be gone by midnight.
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
But why now?
Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?
To whom?
A sunflower?
Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!
I don't care what people say.
No. My uncle.
Just give me a rough estimate.
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
No.
You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?
No.
Yes.
Then why did you leave?
Yes.
Why?
What would you say?
I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
What kind of stuff?
Perfectly lovely. You know, this is what we're defending. Everything that's good and beautiful in the American way of life. Oh, there's some nut peace petitioner over there. Let's go off this way. Those crazy Commie bastards. I don't know why we tolerate 'em. Parasites.
You think so, sir?
ZAT!
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
Harold! That's <u>disgusting</u>!
Eh, yes, ma'm.
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
Yes.
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
Frank.
No. You look...
It's coming.
God, that's terrible.
The box? Like in your story? Like in his house?
I KNOW I don't have to. It's just my time of the month to be a complete fucking idiot. O.K.?
Nonsense, I...
Oh, pardon me. I obviously didn't convey my hesitation to take his story at face-value. No, YOU talk to me. But -- do me a favor? -- none of this DEMONS crap.
Story of my life.
It doesn't say --
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
The day Abraham Lincoln died. Hence "Abe" Sapien.
Oh, please. I'm not "pure of heart."
I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.
His what??!!
I can live with that.
Ah, I see. That makes it all alright then.
What are you trying to say?
I wish I could be more gracious but --
No. Don't --
Myers?
No. I never was.
Could've fooled me. Go away.
That's right, Stud, hold me down.
Hey. You: think twice --
What landed you this job, pushing "pamcakes"? Punctuality? What was your area of expertise?
Start in, you got nachos coming.
How big can it be?
Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
Don't know. Really. I grew up with him.  I've missed him too, but now, every time I see him, I get confused. Hardly a day goes by he's not in my mind. Even now, I feel he's here --
Who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? It's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem!
It'll go in.
It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from.
You solved the box. We came. Now you must come with us. Taste our pleasures.
I could lead you right to him. You could take him back to Hell instead of me.
You took quite a beating. You must lie down.
First things first. You can have a telephone when we've talked. Do you know who did this to you?
We'll get you a phone as long as you promise to stay put.
Kirsty?
No.
Well can I come in or not?
I'm very happy.
Sure you are.
What happened to you?
Not know.
And you came back here to solve the puzzle --
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
There's very little I can do about it.
No. I'm not.
No argument.
So damn stupid.
What are you talking about?
It's better you see for yourself --
What?
Not much.
I wonder, maybe...
That's right.
Am I?
Wait a moment --
O.K.
She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.
Really?
I have to get out.
It's late.
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --
Just go. PLEASE. I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad. He'll look after me --
'Bye.
Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
But now I kind of like it.
It's not my car, now is it?  It's Laura's car, and thus Laura has it. So it's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab. Wow.  Fucking great.
What are you snickering about?
I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here.  I don't understand any part of this conversation.  You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen.  What am I supposed to say?
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
Barry, you're over thirty years old. You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey.
NO--!
Oh well.  Nevermind.
Nothing.  I just prefer the other one.
Nobody.
Your desert island top-five.
Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
What do you mean, four more?
Is that it?
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
C'mon, just answer the question. You can say what you like.  What the hell?
Oh God, no.  I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
Okay.
Sure.  'Course.  Rob, look.  Do you want to... talk about it, that kind of thing?
Liz, hold on a second --  What?
It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
-- and who says I like Marvin Gaye, anyway?
I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.
I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?
I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
You must have known it would happen. You couldn't have been entirely unprepared.  Like you said, I've been living with the guy.  We were bound to get around to it sometime.
I'm not -- hold on...
Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?
That bad, eh?
I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you?  I mean, how much are you making now?  Sixty? Seventy?  And you were living in this shitty place.
Mmm hmm.
You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
Don't worry about it.  Just get into bed.  Worry about that when you're better.
Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do.
Mmnn.
I didn't mess things up because I was scared.  I slept with Ray because I was sick of you.  And I needed something to snap me out of it.
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
I'm too tired not to go out with you.
But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
You're tougher.
More confident, maybe.
You're being stupid.
Has Drag City Records, I know, I know.  You told Dan Koretzky about this?
We took care of that.
I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  To me.
Enough of what?
I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered.  Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo.  But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself.  And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know?
Yup.
I'm sure it isn't.
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
Right.
So so.  Up and down.
What do you mean?  Where did she go?
It's the best collection I've ever seen.
Give me fifty bucks and they're all yours.
Thirteen hundred.
And I won't take a penny over ninety.
I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
We're not there yet, Justin.
Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.
Sure.
Happy birthday.
Thanks.
I don't follow you.
Anything in Maryland is close.
It's not mine.
It's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years.
Miss Cartwright, unless you have come here to sell the sword, there's very little I can help you with.  Now if you will excuse me, I have a great deal of work to do.
Basil the II.
Good day, Miss Cartwright.
Dupont Circle.
He's dead.  Whatever I may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now.
Why not?  I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
There's a catch.  You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing.
Yes.
A factor of age.
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
You killed those other two.
Sometimes innocents become involved.
I can't stand it.  Oh God, I can't stand it!
Not power.  Not control.
Call your mother.  You never call her.
Four?
It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
Stop!
Your marks would suggest great injury.
Yes.  Always.
We are immortal.
But we cannot be killed.
Oh, the boy has a mouth, now if only he had an arm.
It's like to kill me first.
You have not been fully trained. But you will learn.  And you will be good, I can feel that.  You have apt- itude.  This is why our friend is so concerned.
Who?
No doubt.
I know you very well, Conor MacLeod. And I can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you.  Mulet, Romirez, they were fools without vision.  It was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players.
Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you.
Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
What are you doing here?
You're insane.
No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon.
Not so long.
It's all we have.
Did you know the victim?
I presume it's a sword.
Where were you Tuesday night?
Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind you I'm 74 now.
No.
Why don't you fellows get your own news?
Seventy-five.
I'll give you a hundred and a by- line.
Bon jour!
Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
I'll come a-running, pardner.
If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
I'll be careful, darling. You be, please.
For a minute, I thought maybe Walter Burns was at the back of it. But then I realized he couldn't have been.
Thank you.
Oh.
But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
Taking the train today -- and being married tomorrow?
No. My mother.
Just for the first year.
It's simple. A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down.
How?
Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
No, Bruce, you didn't come between us. It was all over for her before you came on the scene. For me -- it'll never be over.
Ts! Ts! Ts!
That's the kind of stuff they want!
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory!
No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter. You wouldn't know the old girl now.
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?
Bermuda.
Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
What do you mean?
We're not interested.
No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified.
Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.
Oh, get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!
Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
Where's some paper?
Call him a love-child, if you want to.  Duffy!
Is he coming back here?
You been in a fight?
Was she? Did you notice?
If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!
Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
In a way.
Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it!
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
Sure.
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
Sure I do. And I'll tell you something else -- I'd like a baby.
I don't want to rush you. Take a couple of seconds.
Sure, Heaven! You've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in -- to get a new story for your paper!
And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
You're crazy. Where's Mac?
Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
It's a deal. Let me up.
We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
Yes, sir.
Run down and get some smelling salts, will you?
It's easy for you to talk. You're retired. We're still working.
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
What's the dope, Sheriff?
That's all right.
The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
Where he used to live. You can catch the Riot Squad -- it's just going out.
Yeah. But I --
I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night.
Twelve dollars! -- For those rheumatic uncles of yours?  Out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it?
Fred!
Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side.
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
Cover up that transmitter!
How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!
Well! Looks like about ten years apiece for you birds!
That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.
Oh-h-h... was she hurt?
But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
Come on with that money!
Thanks. So long, Hildy!
That's good.
Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could.
Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs.
Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.
There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
Yes. Isn't she beautiful?
They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
Quiet, Mollie!
The reprieve for Earl Williams.
You can't get him on the phone. He's out duckshooting now.
I couldn't work in the city. You see, I've got my family in the country.
I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade.
Pinkus.
No! It's easy -- it's very easy!
Come on, fellas.
We want to see you.
You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.
Very well, Grandpa.
With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
Looking for shrapnel.
Bloody.
OK. You're in.
Ask her yourself.
He's the worst liar.
I'm starting my own collection.
Well, for the baby, really.
They might be.
Why not?
Naturally.
I will if you will!
And the bride.
What's that?
Well, it's off ration. We know that.
How do we know they didn't plant it there? They know we're mad on jam.  They could poison half the country.
The ideas you get in your head.
That's why you never liked me. I'm different from you. Well, everything's different now, so it doesn't matter. So there.
No, I won't.
Don't leave it like that. Go after him. Swallow your pride.
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
Or what?
Wasn't it lovely?
We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
I wish it could all have been different.
And now we're glad you did.
You know something, Molly? I like it on my own. I never got used to sharing a bed, not really.
Really, wow, so it's really a real thing.
Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate?
I always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken... smile, say cheese.
Yeah, come on.
You're welcome.
Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
Holy crap, thanks!
The Duke?
You mean John Wayne?
But if you did.
Y'all find us country people real funny like don't ya... well, God damn pack up the mule and sling me some grits, I'ze a gotta get me some schooling.
If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot.
Yeah, no shit.
Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
So, the guy goes to Hell and the devil says, "do you smoke?" The guy say, "yeah"... the devil say, "great cause Tuesday is cigar night, sweetest Cuban cigars you ever had."
Shit, we really need to find some gas.
Then the devil asks, "do you drink?" Guy says, "yeah"... devil say, "wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks night, best booze you ever had... all made from the finest stuff."
Really fucking awesome.
Way out here?
I'll help ya.
Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.
Tasted pretty good.
Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut you?
Where ya headed?
What!
Drive through it!
How's about you give me those same directions.
That kid is one horny retard.
Yeah, doesn't hurt himself, just spins it around next to his eyeball.
I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
Grab Mary and come inside.
I don't want to see that.
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.
Think, think. Try to open the lid, try to kick a hole in the wood.
Someone is out there...  ...help, we're in here!
Wait... quiet. Turn off the radio.
Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
Yeah, no mercy here.
Shit, I wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em.
That's the understatement of the year.
You find something, Georgie?
Yes, sir.
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
Oh, right.
What do they call you, sweety?
Firefly.
No, not really. Good kid, never been in any trouble.
Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
I always favored the Hulk.
Hulk was dumb as shit.
Excuse me for a second.
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help.
Like father, like son.
Woof.
Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very important man and...
No. Don't be silly. It's just...
No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry.
Yes. Happy happy.
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
No! It is now that you must decide.  I love you, Doctor Nathan...  ...but I will not wait. I will not be your chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish.  My love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from you.
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
Urgh.
Take me, darling! Tame your little monkey of love!
Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you!
No!
That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!
I don't know.
I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
Oh?
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm.
I don't care. I don't care!  Like what, for example?
Do you?
Of course.
Fifteen.
Yes.
What?
I think we should go. Please. Before he wakes up and, I don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do.
Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.
Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain. He's going to make me famous.
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
You are an animal.
Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot.
Really?
My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly valuable to the project.
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Oook. Oook.
Now, my diminutive friend, what can I do for you?
Yes... Derek.
Yes.
Pittsburgh?
Mm hmm.
We're neighbors now. You can call me Sarah.
Do we need words?
And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?
I didn't ask him can he beat you. I already know he can beat you. I asked him will he? With Eddie, that's two different things.
Sit down.
Pool.
You being cute?
I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got talent.
So I stay. Stay until I hustle up enough to play Fats again. Maybe by that time I'll develop myself some character.
A thousand.
See that big car parked out by the fireplug on the way in? Well, that's mine. I like that car. But I get a new one every year because I make it my business to know what guys like you and Minnesota Fats are gonna do. I made enough off of you the other night to pay for it twice over.
What's that supposed to mean?
I told you. I got drunk.
Thanks for the drink.
Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't you? This game isn't like football. Nobody pays you for yardage. When you hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way.
Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.
There are places. I'll scuffle around.
Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and they'll eat you alive.
Now, when did you adopt me?
Where do I sign?
I been thinking.
I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
What's that supposed to mean?
Play it again. Learn something.  Fats went in the john, see? Washed his face, cleaned his fingernails, made his mind a blank, combed his hair, came back all ready to go.  You were through. You saw him, you saw how he looked. Clean, all set to start all over again. Hold tight and push hard. You know what you were doing? You were waitin' to get beat. Flattened out on your butt, swimmin' around in glory. And whisky. Probably deciding how you could lose.
I got time, Bert.
Fifty per cent?
Aaaahhhh!
What kind of straight pool game you like?
Want some free advice?
Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?
You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.
Why?
Let's get back on the road. You gotta be at that convention in the morning.
Eleven thousand four hundred, cash. Here in my pocket.
If that's all you got, that's all we got left.
I asked around.
A son.
Talk to me, Charlie.
My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
Well, hello. Haven't seen you in a long time.
Would you like to come out tonight?
Yeah. You must come again.
Yeah. Sure.
You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
Try me.
How come you didn't catch your bus?
I'm not.
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
I've got something in my bag.
Me. It's Eddie.
Would he know?
He knows. A lot.
He's a gambler.
Yes, I need them very much. And if you ever say them I'll never let you take them back.
Sure. Let's go home.
Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it.
Well, what's the matter?
I'm a little tired.
Shut up.
That's right.
Well, you shoot big-time pool, Fats. I mean, that's what everybody says, you shoot big-time pool. Let's make it two hundred dollars a game.
Twelve. Cross side.
Mm hm... Two ball, side pocket.
You know I gotta hunch, fat man. I gotta hunch it's me from here on in... One ball, corner pocket.  I mean, that ever happen to you? When all of a sudden you feel like you can't miss? I dreamed about this game, fat man. I dreamed about this game every night on the road... five ball...  You know, this is my table, man. I own it.
Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.
Listen to me, my blood somehow... helped you.  It could help all of you.  We could find some way to --
Where you lived with them.
I don't know.
Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
If we want it, it is.
Where's your car?
Is that all he said?
Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.
You people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. I'm of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle ... What sort of training do you have anyway?
Mr. Gardner, I don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.
She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge.  She must've been behind the hill.
Why?
No, but it was here.
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
I take it you've heard.
Then get them out of there.
That's the good news?
...and we'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture? That's my man.
What're you talking about?
College nickname.
She didn't take my name when we were married.
It's perfect the line is busy?
This I can see.
Just getting a feel for her.
Roger, Eagle One, our primary target has shifted course.
I think our secret is out. They're headed right for us.
It had been deemed classified.
Christ, why didn't you say anything about this when they first arrived? You could have warned us before we launched a counter attack that cost us hundreds of American pilots!
No Sir. Definitely not.
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
What?
I know, you like to make a big entrance.
I'm a dancer.
It's all fuzzy.
Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
Not all too dissimilar to us. Breathes oxygen, comparable tolerances to heat, cold... probably why they're interested in our planet.  Hey, you wanna see them?
These three died in the crash. Their bodies are as frail as our own. You just have to get past their technology, which is, I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.
Peace? No peace.
I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.
Well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they mean.
Alexandretta. Now we know.
It's war.
Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones, I have a passion for antiquities.  Have a look over here. This might interest you.
My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper.  Can you translate the inscription?
The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.
Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway.
You could be more right than you know.
Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Doctor Jones?
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
You know something, Doctor Jones? You're absolutely right.
We're through!
I knew it was you --
In that case, I permit you.
Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up.
Out!
It's important!
Dad, they come in through the doors.
No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
Yeah?
She talks in her sleep.
Try and burn through the ropes.
What?
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
Marcus would agree with me.
Hmmm... What did we talk about?
Fly... yes. Land... no.
It's a new experience for me.
You call this archaeology?
Ready.
After you, Junior.
But, Indy --
My soul is prepared. How's yours?
My name is Kazim.
The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years. And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.
It's like the voodoo dolls of West Africa. The kryta represents your enemy -- and gives you complete power over him.
No, he's a very shrewd old boy. Power behind the throne and all that. He actually runs this whole province.
When she saw the insects she passed out cold. I carried her back to her room. She was sleeping when I re- entered the tunnel to look around.
No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --
What're you talking about -- I'm not a dope fiend! I saw it! I'll show you!
Sorry, I thought we were just talking about folklore.
That was a misunderstanding.
Dr. Jones -- I want Nurhachi.
Okey-doke, Indy! Hold onto your potatoes!
Sure, Indy -- three tickets! You, me and Wu Han --
Okay, Shorty... see you in the morning... I'm going to have a little -- word with Willie.
What?
They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
They came from Palace and took sivalinga from out village.
Long ago -- before my father's father.
The airport... No, look out, Short Round! Left, left!
The old man saw it in a dream.
It's pulling me deeper!
Can you move your arm?
She might get away with that act here, but she'd never make it in a real nightclub.
What -- the bug?
Gee, I wouldn't want to touch an ugly critter like that!
Willie, come here! Hurry up, we're in trouble!!
Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!
What above the curves?!
Not quite.
I know you did!
Al ???!!!
I'm...inside you.
Why not.
Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD!
I told you, my name is Al.
Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
No. Don't tell the guards.
I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.
What do you mean we.
Thanks.
I'll sue.
We have to get out of here.
Just walk down the hall?
That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
Gone where?
Use my credit cards.
It's illegal.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
You'll be me.
It's sand.
.
Where are you staying?
What are you looking at?
Not blue enough.
But the rest is me. I'll dress like I want.
Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
What glasses.
Oh, you were right. They've all been here before... met just last week.
I...I'll got to the movies. That's what I'll do!
Osaka?
Fountainhead of High-Tech.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Al, you leave my heart alone...
I can't see a thing.
Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got...
While he makes the run.
Well, don't let it. What are you doing?
Where've you been?
About what?
Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
Some friend you are! You know what I hope?
What part what?
Do what? What'd you do?
Dieter?
Let us get to the border!
What a nerve!
Me.
You have nothing...
Bit expensive, sir.
And how do you service foreigners.
I think I've heard of you.
Do what?
Don't you want to get out?
Not you. Them.
Who?
Been complaning of hallucinations.
Much better now, thank you. Just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon...
You...him...UST.
I said...I didn't say..anything!
Then who did?
No. No one to speak of.
Without what?
...I...don't know.
...and sort of...disinterest.
You are.
You talk to yourself.
...Naw. Made that up.
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
Wanted to get to know you.
Who else is interested in me?
Why did they leave?
No, he didn't do that.
He didn't.
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.
Dieter's gone to shoot a still job. Hong Kong.
Maybe I'm wrong. Then GRUNER won't be here.
For you.
You're gonna laugh.
Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this.
If he was able, what would he say.
It will be fine. You have another.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
Perfectly.
It will.
Hi, Daddy.
Where?
In the backyard.
You got a deal. 
Sure. Where?
Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.
Sure.
Maybe later.
How about you?
Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of "Kools" to the world.  "Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones with the story, I believe we're sitting on an exclusive.
Catch ya' later.
Well, at the end of the day... because of your segment... the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company... could own CBS.
Jim, it's Lowell.
Is there any more rice...?
Try the car.
What are we supposed to do...? What about our medical coverage; what about our health? What about our car payments? The payments on this house?
I'm doing an interview.
My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
Let me call you back...
I got perspective.
Who is this?
No. No, it's okay... How's -- how's the new place?
Alright.
Well, actually, no. Well, he's on the fence. That's the point.
What chance is there of getting Jeff's interview on the air...?
Bring a tie so they'll let us in the front door...
No shit.
Oh, torture? Great ratings.
Who are these people?
Oh, lots.
Give me a break!
In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...
Because I think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. So you care about what you're thought of in America. And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a face.  That's why.
No. We don't do that.  You've seen "60 Minutes" and Mike Wallace. So you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity. You also know we are the highest-rated, most-respected, TV-magazine news show in America.
Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
If you want to do it.
How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
It's okay.
Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! I never abandoned a source!
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
A can opener! A $39.95 can opener. I canceled payment... It was junk.  You ever bounce a check, Lowell? You ever look at another woman's tits? You ever cheat a little on your taxes?  Whose life, if you look at it under a microscope, doesn't have any flaws...?
That's not the point.
You called me.
Dr. Wigand, you do understand what could happen, don't you?
...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.
Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business.
And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
I'd rather play than talk about it.  What did you want to see me about? I don't like being back here.
Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.  About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion...
That's why we hire scientists...
So she's uh, flourishing?
-- and we are sure...
Uh... poetry recitation.
Got any symptoms?
What?
No.
Oh boy. If he only knew.
I told you. I was hungry.
Have you ever been married, Miles?
No.
You don't believe in it.
Gotcha.
To him? He's a sick freak.
Howard is a beautiful person.
I am thrilled for you, but tell me this... How'd you get Howard to do it? I've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion, but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea.
Thank you.
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
No, we're not!
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.
Do you want me to sleep on it?
Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --
You can't prove anything.
Marylin?
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
I don't see how we can ever find our way back from...
Fine. They were created during a dictatorship.  What if something happened to you? What would I tell little Gus when he asked "what was my daddy like?"
Please!
We do have a man for you.
So where are you now?
What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
Right.
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
That's attorney client privilege.  Sorry, Miles. But as a great and clever man once said, What's good for the goose --
I'm not sure.
No. You're not.
Is she going through with it?
HA!
I'd stay away from her, Miles.
I know you would, Wrigley. But would Kramer?
The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
"I found a million dollar baby—"
Yeah.
The reward.
Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
Yeah—with all the trimmings. Now, how about the check. Do I get it?
A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts.  She's my idea of nothing!
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
I'll get it annulled.
What've you got against King Westley?
You're going to finance him, I suppose.
Oh, no.
On the road.
It doesn't matter.  I don't want to stir up any more trouble. I've been doing it all my life. I've been such a burden to you—made your life so miserable—and mine, too. I'm tired, Dad. Tired of running around in circles. He's right, that's what I've been doing ever since I can remember.
Are you going to see him?
What about that diamond wrist watch she had on—she can raise some money on that?
Someday perhaps, you might even take charge.
No?  Say, listen—I've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministers—some of the most powerful people in the world—but I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listen—if you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
Oh, no. She'll be crazy about it. Well, see you later. I'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space.  Goodbye. 
Yes, of course.
I haven't the slightest idea.
Yessir.  There's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them?
But the lady says—
Ma spent it all for the tickets. She didn't know it was gonna be so much.  We shouldn'a come, I guess, but Ma said there's a job waitin' for her in New York—and if we didn't go, she might lose it.
All right, let it go.
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.
Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
Phone for help?  We're right in the middle of nowhere. There isn't a town within ten miles of here.
Don't tell me your ticket was in it?
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  Here's your ticket.
I found it on the seat.
What are you talking about?
That's right. You didn't.
You have your nerve!  Here, boy—!
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?
This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. 
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
Like what?
Santa Claus?
King—King Westley was in it.
Don't look at me. I didn't marry King Westley.
What are you talking about?
There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?
What's the matter?
You didn't give that boy all your money?
I'm following you.
I don't think there's a "piggy- back" rider in your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who was a good "piggy-back" rider.
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
know—but—
Clever.
Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're broke—and hungry—and everything looks black. It's a long movement like this—  —with a follow through.
Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on—
What'd you give him for the car?
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
A headline? You're not a newspaper man, are you?
Come here, you little fool!
You bet we did.
I heard about your stunt. That's swell, King. Just think of it—the groom lands on the lawn with a plane. It's a perfect beginning for the life we're going to lead. It sets just the right tempo.  Come on, King. You're lagging. 
You ain't gonna stick me for no phone calls. You can go down to the Sheriff's office.
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. 
Bridge washed out—around Dawson.
Up yonder. See the lights?
What!  Say, listen you!  When you get back to New York, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this office—unless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours. 
You're drunk.
Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
You!
Oh, boy! What a yarn! What a yarn!  Get me Hank on the phone. Gotta hold up the morning edition.
Thanks, Joe.
What?
Well, you got one now. —Come on, fill 'er up.
Yeah.
Five G's—or I crab the works.
Huh?
Nice guy. Just like you. But he made a big mistake, one day. Got kind of talkative. Know what happened? His kid was found in the bottom of the river. A rock tied around its neck. Poor Bugs! He couldn't take it. Blew his brains out.
Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it.
The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist.  They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match.  I'm beginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro's door.  If Oswald, or someone purporting to be Oswald, had gotten into Cuba, come back, then killed the President, the American public once again would've screamed for a Cuban invasion...
Not one word.  That's an order.
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
And Oswald?
Get home my ass.  We're going to the office, have another drink.  I want some company tonight.
I couldn't be more serious, Jack. Those big red eyes have me wondering about your loyalty.
I always lock my files.  And you were the only one here today...  What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
...rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement.  No one really knows what they were doing there, but everyone sure saw 'em. They stood out like cottonballs.  I got whites and blacks saw 'em, but last time I checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote. We still got the Negro junkie, Vernon Bundy, saw 'em talkin' at the seawall near Lake Pontchartrain.  But it's tough, boss - no one wants to talk about Shaw.  He's...
Old stains, Bill, but just as telling.
It went to the goddamn FBI and they didn't find a goddamn thing.  It comes back a week later and one guy in the Dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all I know he could've taken off Oswald at the morgue.  There's no chain of evidence, Bill.  And what about the tow guns actually seen in the Depository?  One an Enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a Mauser, described by Deputy Weitzman... Maybe, just maybe, Lee Oswald was exactly what he said he was Bill - "a patsy".  Take it at face value.  Lou, Susie, I'm going with my gut here.  He's got an alias of Hidell to buy the rifle, "O.H. Lee" to rent the room, right?  What's in a name, right?  In intelligence, they're assumed to be fake.  A name is sort of like a postbox number, a code - several different people can use the same name, right?  Then why can't somebody be using Oswald's name?
Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.
Jesus, they must've been hard pressed to come up with that one.
Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson was involved?  The President of the United States?
If it's a suicide, I seen weirder, Jim. 
...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
Dave, do you think we're out of our minds?  The whole building's been a zoo since that broke.  We can't get a thing done.  Reporters crawling everywhere.  You think we want that?
The Fontainbleau?  20 minutes?
...give me protection?
Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
No, I never saw him before in my life.
Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
Everybody!  The Agency.  The Mob. The Cubans.  Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out.  Here, in Dallas, Miami.  Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle.  My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he's somewhere in Miami.  You're on the right track.
Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
I had the cause of death.
Sure it is.  Freckle Face, if I ever handled a minor felon like that, it'd be all over the papers.  I'd catch hell.  And this is the alleged murderer of the President?
I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish.
But he never writes, speaks, or does any propaganda for the Russians.  He meets Marina, whose uncle is a colonel in Soviet intelligence, at a trade union dance; she thinks he's Russian the way he speaks, six weeks later they marry, have a daughter.
None!  The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.
Presumably so he can now exercise his intellect stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.
I wonder about the Williams'.  Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's, but his description came after 1 P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's been tapping the Williams' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying "We both know who's responsible."  Who called?  Why's the Bureau been tapping them?
Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  As you well know.
Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
Come on now, we'll talk about it at the table, dinner's getting cold.  What are you doing in here?
Well maybe you're right, Jim.  I'll give you one hour to solve the case... until the kids are in bed.  Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can wait 'til morning.  Come on, everybody say goodnight to Daddy.
Honey, in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test.  Oswald was a radar operator.  He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas.
Tough day.
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
What?
Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
I'm leaving.  I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving!  I won't stand it anymore.
Oh, I don't know anymore!  I believe there was a conspiracy, but not the government.  I just want to raise our children and live a normal life! I want my life back!
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
Oh no!  No!  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
And it ain't pretty  ..."the AD has spent more than $8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since November, 1966.
You know who the mayor was?
No.
You never got anyone killed, boss. Their actions killed them years before.  If we stopped now, it'd be even more wrong.
That's exactly my question, Jerry. Maybe I'd better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what I am talking about.
I'm not with the Agency, Mr. Garrison, and I assume if you've come this far, what I have to say interests you.  But I'm not going to name names, or tell you who or what I represent. Except to say - you're close, you're closer than you think...
No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.
You never ask a spook a question. No point.  He'll never give you a straight answer.  General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.
His name?
I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
Hold on, Jack.  What's the problem?
You're so naive, mister.
Even your own wife, Numa.  Any of you want to quit, do me a favor... put us out of our misery.
Yes?
Yes.
What are they?
Then you don't stand a chance, Mr. Chief Justice, you have a lost cause. All I want is a lie detector test, and you refuse to give it to me. Because as it stands now - and the truth serum - how do you pronounce it - Pentothal - whatever it is. They will not give it to me, because I want to tell the truth... And then I want to leave this world.
I know. That's why I went.
But then you told her you were home.
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
I need a favor.
A bit.
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
But the only way to help you was to do that, so I did it.  Okay, how 'bout this? After we're through fuckin' with these Koreans, I take you to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles. My treat.
In his inside coat pocket.
How'd you know where he was?
She wants to make a deal.
What's in it?
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
But you're not going to stop her?
You know, I figured out the other day I've written something like fifteen thousand bonds since I've been in the business. I'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want, I can help you look at your options.
The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
No, you didn't. What branch?
If you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law, why not pack a hundred grand?
Black's fine.
You went out this morning and bought a gun.
Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point.
Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin' to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell.
Surprise.
How was it?
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
You talk them into it?
They seem to like the idea.
A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?
Are you scared of me?
Who's side are you on?
And cooperate? You might get probation.
It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute?
I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
You ever see him sell guns?
No.
I thought you were going to let this one through.
I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
I never have. It's not my money.
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after.
There was a guy with Melanie?
Not in the fitting room.
This guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara?
If it'll make you happy.
We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
You already knew that?
Do you got something for me?
I understand woman, damn!
It's a cockatoo.
Didja tell 'em anything else?
What the fuck's that got to do with it?
Who?
Yeah, I think a woman.
The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before...
Well, you weren't supposed to be there.
Not when it's my ass on the line you don't. We do this my way or fuck it.
Man, I don't like that part.
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
Designer clothes.
That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
I can sit through it once.
Where at?
Two months shy of four years.
What for?
Bank robbery.
Coughing opens up the capillaries. When you cough, you're getting air -- in this case smoke -- to parts of the lung that don't normally get used. Coughing's good -- gets ya higher. My dad coughs when he smokes all the time.
I thought you were sixteen.
I was pretty much the same height now as I was then.
The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco.
You been to Japan?
That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
Not really. We didn't have much to say to each other anyway. I never got to know him that well, but I knew enough to know I wasn't missing much. I keep that, because of all the fuckin' time I was there, that's the only picture I got of me in Japan.  That's Japan.
...and just take it from him.
Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?
Lemme have the bag.
Are you serious?
Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
You're outside?
Uh-huh.
She believed you?
Hang it up, she's on her way. You gotta listen to this. This involves you.
Twice. In the parking lot.
Well, if you had to do it, you had to do it. What we don't want is that bitch surviving on us. Anybody but that woman.
Where's the rest of it?
That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right.
I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
I didn't really think anything of it. No -- I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend.
How am I supposed to know that?
You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other?
The door was opened, so I just came right in.
You didn't hear?
Beaumont worked for you.
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
Is that what I think it is?
All I did was walk out with it.
My office.
It's in the safe. She can't get at it.
She's all alone.
No.
You sure?
'Ola!
Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead.
No! Oh God.
You want to see me? Well, here I am.
LET GO!
You see this line here? It's your life line. Here's where you were born. And this is where you got married. You're a married man, huh? Oh oh. Nope. Divorce. See this split.
That's right. We did.
Listen, Jake. I gotta go.
It's cold.
Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
A doctor? And what's he gonna do, tell me I'm crazy? They've fucked with my head. I've got to prove it. You've got to do something.
I don't have to do any such thing. I'm eating my lunch, okay?
What did she have to say?
I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
She talk about the boys?
I thought you said she didn't say much.
What? She threw me out, remember. She wanted some professor to carry her far away from Brooklyn. Only we didn't make it. She can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in.
Yeah. You. Every time I see you. No more Errol Flynn, okay? Your back won't take it. You tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you.
I know.
I've seen it. It's all pain.
You ever read Meister Eckart?  How did you ever get your Doctorate without reading Eckart?  Good. Okay, let's turn over gently. Right side.
You can do it. Come on. Easy. Just give it a try.
Not tonight, Louis. No more rest.
The postal service. I'm a mailman.
Ah!
Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, I might agree.  Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with?
Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
I'm not cold.
I didn't want to wake you.
Gee, thanks a lot.
Who? Jed?
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?
Yeah, but for what?
That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.
What do you mean you can see?
Well, you didn't marry her.
What's wrong?
Why do you bring her up?
Demons, Jake? Come on. They're winos and bag ladies. Low life. That's all they are. The streets are crawling with 'em. Don't make em into somethin' they're not.  It's the pressure, honey. That's all it is.
Come on. What were they, Jake?
Hey, I'm here.
The numbers stop at 107.
Goddamn it. Get in here. I can't stand around waiting.
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.
Are we in Brooklyn?
You are the most unbelievable woman I have ever met. One second you're a screaming banshee and the next you're Florence Nightingale. Who are you? That's what I want to know. Will the real Jezzie Pipkin please stand up.
You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the fucking news!
A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
How do you know he's telling the truth?
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
It's so hard to believe.
It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
You have quite a mind, Jake. I loved your friends. That chemist - the Ladder. What an imagination you have!
Hold me, Jezzie. Hold me.
You've lived with me for two years.
You know goddamn well what I mean.
Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
Mid-town mostly.
West.
Sit down!
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
Observation, mainly. Clinical study. You were one of the survivors.
Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.
One drop?
I don't know what to say.
Hot. Where do I sign?
I'm awake?
I'm sorry.
Jacob Singer?
You in trouble?
Who is?
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.
They're back here.
Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.
I don't know!
What if they're carrying? Did you even check?
Right now, I care only for the safety of this crew. You don't know anything about these two -
That's exactly what we need to find out. Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you where discovery is concerned. Now step aside. I have a medical emergency to deal with.
Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the only way you're going to live.
Not an option. I'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down.
We have to get off this ship.
You'll be fine.
I think so, why?
She needs a little time.
Oh I like her a lot.
I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
They are not going anywhere. I cut power to the  shuttle.
Well, do something!
Forget her, she's a pain in the ass. Let her hang there.
Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found.  Adrienne! Stoney!
Let's just get out of here.
So what else is new?
Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie...
I'm afraid I cannot assist.
Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
That's right, now if you could...
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
I know who he is...
All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him...  ...along for ballast.
Don't tell me my business!  Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.
'cause when we bought the house it was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the dogs.
Do you see the kids?
I never hear the whistle.
I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.  Ship it.
Ow.  He's gotta be more careful in the water...
Michael! Come inside!
No. Home here.
Martin, we hired the best man we could find.
Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben...  do you have all the pictures you need?
Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that?
No, it was local jurisdiction.
Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.  Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?
No, we just checked the beach...
Swell.
About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
You could say that.
What stinks so bad?
What? What?!
No...  You think we can get back with those?
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
Looks more like the readers of the National Enquirer.
I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend out-of-town papers. Amity people could take care of this.
Twenty years.
I can't believe that people pay money to go fishing. This is really dumb. This isn't even relaxing... it's just boring.
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
Well... is everything all right?
Transplants?
The shaft is giving.
Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.
Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.
I don't know...
Whose idea was it?
Is that normal?
Oh. That's a relief.
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
Oh, hey Vijay.
Yup.
I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in.
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
But I'm going to give it up for adoption. I already found the perfect people.
Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking!
A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?
I know enough.
Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!
Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
Sorry. I was just getting something.
You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
Yeah.
Well, we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage. It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed.
I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
You haven't heard the Carpenters like this. Listen.
It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was?
God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?
Yeah. Mall madness, huh?
Why?
You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events.
I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
What are you?
Oh, hi Juno. How are you?
No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating.
Well, it was nice seeing you.
Sure.
No, no, I don't think that, Juno. It's just that, we went through a situation before where it didn't work out.
No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
You're pregnant?
Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm ill-equipped.
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.
Well, of course. Your old D-A-D! You know I'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.
Jesus, I didn't say it was.
I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
Bleeker and I were going to go to Gettysburg for spring break.
There are ads? For parents?
I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular.
No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.
Or stage parents!
God, Spermy. Must you always feed?
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
What do you make with that?
She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process.
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
I know we're prepared. I just don't know if... I'm ready.
Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock.
Don't mock me.
No, it's fine. Thanks for making the call, I guess.
Yeah, downtown.
That French ain't it?
Is it hard to learn?
Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early found a picture of me like that I'd be black and blue for a week.
You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
That's not true!
Well... the very first thing we're gonna do... is get us a couple of six packs of Lucky Lager and climb up on toppa' that famous Hollywood sign and howl at the moon...
Bull. That ain't right... Government sends people there all the time, just don't want us to know about it.
I heard that.
Go back to the car and keep Brian there. I don't want him in here...  Do it Adele... Now!
Not so good. You sure you have to?
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
...Too bad.
That your... "theory", ain't that what they call it?
Ain't you goin' to record it?
Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game.
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there.
Damn right I do.
It was definitely the high point of the evening.
Mmm... I love it when you talk like that.
Well, I sat down with my tapes and your photographs, which are great by the way... and I started writing.
We don't have enough money, but we'll figure something out.
Beggars can't be choosers. They were the only ones who answered the ride share note, remember?
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
Carrie.
Look again!
Where's Adele?
No, but I can tell you he's not gonna be too happy about this.
Yes. Altogether.
Were they wearing condoms?
You're clean.
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
Yeah.
Den less go Joe.
A little bit. But I didn't really want her to.
It is right.
It's no big deal, right?
You down with the boost?
No, I'm serious man. I'm dead ass. Do you wanna try? We could be like the fuckin X-rated "Wonder Twins"!
He looks like my uncle.
Darcy. Benny's little sister.
Yeah.
She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.
Why not? You stink.
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
You have?
Yes.
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
I don't know. I've never seen any of them before. Cornballs from Jersey on X. Feelin' the effex.
What do I want to do?
I wouldn't believe it?
Were you protected?
Yeah.
Everything is wrong.
Yeah. Right around the cheeks and chin. Boy did I have a crush on her. She was the first girl I ever put my tongue in her mouth.
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
Is Telly there? This is Paul. Who is this?
Of course. How am I gonna forgive him after what he did?!
Mine are like my neck and my chest.
It's like yeah whatever. But when you fuck. You wanna fuck that person. You're like ripping each other's hair out. Ooooh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No.
But then I won't need your money.
Hello?
Yeah. I had sex with Jake, and it took him like an hour and a half.
I can't man.
Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid.  Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please.
OK.
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
Oh, we'll be back.  You can bet on it.
He says it's a game.  All games have a strategy.
Maybe you should.
How'd you get in here?
Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.
I've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich?
What do you mean, stand out?
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
Oh, c'mon.  We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we?  It doesn't mean anything.  It's Sanderson!
You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
You'll find her.
Pain?  Pain is just a state of mind. It's something you learn to live with. I have.
Very good.
They think that you and I are doing this together.
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
Don't beg, Peter.  She has to die.  I can't win unless she dies.
You still haven't figured it out, have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours.
The scars on your chest.  From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen.
How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
Come here.
Boys.
Nice meeting you.
Nothing.
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
How long has she been dead?
Yeah.
What do you think he did?
What did he mean by Huxley?
The most logical choice.
You know, I hate to say I told you so, but I warned her.  Coming home at all hours of the night.  A young girl new to the city.  This neighborhood ain't what it used to be.
Do you know how she found the apartment?
Only in passing.  To say hello to.
To my room and then I went for a walk.
It doesn't make sense.
I understand that this is just another one of your games.
I want to be the best I can.
Mate in five.
That's a very personal question.
I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?
Do you always open quickly?
Are we talking about me, or chess?
She could be dead after the game.
Another kind of game?
Oh, but it is.  He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  That's a game.  It has rules and objectives.
That's true -- but the emotion is still there.  They just learn to control it.
What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- I want to keep things on a professional level.
Are you going to tell me you didn't feel something in there?
How could you?  Unless you were there.
Because I think he's wrong.
No.  But I'm open to distractions.
And you?
What?  By attacking me?
Does anyone?
Call room service.
If I have to.  I'm going to take a shower.
For emphasis?
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
You're wife died.  You can't feel responsible for that.
It's not that easy.
But I do.
It's got to be grammatically correct.
I got lucky.
Do we have a future?
I don't have to go through with it either.
Never mind my ears! Go away!
No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.
I will find you. I will be with you.
I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...
I don't know how.
The new Queen lives.
The Fortress moves?
Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
Everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death.
Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.
He has come for Lyssa.
Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen.
Yes. To keep her from you. But now that we are inside the Fortress, you will be able to contact her.
Use your sword.
I don't think that.
I ache with it.
Let me comfort you.
I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
Staying alive.
No more, my lord - my friend. With Ergo the Magnificent by your side, your enemies are dead men.
Yes. It will double our range.  I know at least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap.
Well, it is true that if I received a royal command I couldn't very well disobey it, could I?
Would you desert your friends?
Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
I must take the old man to see some sick children. Kegan will guard you.
Oh, my poor stomach.
<u>Me</u>? Travel with <u>you</u>? I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision. And I do not travel with peasants and beggars. Goodbye!
Well, at least I'm glad to see you have a sense of humor. That's the first smile I've seen on that gloomy face of your's ...  ... isn't it? It isn't. Oh no. Oh dear. Oh now I've gone and done it.
Then look!
A match for your son, I think.
I will seek the Fortress for you.
There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here.  We'll find her.
Yes.
It is too late. He has drunk.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
But you would not stay with me.
I killed him when he was born.  This place is my punishment.
You will come with me.
There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other.
Yeah... How do you know it?
Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
Do you need money?
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
Huh... 500 meters?
130... 140...
Whoever.
OK.
Too heavy.
Mathilda, stop, please!
What shall we do?
I think.
...Why didn't he close the window?
I don't grow up any more. I just get older.
Yeah, what?
Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...
Fine...
...Yeah.
Here comes the resume.
Uncle Maurice -- I spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... I have a rented car outside, just listen to me.  Come back with me now, and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we'll plan a car trip across the country -- Gerald and I will come along --
I'll make it.
Uncle, the way I was told, if that police car didn't happen down that road, you would be dead right now. That guy Denny, had jumped bail in another state, he's dangerous... They'll be other Dennys, if you don't plan.
A couple days to a few months if untreated.
Thank you.
No, I just don't want anybody dying because I didn't say something when I had the chance.
Pardon?
Routine, I assure you.  I just wanted to gage my health.  Am I healthy?
I've seen it before.
You're feeling old and you want to start exercising.  A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth.  Don't feel embarrassed about it.
What do you want from me?  Would I swim across an ocean for you?... Would I walk across the United States for you?  Yes... Yes I would.  You know that.
No.  But I want to take a walk with you.
Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech.
I asked the officers if you had committed some crime... If they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now.
I'm not proving to her.  I'm showing her.  And I know I don't have to.  I want to.  I've realized, love is about giving. I'm alive, I can still give to her. I want to give her everything I can.
If he's in trouble with the law -- fine.  Not our problem.  He yanked two people from a car wreck, let's give him some space.
Not our problem.
Maurice and Ellen Parker... it was issued in Philly... Mr. Maurice Parker has come a long way from home.  Why?
Jumped where?
Who's telling this story?
What was that?
By car right?
What Mr. Parker?
It's mine to risk.
Where am I?
Hello.
What do you mean?
No alcohol?
What do you think I should get?
No.
Water?
Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.
To death?
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
OK.
No. I think you're talking about you. I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, I'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul.
Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
I warned you...  ...but I'm sorry.
Thank you, Sera.
Yes... I guess I knew that.
I don't know. I'll find out though.
I want this, Sera. I need this!
Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.
What do you think... you are sixteen years old on Hollywood Boulevard?
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
I believe you! Don't worry.
Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?
I'm a man who knows what I want.
How about --
No!
She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
What's the point?  Look at me.
Licensed attorney or family member?
Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you.
Serious?! Who the hell does he think he is? You're the most popular month on the USC calendar!
Your scrunchie?
Margot!
The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
Wow. I'm glad I met you.
Maybe not to your face...
Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."
I'm quitting.
What're you talking about? You earned it --
Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty- hose. No more trying to be something I'm not.
What if you're trying to be something you are? The hell with Donovan. Stay.
Are you asking me on a date?
I just don't understand what went wrong --
What?
Where's Warner?
Why not?
I'd rather have a client who's innocent.
I don't know --
Elle -- no -- your boobs are fine --
You got into Harvard Law?
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
How was I supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on?
A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.
And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?
I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney.  Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.
But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke.
I didn't stick around long enough to watch him stick his swizzle stick in her mouth, but I'd bet my next check that that's where he was about to put it.
Where's the Rock?
Helloo... you let him have anal sex with you.  Helloo... you let him videotape you diddling yourself.
Delusion... a kind of magic which works against the magician.
You should glory in your animal nature.  It is your triumph!  None know that better than I!
Do you feed on mice and rats?
What do you want from me?
I don't expect you'd understand.
Might we watch, too?
Then you'll understand my quest.  An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
Flozen foleva not good.
An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?
I'm in no mood for dancing.
No... I... I need to rest.
You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad.
I meant no disrespect.
Didn't you now?  Well then, answer me this riddle and all be forgiven.
Mayhap you be the one what's lost, and she safe by the castle hearth... but, come Jack, we'll warm your bones.
What does she want from me?
Don't you know?
Jenny Greenteeth?  Who's she?
Think there be truth only in beauty, lad?  If you've the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws, Jenny Greenteeth has the answers you seek.
Fie on what she thinks!  You mind her claws and teeth... Cast your spell, Oona.
There's the spirit, lad.  If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up.
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
I'll drop a cow on the knave!
A true and troubling question, Gump... We'll start from where the unicorn was killed.  The Baron must have left a trail.
Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned.  A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.
Pure gold it is... plays a different note every time.
Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.
Aye, so long as you're not too greedy for the bait.
We do both.  Our frontal attack a diversion whilst we drive a tunnel under...
Nay.  You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine.
I don't... understand.
The alicorn, lad.  Come to your senses!  Unless we find Baron Couer de Noir and bring back the horn the world is doomed.
I admire your valor, Jack.  By all means, seek him out... But first, we needs visit the kitchen.
Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron.
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
Might not need a gesture quite so grand.  What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world?
Where?
And did you?
Nay.  It was lost.  When I came up for air the pond was frozen over.
Rise, Screwball, and into the basket with you.
Or perchance...
If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
Is what you said about the ring but another dream?
And I love you, my husband.
Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
Grand champion, is it?  And what great cause leads you to me?
Thought the weather terrible of late.
I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.
A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
Not very precise directions.
Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
Is she fair, this princess?
Far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not.
What a fine meal you'd make, be the rest of you sweet as your tongue.
Only that?
I had no thought of offending you, Oona.
Wondrously so.
You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
And as barren of love as stone.
Come on, Gump, let's have a look at this witchcraft.
Bah!  You faeries have the morals of ferrets.
Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest...
Jimmy Squarefoot no lost.
Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
You follow.
We did a lot of the wiring too.
Mom said I should.
And why was the alarm on?
Are you his friend?
Nope.
I've taken a lot of morphine.  Oral morphine...for my back.  Can I wait till I can say no and sound convincing?
What are you doing here?
I wanted him to marry her.
Hand me a towel.  I'm getting out.
Does everything have to have a point?
Not really.
What?
You'd hate him for the trick.
I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today.  Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn.  The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.
I mean, but did you both go camping on weekends?  Listen to music?  Masturbate together?  Talk on the phone?
Months.
When we divorce a decade ago, she was very, very angry.  Now she's just hostile.
That's too long.
She's out with a friend.
Oh...okay.
Where are you?  You're driving me crazy, waiting like this.  I want you in me now!
Hey, it beats letting town folk go down on you for the summer.
You don't know what the deal is.  There is no fucking deal.
I'll be around to check up on you.
You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
I'll hate you forever.
Goodnight.
It bugs me.
I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.
You'll have money when you work.
You'll have money when you work for it.
You can't make me do a thing.
I like how it feels not to feel.
Nothing.
I know parts of who you are.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
Why wouldn't she leave?
I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
Are you taking them still?
Yes.
I never tried to get you to like me.  I tried to get you to love me.
I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave?
I don't even care if he ever comes back.
You let him pierce his nose?
You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life.
What did you do with your dog?
I wasn't thinking.  Look, I'm sorry I didn't think to call you while I thought...I think.
Why call me?
There's nothing anymore to stop me.
When's school over?
I'm married.
I can't leave the house?
Last time you were gone for a week!
Let's go.
What?
I used to live here.
Sam's favorite.
Do you remember?
It was perfect, George.  Amazing.  It was so real.
Oh, I'm worse.  Much, much worse.
What is it with this?  They wouldn't spend less time with Peter if they lived here!  He has no time!
That was the truth.
It sounded like a pick-up line.
'I'll be in the bedroom.'
It's not my back that's killing me.
You got any weed?
Everything happens for a reason.  That's what my dad said.
The payoff.
Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
What?
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
What are you doing home?
You live a fabulous life, Robin.
Okay.
I locked the door!  Get out!  I locked the door!  Get out!
Depends on what I'd give up on.
I don't know what I'm doing.
Yeah.
You could keep it and rent it out?
This is what he wants.
Better make it a week.
It's a boy! Well, let's get a look at him.
Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
Sharp.
She's alright, isn't she?
Take care of me?
I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
Want me to come back some other time?
Goodnight, Claude.
I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude.
A job, huh? Well, that's nice, real nice. You won't have to work long. I'll be back soon enough. After I start work at First Federal Bank of Manhattan, I'll be keeping you in style. Everything will get back to normal again. That's a promise.
I'm Sylvia. What's your name?
I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an eye on my friend.
I don't think so.
Good old Monroe.
Did those two muscle heads shake you down? Swear I've seen them down at the track with Sure-shot Riley. That's it, ain't it? A gambling debt.
You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
A thumb? What do you mean, like cut it off? For ten bucks?  That include the tip?
Start your job? What kind of job?
Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
When there is, you can forget about it. And I swear to God, you ever talk about my daddy again I'm gonna kick your bank-telling, loan-denying ass, you got me?
Are you kidding? Tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there.
Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
You know what I'm saying.
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
Claude.
What do I want? What makes you think I want something?
My daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet.
Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
I said you're soft.
That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now.
I'm sick of watching Camp 12 win the championship. Every year they get to roast the victory pig and we get dick. This year I want that pig.
He said they keep it parked out behind the barn. Can't be that hard to fly a plane. Lots of people do it.
I don't see you coming up with any plans.
I ain't getting in no airplane with you. I'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept. They threw us in this shithole for life. Don't you get it, Ray? We're gonna die here! Might as well head up to the cemetery, pick a plot and start digging.
Then I have nothing left to say to you.
He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here.  We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!
Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys.
I said you're soft.
Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
I try to moisturize regularly.
State of Mississippi wants this ditch cleared by sundown. You got that?!
What happened to 'em after that, Willie?
Hey, Willie, what was Claude's plan, anyway?
Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
You don't have to twist my arm.  Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.
Excuse me, sheriff. As we explained to your associate here, there's been a mistake. We didn't kill anybody. Now, as for the bootlegging, we happen to work for a very important man in New York.
He shoots me, I swear I'll take you with me! I just want to hear you say it.
Anybody else need anything read?
You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
That's my joint. The swinginest nightclub in town.
They'll be sending you up there soon enough. And not just for a visit, neither.
Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
Maybe we will. Nice meeting you.
Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.
Understood.
You shouldn't have come here.
I lowered the drinking age to ten.
Why should it end? Who's gonna stop us?
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
You mother...
Try an angel.
I can't screw.  I can't screw.
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
That pain is hunger.
Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
Look. You were really high. Things happen.
I think you're looking at him.
He superimposed your head onto "Scarface."
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
Son, just do your best.
I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything!
What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
Coulda been much worse.
It's Stanley, sir.
No.
That way.
Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
You followed him?
You keep a bat under your seat?
Yeah. Deep south.  She laughs along with him, not sure why.
You have a dog? What kind?
Okay, I do. Get back up here.
East Rutherford.
If it's Cassius, yes.
Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!
You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember?
Never a pair. I have never had a pair.
Up there.
We're ready.
Your own work?
No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape.
Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering.  You know, Logan -- you wonder a lot. Too much for a Sandman.
Well... you can't have them all.
Yes.  But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
Please... No.
You prefer women?
Sad? What made you sad?
Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
No.
I thought I had to do something.
And?
About what?
Then it's still no.
You know.
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
A Runner gave it to me.
And I never heard of Sanctuary.
What do you need?
Let's see -- how long has it been?
We'll convince them.
How will they know we're coming?
Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
Of course.
Yes, do you think that's why he looks so sad?
It could be...
There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
You're wrong!! It has to be!! It Just has to be!!
"Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity."
Gracious... no.
Have any other people ever passed through?
What makes you think so?
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
Never, never, ever. Nothing.
Can you make it back?
Clear Logan-5 and Francis-7.
It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?
Pile in.
Yeah.
If anything else happens, you'll call us.
Or something.
Or not so recently?
Yeah, I remember.
How would you like to take me to dinner?
Me, too.
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
No, honey... It was part of the deal.
Yeah.
Are you gonna be a man about this, Pete?
I don't know his name. He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think.
Yes, I believe so.
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
Sit down a minute.
The police called us.
Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.
Yes.
Are you hungry, honey? I'll fix you something.
Where is he now?
We'll get a tail put on him.
Who is it?
Coming up.
Nothin'.
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
That's why I married you.
Who's it from?
Called? When?
From the club. You didn't answer.
I wish I knew.
What?
Just a minute.
What job?
I wouldn't... The brain would know what's going on. Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity. Savage pain, Marian.
Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
Okay... Lemme clear it with...
At sixty?
What'd I tell ya.
Okay.
No. No, I don't.
Sure.
Last time I saw you.
Sure. Sure I do.
You really don't remember?
No... I told you.
I don't know.
This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
Okay, brother.
I see.
Well, it looks to me as if we're traveling west.
Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south—
Oh, really?
Yes.
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
Yes.
You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had.
Horns? What kind of horns?
You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
It's unbelievable.
Gold. You were going to—
Why, you look beautiful.
Sure - sure. Don't you worry. I'll take care of you.
Leaving?
Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!
Shall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.
How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?
Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
Who?
Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.
I mean, your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it?
No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
No porters here!!
Yes.
You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]
"Ungrateful fool . . . !"  Those were my very words to myself last night. "Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."
I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
Yes, Bob.
Do try to sleep, Bob.
The bloke up there looks a Chinese, or a Mongolian, or something.
It's not knowing that's so awful, Bob. Not knowing where you're going, or why, or what's waiting when you get there.
See that spot?
Well - I mean—
Chang! Chang! Chang!
George. George - do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.
I will, George. I want to tell you. I'll burst with it if I don't. It's weird and fantastical and sometimes unbelievable, but so beautiful!  Well, as you know, we were kidnapped and brought here . . .
So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
I'm not wrong. She told me so. Besides, she wouldn't have to tell me. I'd know anyway.  I found out a lot of things last night.  I'm not ashamed of it either. It's probably one of the few decent things that's ever happened in this hellish place.
was saying—
In for what?
Where are we going? Huh?
I saw a man whose life was empty.
A man whose life was empty!
You're absolutely right. And I had to come all the way to a pigeon house in Shangri-La to find the only other person in the world who knew it. May I congratulate you?
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
Bump?
When the plane lands at Shangri-La and wakes us all up.
Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.
Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.
I'd love it!
Why?
Forgiven.  You know, when we were on that plane, I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it. That silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys, covering ten times the distance of the plane. It was always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed. And I've been thinking that somehow you're that plane, and I'm that silly shadow. That all my life I've been rushing up and down hills, leaping rivers, crashing over obstacles, never dreaming that one day that beautiful thing in flight would land on this earth and into my arms.
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
Thank you.
Sorta literally gets ahead of himself.
Oh. Shit. it's in the car--
Yup.  Sure is.
Sir--
I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
It was a long time ago.-
Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but--
Let's see... that was second gear..Kay shifts into THIRD.  Jay winces.
Gee.  You really think?
Why did Mikey leave Nazca?
Get back in the car!
The Pentagon.
Oh no, I can't do this job by myself.
Why does it feel like the only thing scarier than having a bunch of aliens on the planet... is having then leave the planet?
Kay.  Seriously.  What if he actually means what he says?
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
Why not?
What is it?
What the hell does that mean?
Maybe you need a closer look.
It's... coming.
Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
How'd you know that?  Kay?
I need you in Philadelphia.  I got a code 90, in a-high school.
Actually, I don't know...
Oh shit!
That and, well... I want my friends to see me on CNN.    Okay, I will admit it: ours is an illegal hookup.  We'll gladly pay when you can get your trucks out to install it.
Is it now?
He won't.
You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...
And replace them with new ones.
Here --
-- go blind.  I know.
This about the Justice Department?  They laid on a tour for tomorrow a.m.  Told me to wear a tie.  You like this one?
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
So she cleaned up.  Where is she now?
The nation votes this week...
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
Don't apologize, John.
So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
I'm not getting halo'd.
I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it.
Beauty?  The precogs don't even always agree with each other!
You're kidding, that's today?
Get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside.
Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
But you call this room the "temple".
You gonna tell on me?
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
Uh, I'll try...
Sean --
Good-bye, Dad...
Sean, wait...
I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
Good-bye, Crow.
Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
The system would collapse.
The safest place of all.
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
Which one is that?
He's dead, Lara.
No.  That's what everyone thinks.  John shot a man dead in Baltimore six months before.
Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
Yes.  This is from the twins, Arthur and Dashiel.  Agatha's stream was missing.  Now this one is from the cyberparlor.  Anderton downloaded it directly from Agatha. Watch...
I'd love to, but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
I can take you down there.
Is it the good room?
It's on West Broadway.
So you're models?
He's alright.
I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did.
She's, uh, sleeping.
It's daytime.
No.
I want spaghettis.
I don't know.
Yeah. Are you sure mommy's not home? It's very late.
I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky won't shut up about it.
Get your hands off of her.
Come on, dude. The other chick's giving my best man a blow job in the toilet. I know the drill, I'll wear a rubber --
I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
She'll be out in a minute.
Quick drop. In and out.
Ricky's taken care of.
She was fast, huh?
Never won a race. But it got me in with the trainer. We'd have a thing, I don't remember, some fucking thing. The jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd all go running. People get greedy. First they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. Within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. The odds would drop, I mean you could watch the goddamn board. It looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast.
So, that's it. I'm out?
Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.
What is it?
Take a few days --
We get it. We're sorry.
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
No. Just the cross streets.
Well, this is the corner.
How am I being shitty?
Shit. Who we kidding? I know I suck, and I held you up for ten rounds --
Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.
Nah, don't bother --
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
No. Look. There.
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
Yeah, I guess.
They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth.
Don't even start.
What the fuck is that supposed --
I mean, that's what I heard --
Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
Missing what? He didn't say shit.
He wants to see us now.
I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
Wait a minute. You want to look at fucking penguins now?
Did you hear what he just said?
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.
You did?
They only cover one fifty in incidentals. You've been ordering fucking... Motherfucker...
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
Take us right to Kennedy. Now.
I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in?
No. I'll wait here.
Fine, fine. And you were...?
What do you mean 'kinda?'
Yeah. I want it.
I'll get you the list of videos, if you don't mind, I'll offer the other passengers a beverage.
Yes.
I don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?.
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
Does anyone want another?
I hear the China Club is a laugh.
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
How's it going?
Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
That's alright, man. It's a little early for me to drink.
Yeah.
Four fernet.
Yes. You're going to New York.
Yes, sir.
Some fuckin guineas he sent me. It's midnight and the motherfucker's ordering an apertif.
He has a cute what...?
I am.
Yeah. This shit's fucking brilliant. I just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. I gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. It's illegal back home, you know.
You better not be. Cause if a cat toe you down in this town, you better stand up or make tracks.
Heard where?
Lemme write it down for you.
I'm there, daddy. Wheww. I'm cool enough to kill.
You know it.
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
Why? Why does everybody conk?
You the only cat don't come on with that "Whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss none.
But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary?
No. That's the name of the slave- master who owned your family. You don't even know who you are. You're nothing. Less than nothing. A zero. Who are you?
Who are you?
I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
I want to. God knows I want to.
Next week, Brother Minister.
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. Tell me something: how tall are you?
Talk about what?
We need you too!
What do you want me to do?
Families shouldn't be separated. I'll never make another long trip without you and the kids. We'll all be together.
At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
Let's get out of this cold.
Malcolm, where are you? We've been calling all over the city.
I don't want folks to be searched, it makes people uncomfortable. If I can't be safe among my own kind, where can I be? Allah will protect me.
What did I tell you about assuming?
Let's cancel.
Just what is your question?
Just what are you saying?
You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
Allah Akbar.
Sure, man.
"His greatest greatness."
And like a fool I believe it.
But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book.
What for? I ain't white and I don't put out.
All of your children are delinquent, Mrs. Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief.
Did you hear me?!
C'mere.
Well, all reet, then.
You're too small to be Bogart.
I ain't doing bad.
Man, the name musicians ain't got shit. How you gonna have something? I need a stake, a bundle, a grand. My woman can't afford it; my homey ain't got it. How about you baby? What you got?
Yeah.
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
What can you do?
Don't you call me boy, you pig. Letting a man bleed like that.
Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.
All these photos you just saw were of policemen. Sadly they're protected. La Hermanidad. The brotherhood.
It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
So you are going to talk me to death.
So where do we begin?
You don't, I'll call you. Oh! I have a tape recording that I am sure will interest you.
Deal.
[The what?]
[We don't know! We never see his face! We have to wait in the other room. He was screaming to the girl that...]
[Who's Tazinari?]
[Not for a long time, sister.]
[You are Jorge Ramirez.]
[Ordered by who?]
[Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.]
[In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]
[I told you, non-negotiable.]
[This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where --]
[And one of the founding members of La Hermanidad.]
[It's all up to you, commandante. Tell me about you and 'The Dreamer'.]
[O.K. So tell me more.]
Yes.
Show me, please.
I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here.
I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
Sorry I woke you, Ray.
Two days gone. They're negotiating a ransom.
That's right.
Not at all?
I go to school, don't I?
Everywhere!
White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.
I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
You need to practice.
Good things happen, too, Creasy.  Like meeting me.
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
Then be trained.
It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes.
Then don't come.
She understands men.
[The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. It may take a few days, but you're going back.
You do?
Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby.
Don't forget your towel.
I think it's fantastic.
She's young. She'll get over it.
[That's good. Really good. He shot and killed two judicial cops and a kidnapper died in the attack. They're saying he's responsible.]
The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends.
What was she to Creasy then?
That big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend.
We took them home alla way out in Brooklyn. Her name was Mary Feeney. What do you say? You think I oughta give her a ring? I'll take the skinny one.
There was one nice-looking one there inna black dress and beads, but she's dancing now.
I think this number is a little fast. Wait a minute.
You want me to ride down with you?
It's early.
It's Saturday night! There's still plenty-a action around!
Angie, by the time I get Clara home, it's gonna be one, one-thirty. By the time I get home, it's gonna be two o'clock. I gotta get up for ten o'clock mass tomorrow.
Where you going?
Come on over about half past seven, we'll think of something.  Hello, Ma, what's the matter?
That's nice.
That's nice. I gotta letter from my husband's cousin in Abruzzi. His mother died.
You told me.
She gave me the evil eye.
What they say?
You know what they say. They say things are no good in this house. Catherine, your son is married. Leave him in peace. He wantsa be alone with his wife. They don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I tell you what I think. I want you come live with me in my house with Marty and me. In my house, you have your own room. You don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here. We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. You are dear to me, and you are dear to Marty. We are pleased for you to come.
Marty.
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
I'm having a very good time, too.
Marty...
I'm stag.
Where you going now?
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, boy he can write.
About eight o'clock.
Sure, what?
I say, why don't you go to the Stardust Ballroom? It's loaded with tomatoes.
Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
Oh, Thomas. Ma, it's just a big dance hall, and that's all it is. I been there a hundred times. Loaded with tomatoes. Boy, you're funny, Ma.
Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?
Oh, sure.  Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her siddown.
She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?
She didn't look Italian to me.
Hey, Ang'...
Hey, Lou, gimme two bottles-a beer...
What nurses?
You still owe me ten bucks from last week, if that's what you're working up to.
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
Well...
She's right. She's right. Young husband and wife, they should have their own home. And my sister Catherine, she's my sister, but I gotta admit, she's an old goat. And plenty-a times in my life, I feel like throwing the milk bottle at her myself. And I tell you now, as far as I'm concerned, if Catherine wantsa come live here with me and Marty, it's all right with me.
I just this minute got the baby to sleep.
How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?
I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
Look at that right eye.
Not enough to be a pro.
There's only one way.
What's there to do? You found the sliver.
Duke Forrest.
Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door.
So we got to cut him fast. I figure from the X-ray it ain't just the spleen. We also got to snatch his right kidney.
And it's the ninth inning.
Any time. Whenever we want.
Plus running the opium concession for the whole Eighth Army.
No. The only thing to do is write General Hammond.  But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.
It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them.
...trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against...
You willing to b-back that up with odds?
If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
Part of him. Painless is the owner and operator of the Pride of Hamtrack. That's where he comes from... Hamtrack, Michigan.
Oh, you want to play it straight?  I guess I owe you an apology.
All of them?
On the contrary, I've observed he's not only a good technical surgeon, he's a good military surgeon. And that includes how a man dresses and how he bears himself and his sense of what it means to be an officer in the United States Army.
We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.
That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby.
A man would be more considerate. He wouldn't come home to his wife a nervous wreck.
Excuse me, Sergeant.
Yes, Reverend?
They missed the boat.
Glad to help.
The one and only.
Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
Your tent?
We don't want any more than that.  Right now.
It's the only way we can make enough to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.
Yes, that's what I mean.
I deeply regret this unfortunate incident. We try to remember we're a military organization.
Yes, dammit, and...
I'm afraid so, Colonel.
Sir?
Yes, Colonel.
In that case, here are ten basic plays. I think that's about all this bunch can handle.
Mine's already been struck, and it doesn't have to be very fancy.
Well, all those guys in the bleachers think—
Against what?
Oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you.
Uh-huh.
No, thank you.
Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.
Thirty dollars.
Thirty dollars? Well, er, what are you after? I mean, what do you want? A journalistic career?
Well, don't say anything at all. Just sit down.
Do you mean the speech you're writing?
You bet I will, Ma.
The letter.
In what man!
Sure!  When you get hold of a stunt that sells papers you don't drop it like a hot potato. Why, this is good for at least a couple of months. You know what I'd do? Between now and let's say, Christmas, when he's gonna jump, I'd run a daily yarn starting with his boyhood, his schooling, his first job!  A wide-eyed youngster facing a chaotic world. The problem of the average man, of all the John Does in the world.
Plus a bonus.
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel room—under bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him.  Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
Friend of his. They play duets together.
Well, that's fine. Now I want you to sign this agreement. It gives us an exclusive story under your name day by day from now until Christmas. On December twenty-sixth, you get one railroad ticket out of town, and the Bulletin agrees to pay to have your arm fixed. That's what you want, isn't it?
Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.
No, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
Well, nobody asked yuh.
That's—
You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
I ain't seen him for a week.
I used to pitch.
Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet.  Say, tell me something did you read that speech you're gonna make tonight?
Who are they?
Yeh. Er, and my boss, Mr. Schwabacker made a job in his warehouse for old man Delaney—
Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
Well?
There! You see? He admits it! You're a fake, John Doe! And for what you've done to all these good people—they ought to run you out of the country—and I hope they do it!
Did you want to see her about something important?
Uh-huh.
How?
Yeah.
What are you doing? Get Connell at the Bulletin !  Why, he's liable to go right past my window,  What was that?!
Out the window! Something just flew by!
I didn't see anything.
He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
Not that we know of.
I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now.
You're gettin' the car.
You want a convertible or hardtop?
Automatic.
Being faxed over now.
Spread it out.
Yeah.
I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.
I don't really like to drink.
Why? You like my ass?
Do you really?
Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.
Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit.
Yes.
You're a compulsive gambler?
I do.
You're right. I'll never be as good a liar as you.
To run late!
Damnit!
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
Then we better get moving... But there's no way we can get the jewels out of evidence.
Stay put.
Only that floor.
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
Who cares what you think. I want you back and that's all that matters.
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
You got a bet on the game tonight?
Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
...Let me just show you.
Do it!
You've changed you know. I don't think there's anything you can't do once you put your mind to it.
First you want me to put on one of those skinny ass bathing suits -- tongs or thongs or whatever you call them -- with my butt cheeks wrapped around a piece of dental floss... No way.
Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...
There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
Come on!
What do you want?
Why --
No, not me, I've been lucky.  But I've seen what happens to other people --
I'm serious, how did you know my name?
You are not a God.
It's not real.
Not real?
And all dreams, no matter how appealing, must eventually end.
Me?  Of course not.  That's why you're here.
-- He will.
We're going to have to reconfigure.
Take care?  Where the hell are you going --
Of course the legend would like to think that.  But no one has keys.  Your maze was run.
Go!
Of course they are.  Christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on.
-- Christoph changed the maze.
The Terrace.  First building Christoph ever programmed for us.
That's right.
Tanner.
Who are you?!
-- The inside?
Sorry?!
Tanner-eighteen-six-two-nine.
-- Transmit now!
Male.
Resurrection.
Uplink selected.
IMPACT IN EIGHT SECONDS!
The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being...
Stylin'!
To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
We can take these guys!
Listen, we appreciate your hospitality, but we really don't have much time.
WE'RE OUTTA HERE!
Be the swallow.  Be the swallow...
We could smell it's breath.
SECOND COUSIN, THREE TIMES REMOVED.  NOW  GET OFF ME!
How dare you?!  Nobody shuts up Rita but me!
Maybe. But he'd still be the Boss.
The goddamned bastards.
Hey, I ignore my wife too. But on our honeymoon I paid attention.
Not another word.
Whatever you say, Boss.
We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.
Tommy Reina's hauntin' his dreams. But he'll do his job.
Ya mean we're so rich we're broke?
Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.
I was calling yesterday.
It's too late.
Ya never tell a guy about a broad.
I'm very sorry... I didn't...
It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
No. We ain't even...
It's not myself I'm worried about.
I'll do fine.
They don't give a shit about us!
Why's it gotta be Tommy!
Why should I go against you, Boss? Nobody can handle this business like you. Maranzano'll never know the crap that you forget. He's got no business bein' Boss. The idea makes me wanna puke. You're the Boss, an it's gonna stay that way.
But that's an hour's drive.
I don't fuck my partners.
They do what I tell 'em.
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
We can't sell out to those guys. They ain't businessmen!
Guess I'm just lucky.
Best we got.
Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food...
Olive or eyeball?
Back? You're sending me back?
Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
Honey, I have to clarify this. The thing is, Dr. Edelstein, my brother has an absolute <u>horror</u> of doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it -
And last...you remember Bill here, from the Bazoom Toy Company? He's got a little something I think you'll like.
I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
What'll it do if they pull the plug?
Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm -
Sorry, Stu. It's all part of the deal. We've got <u>big plans</u> for that body of yours!
YOU SET ME UP!!
But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want.
They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
Are you okay??
Julie?... Hey, you <u>are</u> a looker.
Grandmama's ring. The <u>engagement</u> ring. He asked me to send it to him -
Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--
Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!
I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
<i></i> I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and I'm gonna take it - with or without you.
OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here.
Oh, <u>sure</u>. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?
There's a thing here! There's a switch!
It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone?
We like to think so, yeah.
That poor boy's a crack dealer from Alphabet City.  We do not allow his kind on this block.
The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
He seemed quite taken with you.
I don't want to talk about it.
That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York.
Aaron?
What does he do?
Are you sure you got my bag in?
Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
Calendar for the day. You'll find the Senate Manual in the drawer. Anything else you want, just snap for a page.
Right up there over the Vice- President's chair--the four in the front row represent the four big news services. You've met the press bunch, haven't you?
Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they, sonny?
It was?
Never.
I'm saying I didn't sign it!
You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.
Diz, you're a swell playmate--but--. Maybe if I saw you once with your hair combed, or something--or--no, no--I don't think even that would do it--
What! Who?
Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!
Oh, you mean--Puss in Boots.
What do I play?
Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
Nothing. I'm just saying--I might be able to lie, cheat, steal--and I'd still tear into a guy I saw kicking a dog. Not that *he* is, by a long shot--
Drunks are funny--
Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith--
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
Like a mother sending her kid off to school for the first time--watchin' the little fella toddling off--in his best bib and tucker--and you sink in the middle--hoping he can stand up to the other kids--won't get his feeling hurt--and--if you could only spare him the knocks he's gotta take--  Say--who started this?
Yeah.
No.
Okay--I mean--
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
You said it!
You don't think he'd want *me* within fifty miles, do you?--after the exhibition he saw me give! Did you see his *face*--?
Freedom of the press! Mr. James Taylor blindfolding a whole State--  Wait a minute! If that's how he wants to play *I'll* get through to that bunch--I'll get plenty of words into that, State--!  Come on, Diz, get that stuff you've written--let me have it--
No wonder--without your dinner.
All right, why?
Oh! Go away.
Listen--the simpleton of all time--a big-eyed patriot--knows Washington and Lincoln by heart--stood at attention in the Governor's presence-- collects stray boys and cats--
Henry Hill.
Me! Jim--how--?
--And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I--
Just get one hand against each ear there--keep his face straight up.
I said, sir--in my official capacity-- as an honorary gesture--I appoint you to the United States Senate!
Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
For a question!
Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on...
That's all right, my boy--don't bother--
Ah, now, that's better.
No, Jeff--please--!
How's Amos, Ma?
We'd better see.
Oh, no--no!  My dear *Senator*--it may be customary out on the prairie to take French leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours--
Did you say--bus?
One of those sightseers--you know. You see, I--gosh, I've never been called absent-minded or... but there it was all of a sudden--looking right at me through one of the station doors--
The Dome--the Capitol Dome--
You *couldn't*?
Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
What?
But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes!
No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
It hasn't been easy, has it?
I never met anyone more--more intelligent--or capable. I--I don't know where I'd be on this bill of mine without your help--
Terrible, thank you.
Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along.  YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name?
Well, if it's all the same to you--
Abigail.
No!
I've got more. You better tell me.
Must have been tickled pink.
No! Letters. I've got to write to the Rangers and Ma--and--I'm bustin' with news! Why, I've introduced a bill! Me--Jeff Smith. I got up and talked in the Senate! 
I mean it. I--without you, I could't've--
I--I don't know. I--I'm afraid they've got me licked.
Oh--Saunders--
A camp! Well!
Fine--they're fine.  Oh, Miss Paine, I--I want to apologize-- what the papers said I said about you--that wasn't true. I--I would never say a thing like that.
Uh--that's good. And--uh--you?
Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week.
How's that, buddy?
What do you mean? What's going on?
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
Jeff--meet Mr. Cook and Mr. Griffith-- members of our State headquarters here.
I've got 'im, Joe. Be right along.
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
Yes. Good morning, Saunders.  Have you--uh--any idea how this happened?
I meant it for one. I meant--Sam Foley couldn't get along without you-- and neither can I at the moment--
Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
I thought I could, too.  *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--!  Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--
It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
I know, but is it worth the risk of a scandal now that a new man is going to the Senate?
Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now, haven't they?
Oh, I see. Out steamroller methods are getting too hard to your sensitive soul, is that it, Joe? The Silver Knight is getting to big for us. My methods have been all right for the past twenty years, Joe, since I picked you out of a fly-specked hole in the wall and blew you up to look like a Senator, and now you can't stand it. Well, maybe you won't have to stand it, Joe. Maybe we can fix it so you and your Boy Ranger can go home together.
I'm glad to see you come to your senses. You had me scared there for a minute, thought.  Let him in.
Maybe he won't get up.
I don't care to meet anybody until I get paid--come on--come on. One dollar each, please, for the Milk Fund.
All right, we'll take Jeff with us--
Yes.
Never can tell what he's going to do.
Thank you very much.
You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
Why not?
No! I resigned last week!
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
What?
I enjoy it.
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
What are they going to do?
That depends on what they see.
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
Why don't you try?
The drums. He taught me to play some.
He did?
Sure!
Let's just walk, okay?
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
Oh, an imaginary one. I used to hike a lot through the woods and I'd always take this girl with me so I could talk to her. I'd show her my pet trees and things. Sounds kind of silly but we had a lot of fun doing it.
Don't be ridiculous.
Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.
He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks.  Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
Leave four columns open on the front page tomorrow.
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
Right.
Babe ought to get him drunk again.
Just one little drink - and then we're ready to shoot.
Yes, sir.
Oh, yes sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes! Yes! Let's get on with it.
I'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down.
Oh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it?
I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates.
How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.
Is Mr. Deeds in?
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
Some other time, Cobb. Some other time.
What do I care about Arthur! Did you see this stuff in the paper? How'd it get in there? What'd you do last night? Who were you talking to?
Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you.
Yes, I guess I'll have to.
Why not?
Ja.
What kind of wife did you say she was?
You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
Why, I turned them down, naturally.
Mr. Morrow, over there, for instance, just dashes them off.
Well, I play the tuba.
Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
That's all right. I got it off my chest.
You gentlemen going to stay for lunch?
I'm kind of nervous. I've never been away from Mandrake Falls in my life. Kind of like to see Grant's Tomb, though.
Yes, sir.
Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!
Imagine that - holding the ends of my pants!
Excuse me. What did you say?
Yes, sir.
But how'll I put on the slipper, sir?
Me, sir?
Yes, sir.
It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous.  I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.
He said he wasn't coming back. He said it wasn't working for him any more. That it hadn't "worked for him" for quite a while... You know what I regret the most? I'm sorry I let him make the kids take his name. He was an acquirer.  He liked to acquire things.
Of course... I've heard great things about you.
Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm sorry to hear that.
Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you --
What?!
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
Mr. Gilroy --
I've had my moments.
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
We've been talking about her, mostly.
I do.
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
Doc.  Ainge...
Okay.
You're right, as usual. See you.
Do you think that's a good idea?
Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
Just who is here, can you tell me?
Could I see Sofie, please?
No.
What?
Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
It doesn't matter. Go on.
And he's where?
That's one way to put it.
Of course.
What was that?
You probably got the idea.
You're not the only one...
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
What?
Of course... I haven't got the energy to get out of town that fast.
In maybe three or four issues.
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
Have women found you attractive?
Just chill for a second. Look at this guy, it appears he's actually dead... but gorgeous.
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
What happened today?
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
Nah... scotch.
I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?
You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think.
Well, you know... that's the thing. Like I said, just about everybody in town works for me. And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. It's like an order or something... And no one -- no one -- asks me.
Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.
Did you know that Danny Ainge was drafted by the Blue Jays? Do you know what kind of athlete you have to be to play in the NBA and in the bigs?
Uh-huh.
Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything?
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
It's time you did some talkin', Dr. Mum -- Wait a minute. That is your name, isn't it?
I can tell you anything else.
Everybody has a story, Skip.
Hey, you've done good. Look at yourself... you've cleaned up, you've got a career --
Harder than I thought. Took me three tries. But I was highly motivated -- figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along. After two bomb-outs, I found a place in the desert...
That'd be Lily.
"Mumford"... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?
You want my advice? Far out!
Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?
Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.
Priests. Imhotep's priests.
Well, okay then.
You're not going to kill us?
Oh yes, of course.
And then killing your sister.
In the desert? What for?
Who needs smart women? I put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this mess!
Try me.
-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for nothin'.
Fifty percent.
Want to know?
Twenty-five percent, and not one single farthing more.
Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to the underworld", actually.
Okay, I get your father, I get your mother and I get your brother, but what are you doing here?
Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.
The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues.
It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book.
I'm staying.
Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them.
Shut-up and get me off of here!
And you're sure you can find the secret compartment?
What are you going to do? Shoot him?
Of course.
And what's that?
What --?
Your mind is so slippery.
Head hunting.
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
Really?
Half a Dirty Dozen!
Sure.
How's your dad?
Have you always lived here?
What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
I say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!
Yeah.
I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure.
Or flowers.
But we don't know for sure it's the same guy.
Then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood... a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of the night!
Come on.
We're superheroes.
Really? Like Captain Amazing?
Looking for... the TV Guide.
I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.
Right.
But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.
I can appreciate what Your Majesty is saying but the Emperor has staked everything on this policy.  He has no other way to attack England, and no one knows more than Your Majesty how his overtures for peace have been rejected.
My dear Caulaincourt, you have no idea of how compromised my own position has become since Tilsit.  I am blamed by the army for the military disaster at Austerlitz and Friedland, by the nobility for ruining their trade with England, by the merchants who must accept French foods at unprofitable prices, and by the nation for allowing Napoleon to dictate Russian policy.
Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it.
Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.
General Kutusov, I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them.  I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration.
I am at your disposal, Your Majesty.
Ah -- you approve?
Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
But who made this treaty?
What cowardice!  What treason! Joseph has ruined everything.  How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your troops around, General Belliard.
I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.
She should have had Larrey or Corvisart.  They might have saved her... But why didn't anyone even write to me?  Can you believe that no one even bothered to write to me? Would you have believed that I should read such news in a newspaper?  How incredible!
I see...
It is the work of incendiaries.
I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.
Impossible, I don't believe it.
Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me.
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
Do you have three francs, sir?
Lisette La Croix.
And you, Junot?
Are you trying to insult me?
My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
Oh... I see.  I understand.  How is... the Emperor?
Ah, that is good.
Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
And now?
But you have had mistresses while you were away.
One had better legs.
Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
But you will not... be safe...
Oh, my darling.  I'm sorry, too.  I won't do that again -- whatever you do.  I won't cause you any more embarrassment, I promise.
Certainly.
Nothing.  That's all I can say.
Yes, I wrote it.
God help me -- yes.
Yes.
Can you give me a drink, please?
I believe so.  I believe Madame Bonaparte was not discreet, in Paris.
Yes, I do -- very much.
I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
Oh, my dearest child -- you must not worry about anything.  I will teach you everything that you must know.
We have a treaty with Austria.
That is a matter of opinion.
I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot.  Do you know him, monsieur?
Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.
Send him in.
My mother has always loved me.  She would do anything for me.
It will scarcely be considered credible, perhaps, but our whole business consisted in eating cherries together.
Yeah.
Well, let me in.
Uncle Elroy, who's that girl by Day-Day's car?
I don't know!
Passed out?  Can't hang, huh?  Boy, I knew you was a lightweight.  Passed out on one funky ass blunt.  They don't make 'em like they used to, baby.
Yup.
Don't move me.
That's fuckin' poetic, Craig.
That's cron-don, sir.  My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?
Thanks, I just wish my mother had a chance to see it.
I can't taste nothing.
I didn't see nothing.
How you know?  It could be anything.
You go first.
Hell yeah, I remember you.
Easier said than done.  We saved up to get away from them, but they followed us.
So what?  Let's make'em wait.
Hurry up; today is Fri-day!  And we gotta hit the high-way!
I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up!
All damn.
Nice to meet you?
It's a long story.  Right now we gotta do somethin'.
Yoooo, that's it.  You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach.
I'm not letting nothing go.  They killed my board.
Okay, later, bro.  Hey, Craig, nice smokin' wit'cha.
Alright, no problem.  We gone.
Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on that.
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
Take your car.
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
I got my mase.
I slip my disc, again... Oh got damn.
I threw my back, again.
But I want to make some changes. Get Krista in here right away won't you?
Sorry.
One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
That's...a comfort to hear.
It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.
I would also like to apologize.
Same to you.
What about the gun?
That's not my problem, Mr. Watson
You know what I'm gonna do.
Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara Grant.
Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me.
I don't see how they could be in on it. They're the best. They're hand- picked.
You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me.
But...
Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
No way.
How did you see us kiss?
He's doing it for you. No matter what anybody tells you, no matter who they are, he's doing it for you, because he loves you.
No...kisses to you.
I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
That's right.
No way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
Yeah, all right, listen...
Don't think I won't.
It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
I don't think so.
I see. Where is this gun?
It goes in that little hole.
You're a big girl, huh?
How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
Listen to me John.
Yes, Dad.
Pshaw now! Ain't it a caution what women'll load onto a feller's back when he ain't lookin'?
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
When'll the skiff be ready?
Well goodnight, boy. Come again -- any time.
Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.
Hide us Uncle Birdie! He's a-comin' with his knife!
John: you go fetch Ruby.  Big Ruby's my problem girl. She can't gather eggs without bustin' 'em; but Ruby's got mother hands with a youngin, so what're you to say?
You have all sinned!
Yes! Yes! Hallelujah!
IN THE RIIV-ER!
Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
A man of the Cloth?
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
And he killed every last one of 'em!
Come on!
How?
I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
Blue men.
Sshhh...
No, that's just it. No.
He ain't my Dad.
I don't know nothin'!
Don't you believe me?
Naturally.
Because John said I mustn't.
Can I have this?
No. No one never did.
Yes; from the first night.
Oh, I'm sorry, Harry! I didn't know! I thought maybe --
Answer me!
My flesh and blood!
Where's your Missus?
Where's she at?
She took them kids with her?
None of your business, Madam.
The man! The man!
Thank God.
Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
Slept like a rock.
Okay, okay.  I think.
I heard your ma went ape at the security store today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long's it been since you slept?
Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.  Listen, I... I know who he is.
How you plan to do that?
What!?
What?
Just want to talk to him a second.
And you'll be here to catch him, right?
I don't mean her --
'Anything funny' like what?
Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know?
To bed with you, c'mon.
I threw that filthy thing away -- I don't know what you're trying to prove with it, but --
Yeah, nuts.
Ninotchka, you know I am your friend, you can trust me.... Did you bring back anything else?
Tell me... what else did you have?
Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
You want this?
...des raisins de Madère, des framboises... 
And they might believe her in Moscow.
No, no.
Huh?... Why don't you get a haircut, Buljanoff? You all look so wintry, Comrades. And why do we always keep the windows closed?  Isn't it amazing, at home there's still snow and ice and here... Look at the birds. I always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries. Now I know why. We have the high ideal but they have the climate... well, Comrades, I don't think I need you any more.
Friends... friends, Buljanoff, Iranoff...
The Duchess...
The former Duchess!
Well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you.
Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
Emphatically not, sir. The prospect terrifies me. Now, don't misunderstand me, sir, I don't resent your not paying me for the past two months, but the thought that I should split my bank account with you... that you should take half of my life's savings... that is really too much for me.
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
Are they indeed? Thank you.
That's perfect!
Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case.
It is Thursday!
If you close your eyes and listen to our voices we might be in Paris.
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
Comrade.
Comrade.
What a charming idea for Moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade.
A cow?
You've done it again and I am responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here to make money, not to spend it.
Just looking around.
Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
Yes... a very slim one. I want to be fair. I don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case.
You, Comrade Iranoff, go to the Public Library and get me the section of the Civil Code on property.
Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you.
What can I do about it?
She has been asked to leave the powder room but without success. We would appreciate if you would see to it yourself.
You want me to go in there?
I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist.
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
Technical... I couldn't help you from that angle. You see, a real Parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off.
And where are we?
I don't have to but I find it natural.
Do not misunderstand me. I do not hold your frivolity against you.  As basic material you might not be bad, but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel sorry for you.
Please don't misunderstand me...
Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
Thank you.
I'd love to.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.
But my dear child, I am most at home among working men. I hate the places where you circulate -- the Hotel Clarence... This is my natural element. After all, what are any of us? Workingmen! At least, those of us who are worth our salt. Hyah?
At what?
Then you should go back to your table.
I wish they had never met.
No.
Yes.
That's when one half of Paris says to the other half, "What are your plans for this evening, madame?"
I promise... I swear.
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
Yes. Don't worry. Everything will be all right.
Comrades! Good people of France!
I love you, my little Leonitchka!
I know... it's the Russian soul.
Oh yes, yes. It has a little knob that turns... a little knob... it must be somewhere around here... yes... here... I see...
Well, it has to warm up... you have to give it a chance... just like people... like you and me... first you wanted to fight me and now we belong to the same party... salute!
Czar Peter gave it to his wife, Catherine the Great. For it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market.
Good morning, Swana.
Darling, I was busy looking out for your interests.
Oh, Leon, you are so good to me. 
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"!
Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past!
I understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. They are willing to pay any price! They have a circulation of two million!
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
Darling, you're taking my business affairs far too seriously. Much as I'd love to rob the Bolsheviks of their filthy money, I won't do it at the expense of your health. Particularly as we know we won't get much.  You look so pale... pale but interesting.
You just told me you hadn't seen her.
Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.
You saw all that in one glimpse?
Yes, Swana, you did.
I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.
It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I'm in love, Swana.
Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little château in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.
What?
I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
Believe me, Leon can't help you. He doesn't know anything about the jewels... I give you my word... I swear it.
You leave me no choice.
I haven't either, but I've heard about them. You must realize it was only on the strength of your Paris report that I sent them to Constantinople; without that I never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal.
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
Then what about this Washington Post crap?  Woodwind and Fernstein?
No, we have nothing to hide.
I'll bet he would.
John, sooner or later -- sooner, I think -- you are going to learn the lesson that has been learned by everyone who has ever gotten close to Richard Nixon.  That he's the darkness reaching out for the darkness.  And eventually, it's either you or him. Look at the landscape of his life and you'll see a boneyard.
Anyway, they had to take her to Bellevue.  Maybe she'll stay this time.
It's the fall of the Roman Empire, are you blind?  And we're putting fig leaves on the statues ...
Mitchell's out of his mind now. Martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.
I will not go down as the first American president to lose a war! Going into Cambodia, bombing Hanoi, bombing Laos -- it buys us time so we can get out and give the South Vietnamese a fighting chance.
Sir, there's dead American kids here. Let's say we don't apologize for Kent State, but maybe we could have a national prayer day ...
No, no.  He's our only "star" right now.  He'd go crying straight to the press.  He'd crucify us -- the sonofabitch!  Get someone from our staff on his ass. Tap his phones.  I want to know everyone he talks to.
And what am I supposed to do?  Just sit here and watch them coming closer? Eating their way to the center?  Lyndon bugged!  So did Kennedy!  FDR cut a deal with Lucky Luciano. Christ, even Ike had a mistress! What's so special about me?  What about Lyndon?  He could make a couple of calls to the Hill and shut this whole thing down.  Did anyone talk to him?
No, you're not!  You're going to claim executive privilege and you're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the Fifth Amendment.  I don't give a shit.  They can't force the President's people to testify.
Mr. Hoover was a realist.
Cox!  Fire him.
Can we get around this, Al?
How do you see this?
I know it well, sir.
The Bay of Pigs? ... That was Kennedy's screw-up.  How does that threaten us?
Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
Sir?
Yeah, but Roselli wasn't just any gangster.  He was the gangster who set up Track 2 in Cuba.
So?  You wanted Castro dead. Everybody wanted Castro dead.  If Hunt and the others are CIA, why don't we just throw this back in the CIA's lap? Let Richard Helms take the fall?
Because he didn't even know about it. The CIA never told him, they just kept it going.  It was like ... it had a life of its own.  Like ... a kind of "beast" that doesn't even know it exists.  It just eats people when it doesn't need 'em anymore.  Two days after the Bay of Pigs, Kennedy called me in.  He reamed my ass ...
Sir?
Don't forget the South, sir, the West. Filled with the good football colleges, straight kids.  There's more of 'em with you than against you.  Not like these mudmutts.
Don't let it lose us the right-wing vote ...
I believe you're right, boss.
When I met with him, he said ...
Then this shall be our little secret.  Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees.  Thou may fool the world. Even thy father.  But not me, Richard. Never me.
I said I didn't need a free ride.  I need a suit.
You're not gonna quit on me, are you, Harold?
Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...
I'm interested in the documents that put your people together with ... the others.  All of them ...
The President would support a reasonable request for an increase.
It will take a little time, but I'll order a search for your papers. Though it does raise a disturbing issue.
Mr. Castro.
My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
Not Joaquin, you idiot.  Nixon.  Did you hear what he said in Oregon? About me having too much power.
Turn this crap off, Clyde.  It's giving me a headache ... You may go, Joaquin.
I always get my man.
Dick, these boys want you to run.  They're serious.  They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column.  That would've done it in '60.
He's turned into a drug fiend, he shot people from helicopters in Vietnam, he has sexual relations with his wife in front of their children.  He sees a shrink in L.A.  He's all fucked up. Now he's trying to be a hero to the liberals ... If he gets away with it, everybody will follow his lead.  He must be stopped at all costs.
This is a major coup, gentlemen -- our own State Department doesn't even know.  And if it leaks out of here tonight ...
Do you ever pray?  You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
How a fat man gets so many girls.
Of course.
Why?
I don't know.  He made me see the stars ...
We know you've taken a great risk in inviting us here.
We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.
How about Kissinger along with him?
Hiss was protecting his wife.  I've always believed that.
Jesus Christ!
One of the fathers was on the TV saying, "My child was not a bum."  And it's playing like gangbusters.  Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph.
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
She must be very attractive.  Would she like an autograph?  She might remember me ... Where's Trini?
Tell 'em what you like; they'll never understand it anyway.
Who the fuck are they?  Bob, are you working on revoking the Posts's television license?  Good.
Compassionate.  Grateful.
Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
It's over, Dick.
My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
Are you serious?
They love you, Buddy.  They need you, too.
Can I just ask for one thing?
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.
I do.  I do.  In my own way.
But they never will, Dick.  No matter how many elections you win, they never will.
Don't be ridiculous!
Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it.  I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court.
Write.  You know, a book.  I'm calling it "Six Crises."  It's a good thing, Rocky -- take some time off to write.
Whatcha mean by that?
Some say you are, Rocky.
What give you that idea. I seen one of the cats heard it.
Got a letter from your wife. She writes pretty regular, tells me the family news.
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
Yes, you've circled round.
You don't know what he thinks.
Yes I do.
When did he die?
Yes.
It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
You ain't heard from him?
Uh-huh.
You sure?
Llewelyn Moss?
Well, Wendell, with all due respect, that don't make a whole lot of sense.
Well then I guess I can skip it. Heavens to Betsy, Wendell, you already put me off my breakfast.
Yessir. It was punched out.
Okay.
No, that's the only thing I would've looked for. And it sounds like these boys died of natural causes.
Natural to the line of work they was in.
That's very nice.
Well they always is to the party concerned.
Three years ago I said them very words. No and Good.
I ain't got the money.
I wouldn't worry about it.
You gave your word?
At the gettin' place.
I need to know that.
What're you doin', baby?
Somethin' I forgot to do. I'll be back.
I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.
I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.
What should I do?
What did you tell him?
What did I know to tell him. You're hurt, ain't you?
She'll be all right?
I need dark. To get it. I know where it is.
You go to hell.
Step out of the car please, sir.
Why would I care where you're going.
Yeah? Where am I?
You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going?
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
Didn't mean nothin'.
You married into it.
You married into it.
...If that's the way you wanna put it.
Call it?
Well -- we need to know what it is we're callin' for here.
Everything.
How's that?
Uh-huh. Double ought.
The kind with the most poles.
Okay.
Let's just call it square.
November the 28th, last year.
Well enough.
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
I know, I've seen him. Sort of.
I know how he found me.
Not any way.
I didn't say braze.
So was I.
To kill your wife.
He don't talk as much as you, I give him points for that.
Don't jack with me.
Could I have that in American?
Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
Mind your own business. You just said that shit so you could look at her a little longer, anyway...
I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was...
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
Yeah?
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
So you're saying Betty Sizemore -- our Betty Sizemore -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You're amazing.
You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
One question, Doctor, please!  You can't do this! I'm the press, I have rights!!
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?
No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
Sure. You could probably have any thing you wanted... somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself, and you don't even realize it.
Wait. Let me get this out.  I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
No one is, honey. Here, listen to this... "If who I am and who I hope to be should meet one day, I know they will be friends." Now that's beautiful.
I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
No... what about your sister?
I gotta go make dinner.
Are you and Larry happy?
I gotta go.
Oh, David... I'm sorry I caused you that much pain.
She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
George...
I ran back in to get the phone.
Or the vitamins? Or the...?
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.
Dr. David Ravell.
Like Rome?
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
...did I win some contest?
You're hurting him!!
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
So why'd you come to L.A.?
Man, that is love.
Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.'
How many men have I talked to?
I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.
No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
Yes, I had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right there...
I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
No, you're not. You're a good doctor, Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell. I've made my decision. Now, if you'll excuse me...
Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken.
I... I don't know...
My socks?
Hell of a way to die.
It wasn't always fatal, Wesley. We could scalp Del right now, and he'd be plenty alive to tell us how it feels.
I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.
Joyce was screwing Del.
I dunno... something.  Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
It's a very moving experience, trust me.
No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
I'm not telling 'til you straighten up. You been acting like fucking Jerry Lewis on me and this shit's gotta stop or you can forget about your Betty... I mean it.
Wesley...
"It's beneath her..." She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!
A doctor on the show... why?
She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her...
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
Man, you have got to get some therapy.
...yeah, I got it.  Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
You made your point...  I was wrong.
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
Yeah? The sport utility?
Uh-huh.
Oh, there's no tellin' what that girl could've accomplished, and she never had it easy. Never really had a childhood... caring for her father, going to school.
No... before that.
Did Chloe crack?
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
You can't do this - we just been pardoned!  By the Governer himself!
Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
Wipin' little circles with his bread.
Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.
Don't I know it.
Pete, the personal rancor reflected in that remark I don't intend to dignify with comment, but I would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism. Consider the lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- take a look at Delmar here as your paradigm a hope.
It was a powerful air.
Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!
He ain't our daddy!
Blooey!
Stop calling me 'sir! I ain't no officer. My name is Byron.
Who gave you this idea?
Great ass.
Naw. That's over with.
Don't lose any sleep over it. I wouldn't mind being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat.
Great. You can go in my place.
The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
Well, goodbye.
No.
No, sir.
Stop whispering, Sweet Pea, you're giving me a hard on!
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
But you knew right off what I was talking about, didn't you, Paula! Did you let that boy --
Yes, ma'am. Four long, hard weeks of sacrifice for my country... for my people... for you. But I survived.
Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
Sid, there's no baby.
What?
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
He'll show. I'd bet my paycheck on it.
Really?
No. I work for National Paper. It's a good job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour.  When I get enough money saved, I plan to go on to college.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
Be a friend. Leave.
Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that.
Does it still hurt?
No. Is that what you want?
Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
No wonder he was looking at me like that.
It's grown out more than an inch, sweetheart.
She'll come, pard. A rich socialite Oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts.
Listen, I'm not going to go to that little reunion party. I'm meeting Lynette at the motel.  Best head in fifty-two states. After three days of survival training, how could I resist?
But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived.
The fuck did you do that for?!
Fuckin' asshole, thinks he knows me. Drives his German car up to 125th Street a couple of times, buys a few rounds, thinks he's a tough guy, thinks he knows me.  You don't know one thing about me!
Burning me.  It's burning my eye.
Th --
Yeah.  She can.  She's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. You rest, Kid.  Half an hour.
Are you gonna open the safe?
You finish.  Then we finish.
Get the fuck away from me.
The kid in here.  The other two when we come out.
You're an idiot.
So we keep an eye on her.  Raoul can totally administrate that part.
Yeah.  Kidnapping.
They're gonna die in there!
Everything okay?
What do you want?
Evan, I am so sorry, you were a saint to wait for us!
It's just the woman and the kid?
I'm just saying, the man is a problem.  And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
Well, I know that now.
That room!
Wait.
Say fuck.
Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
Not in the bedroom.  Do it!
Close it!
Uh uh.
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three..."
He won't even know who it was.
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
What do you mean? We're black ain't we? And we care about improving the plight of out people don't we? Or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs!
I have confirmed to you my address, that's all I'm required to by law to do. We have broken no law.
Well as the Rev says, God helps those who help themselves.  We'll be our own stoplight.
Yeah, I do, but he's gotta cool it...
What's up?
Shit man. It was... you know spontaneous.
Drugs Judge, they're gonna flood West Oakland with dope. Jack you up and string you out like a two dollar whore. And while the community's shuffling for a fix, they're gonna snuff every Panther they can find.
Well don't go forgetting your friends.
Can't... they're having a PE meeting at Headquarters tonight, come on down. Check it out.
No man. PE -- "political education."
Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.
That would be an excellent start.  Tell him to keep a low profile.
They couldn't have thought this up for themselves.
Jesus...
Yes sir, I did.
Well... like they say, there's a Panther born every minute in the ghetto. Uh... we seem to have "underestimated" the support of the Black community. It's their power base...
You mean...
The white power structure wants us to act like savages.  But we're a different kind of animal altogether. We're Panthers. And The Black Panther Party for Self Defense is very painfully aware that America has historically reserved its most barbaric treatment for non-white people since the beginning of the country. So we need to organize, we  keep our shit correct! And effect revolution. We revolve the power into the hands of the people. Where it belongs.  Power to the people baby...
Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts.  And they want us to help with security.
We need money first...
So talk...
Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to Malcolm.
I don't know.
Okay man I ain't going to push. But remember the revolution isn't going to wait for anyone. Come on, we'll give you a lift.
I'd hoped I was finished with all that. But... 
Yeah I know. You're smart Judge. You ain't no bourgeois nigger like those Paper Panthers across the bay. I need every good man to help us with the security on Betty Shabazz, particularly soldiers. You do solid on that I might have something else for you, something real important.
You fit the profile, Brother. You look exactly like the kind of nigger they think they can trust...
Chickenshits, they're grabbing at anything.
Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one, Judge? 
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
Yeah... cop hit me...
You believe that?
No.
No.
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
Trust you and Harry Lee.  Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis?
You're the worst of that sort. You're the sort that gives that sort a bad name.
Don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier.  It was a harder time and a harder place than you know.
I've done nothing and for that I am ashamed.
Colonel will do.
Oh?
That is a separate issue.
Yes, sir.
And if I triumph, you triumph.
Unless I'm dreaming, I think I see irregulars at their center.
Not yet.  What happened?
If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.
You know what happened.
That's not enough.  Tell me.
Yes, I do.  I hate him and I hope he never comes back.
Thank you.  Were I an orator, those are the exact words I would have spoken.
Nonetheless, I would like to know, Mister Marion, how... how... how...
When?
You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
Thank you.
I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.
Four, five miles.
No, there'll be skirmishers on the roads.  We're safer here.
But what about Thomas?
Earned.
Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
Bite?
Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
Yes--
He can if He wants to. He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for him, that's what I think. I've got his picture and I'm going to sit in his chair--
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair.
Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear.
And I'm going to eat his breakfast cereal, too, even though it tastes like boogers. And...and...
I'll be there in three days--four at the most. I've got to get the electricity shut off and square things with your school so the truant officer ain't after you, and--
Not at all.
What's at the end of it?
Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.
I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty.
Yes, but--
The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.
I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?
You want to rest a bit before you start?
No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call...but not a word about tonight.
Louis--
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed. Don't go on, doc. No matter how much you feel you have to. There's more power here than you know.
Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
Did you see his shirt?
And Church will be fine.
I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
That's not true. The subject scares me. Because of Zelda.
You'll get it back.  Or one better.
Mr. Gibbs, organize a cleaning detail -- you and Cotton.  I want every inch of the Pearl spic-and- span and ship-shape!
I'll torture it out of you.
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
The situation has changed.
That so?
Men!  Are you up for it?
Now.  No, don't kill him.
I guess there is a reason to fret.
Did you, now?
I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
Ceremony?
About the day we met. Do you remember?
It doesn't!
Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?
I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square.
No.  This won't work.  I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on.
The trees are taller.
Exactly.
Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.
Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants.  Something he needs.
What?  He never told me that.
That we are.
I knew you'd listen to reason!
I'll be at the wheel myself.
Move!
Somewhat.
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
Aye!  Avast!
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
On what?
This way!
Jack!
It's the right way.
No, it's not.
You haven't seen it.
Dammit, man, it appears someone is stealing your ship!
No.  The captain of the containment crew is closing down the main lab. He says the area has got to be evacuated.
I ask you what is the purpose of science?  What is the point of all our relentless exploration, investigation and experimentation? It is to understand a single physical phenomenon, or to understand them all?  To cure one disease, or to cure every disease? If science is simply a means, what then is the end?
How do you know we're not heading in the wrong direction?
Wow, that is one moving story.  Take it easy on my heart strings.  Now I really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison.
That's right.  And making me was the biggest mistake you ever made!
You're not rotting meat.
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
No, Icky, this is real.
Poppy, this is not the time!
Cleaned up?  It can't be cleaned up! Without the nanobot the waste can't be stabilized!  That's what we've been trying to tell you!  The only thing we can do is run!  Run!  Run!
That might work.
Thank you, sir.
You don't want this.
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.
That's the guy?
They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners.
Okay.
What?  No kiss?  Not even for old times sake?
Jesus, Daniel.  It wasn't Ryker's Island.  It was work camp for white collar criminals.
I've read they're using it to repair cancer cells.
I can't help it, Suze.  It's this place.  You know how I get in these stores.  They freak me out.  All these tiny boxes, little cans filled with eight syllable God knows what.
You're insane.
Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
Yes.
Then you must have at some point tried to reverse the procedure.
We don't?
Got it.
What about it!
No problem.
It's still inside me?
Something else I want to try.
I can't go back to jail.  I gotta get out of here.
What could happen?  I'm the plastic man, remember?
You mean he's polymerized, like me?
The same thing I suppose.
It's a miracle.
We lost him.
Goodbye, Stew—
Oh, thank you, I knew you'd understand.
Well, you could make this table a little - uh - a little less wide.  There is something you can do for me, Miss Schuyler.
That's because you're too far away, Stew.
Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough?  What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me!
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now—
Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters—
Oh yes you will wear garters—
Sure - my pal on the paper. She's subbing for the society editor tonight.
Yes, I'll tell you - for the same reason I've never wanted to go out with those social parasites, those sweet-smelling fashion plates. I don't like them. They bore me. They give me the jitters.
O-o-oh, I get you—  All right. All right. I don't blame you. I kinda forgot myself for a moment, there. That's what I call getting me told, isn't it, Anne?
You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
Mother!
I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.
Well, I got a seat, but I have no place to put it.
Yeah - go on.
Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
Come on, get going, get going!
I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with the tourists. So they swam over.
A what?
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
What are you doing fooling around in here?
Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
Come on, come on. Here they come, Gallagher! Here they come!
I hope not . . . I've got to call on her this morning!
Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.
Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
Well!
Well, you're my pal, aren't you? Then don't turn female on me.
It's the smoke.
My error.
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me.  Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler?  I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky!  Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?
Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around.  Gilded cage?!  Besides, I'm not marrying her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha!  That mug. What does he know?
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
Must be my wife.
Right!
What do you know about Conrad?
Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
Here you are.
All right, thanks. Now, let's see. How will I start? Hey pal, how would you start?
Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.  Now what are you crying about?
Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
Hello, Joe.
The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
The name is Smythe.
Thanks.
And they won't be able to tell?
Sure.
... It's a pretty short trip.
Bud brought it to me.
Here's my favorite.
It's fine. You'll put on some make up and ...
I don't want to put on some make up ...
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...
Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke.
Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
No. Of course not.
It was accessible to everyone.
Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either.
But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
What is it?
Green.
The one in your mind. The one that you see on a bright cold morning. The one that you see when you walk in front of your house and you just stand there and stare.
We're supposed to be at home David! We're supposed to be in color!  Oh God ...
Just watch. You know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing burns around here, that's why! They don't need any firemen ...
Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.
It's fine.
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
Wow.
Yes.
I told you. I'm like positive.
I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
Oh yeah. There's a lot of stuff. Currants and strawberries ... Here. I'll show you.
A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?
Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...
What do I MEAN!  You think this is a toy? You think it's your own little goddamn coloring book ...
Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous.  Sleep well.
Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!
... What's that?
Christmastime.
I brought you something ... From the library.
Yeah. TV busted?
Yeah ...
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.
Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
I don't know.
It's fine, but --
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?
......she forgot her purse at my work and I wanted to get it back to her.
I....please don't do this.
No.
Sure.
Are your pants off?
What do you mean it doesn't matter?
It doesn't matter.
Does Jack like to Jack Off?
...yeah....well you have me now.
I do pretty good, I think. I wish I was making more, doing a little bit better. I can,t get over a certain hump. I will...I will crack something soon I think and really do better...I'd like to diversify...but I'm doing great, I think, as a start.
No.
Ok. SEXY VOICE Yeah...that's it...God I Am So Horny...I wish I was there to help you.....I wish I was there for you, Barry.
I'm fine. Who is this?
It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?
I didn't lie.
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
I have to go.
I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
Do you have brothers or sisters?
I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --
-- well, if you're gonna go --
Sure.
Yeah.
Yeah.
....No....
Yes I'm fine. Everything is ok. It's fine. Everything is fine.
Yes no not really.
Ok. Have a good trip.
I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
Yeah.
I don't freak out very often.
Yes.
OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing?
Where you married?
I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....
For what?
I'm fine are you ok?
You can't do that.
So here we go.
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
I don't know.
Alright, well you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to go.
......and this is confidential?
What do you mean?
Barry Egan.
You want her to call you Jack?
What?
You came all the way from Los Angeles to tell me that?
That was weird. I meant good.
I wanted to ask you because you're a doctor, right?
My name is Barry Egan and I spoke to you....you called me, you remember?
I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.
What's with all this pudding, what is this?
That's funny.
Nothing....I mean, really...change, nothing....that's the cash I have....
What are you doing?
You can't be late though.
I want you to go right away, I think that's best. I also need you to check out a car for me down there that this guy is selling.
Put him through.
No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --
Yeah.
Ok.
I think he's weird, but that's me.
I'll just see you when you get back here.
We've still a few lone incurables. Prone to violence, to perversion.
We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
Not now, or we're both done for.
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching.
There I was taxed; it's true.
I write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! The whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die.
Don't be absurd; it's only a play.
You always do.
You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw.
Valcour. His chair.
A man after my own heart...
Your words drove Bouchon to --
Yes?
Oh indeed?
What could cause a tincture like this?
Of course, Your Highness. Nevertheless... cure the Marquis de Sade... succeed, where countless physicians and priests have failed...
Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
Tortures so arcane, so medieval, even I haven't the words to describe them. If you've an ounce of pity in your heart, you'll throw caution aside, and unlock my door...
Go on, child.
With all due respect, Madame, all France is familiar with your husband.  Grant us a moment alone, won't you, Monsieur Prouix?
But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?
Oh, but I am!
I can say, with the utmost sincerity, that every franc you've given me has been put to sterling use.
Am I a cursed woman, Doctor? Must I be betrayed by every man I meet --
....shame on you, truly...
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
Very much.
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
She's a Catholic. She says it would put her soul in peril. Divorce is a very serious sin, apparently.
You oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president, after all.
This picture--
I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
Not for me.
You will not walk out on me
You are repellant when you drink.
There is nothing to understand but this:   I am a man who could have been great, but was not.
I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in Hollywood, do I not? If you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me.
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
And how do you feel when you are lied to?
Huh?
Good God no! The character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons--
No -- no -- I mean--
Oh for God's sake, Louella-
All right! Enough! I've heard this from Schaefer and RKO. I've heard it from everyone--
No, it's perfect! When in doubt, put on a cape! False noses and faux beards and flowing capes have been the life-blood of the actor's craft since the days of lrving and Booth.  Imagine me in a glittering suit of lights on the dusky Andalusian plains--
Don't whisper it. Don't even think it
It doesn't have to be
I don't care.
Jews. She's talking about Jews.
What does this have to do with--?
I told you this was going to happen! I told you he was going to come after us! So we took the chance anyway and we lost. That's how it goes, okay? I got my check, kid, and so did you -- and that's what it's all about -- so fuck it and move on.
Oh God.
Thank you-
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
Very generous
Well it' s all you've got !
Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
Hold on a sec. I got news. We finally found somewhere to premiere KANE but--
About what?
No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.
I don't follow no gamblin' Commissioner. I'm just a fighter.
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
You know?
Jack! Enough!
Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?
You wasn't with her, were you?
No, take her home. I wanna be alone for a while. Everybody go.
Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
Yeah, I know.
All right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. So, you enjoy the suspension. 'Cause there's nothin' you can do about it. Let the Commissioner and the D.A. jerk you around. So you wait.
We did what we had to do. Tommy don't forget. Sooner or later you'll get your shot -- if Tommy don't die.
Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth.
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie?
I did keep an eye...
What?
Did you ever fuck my wife?
Whadda ya mean?
Ya hear, Joey? She thinks this face is cute? Hey, whatcha doin' now? You wanna go for a ride?
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
You're not interested in him?
Huh?
You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
"Father of the Bride."
Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
OK. Talk.
I'm leaving you Jake.
All right, just don't make any noise.
I need ten thousand dollars. My lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped.
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
I'd tell you to bet a bundle.
Look, I'm just tellin' you how Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard on himself. Tommy wants him with us. It's as simple as that.
What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
Jefferies?
Get that idea out of your mind. It will only lead you in the wrong direction.
Didn't you take it to the crime lab?
Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.
I'll bet it's been done.
What time?
I can't do that.
Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear.
Yeah -- frequently -- it ran something like this: "Your request for transfer turned down --"
Your logic is backward.
Your Lisa?
I told you that --
I know what you told me! She went in to get evidence, and she came out with it.
A possibility.
Where'd they take Lisa?
For what?
For getting rid of that cast.
With that cast on -- you don't.
So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.
You've got to get me out of here! Six weeks -- sitting in a two-room apartment with nothing to do but look out the window at the neighbors!
It's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.
Next time, have some good news.
Yeah.
That's abnormal.
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say.
No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
And digging in.  Look at that flower bed.
Smart? She'll be arrested!
First offense burglary --  -- probably two-fifty.  The piggy bank.
When those cops get a look at Miss Fremont -- they'll even contribute.
Uh-huh.
We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
It's just a run-of-the-mill Monday. The calendar's loaded with them.
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
Not a bit. I was all morning in a sales meeting. Then over to the Waldorf for a quick drink with Madame Dufresne -- just over from Paris. With some spy reports. Back to the "21" for lunch with the Harper's Bazaar people -- that's when I ordered dinner. Then two Fall showings -- twenty blocks apart. Then I had to have a cocktail with Leland and Slim Hayward -- we're trying to get his next show.  Then I had to dash back and change.
I wish there was one I wanted.
You said it resembled my apartment, didn't you?
If anything, I'm making it sound good.  Let's face it, Lisa... you aren't made for that kind of a life. Few people are.
Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.
Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him.
Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
You'd better before you catch the disease!
A lot of things. She's an invalid who needs constant care -- and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day.
To get on home.
What about it?
They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.
Still -- those witnesses.
Don't rush me. We have all night.
No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.
Well, -- if there was one less thread this way --  -- and two less that way --  -- I might give up bachelorhood.
How?
Friend of yours?
Give me some dirt.
Good luck, Buzz.
Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
How'd he get in?
I think I should go home.
No.
You don't?
Sure.  Sure.
I was talking to Jim.
Stay here.  That was my son!
Yes, sir.
Plato.
No, sir.  I just went next door to look at them like I always do. They were nursing on their mother and I did it.  I guess I'm just no good?
What do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?
What's the charge?
Why don't you come back tomorrow, son?  Ever been booked before?
I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  Do you think it never stops?
Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many--people I can talk to.
Yeah?
Come out come out wherever you are!
Not lately.
Plato!
They like you.  Okay?
Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?
Goodbye, dear.
Mom--I'm not--
Grandma?
No.
And they think they are protecting my by moving.
Mess that kid up?
But you don't think that's a solution.
What?
A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
You don't have to be unfriendly.
Now that's true!
See?
Where what was.
Awful?  No.  It's just lonely. It's the loneliest time.
No--come on.  Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
How many rooms do you think there are?
You don't need to do that.
What a relief!
No!  I got to find him.
Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?
Yes.  And so terribly annoying when they cry.  I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
He hates me.
I was just talking a walk.  I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them.  I hate my life.  I just hate it.
Would you like to go home if we can arrange it?  Did you notify the parents?
My mother?
Goodbye, Judy.  Take it easy.
Are you and Mom home tonight?
What?
I didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.
Gabriel, let him go --
To all those cons...
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree...
Negative five?
Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here.
Yeah. Me too.  Why? I mean I know why for me, why I paid for the ad. But you... why start writing to some guy -- some con -- you don't even know?
Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
No boyfriend of mine is going to walk around in negative-five degree wind chill without a goddamn good- looking coat!
No, lover. I'll see what you can do.
Your brother...
What's going ON!!!
Nick, no --
You sold him out.
Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
I love you!
Nick died for me....
Not without you.
He working for them on this one?
They're truck drivers.
Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike.
You saved me.
Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
Merry Christmas.
No, you can't --
She says a lot of things.
She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart.
J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
What's her middle name?
Her brother.
The hell you don't.
We got faith in you, Nick Mason.  You're our inside man.
When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the... uh...  ...the Powwow Safe.
Don't tip.
...ttt..tt... two out of three?
There'll be people in that casino. I can't keep them from leaving if I don't get a gun. I don't need bullets, Monster... but I gotta be a threat.
Fuckin' freezing.
My what?!
Oh, man --
Three days, man.
Fuck your hot chocolate, Rudy.
No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.
Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
GUARD!!!
Ash... Ashley...
You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money --
THEY'LL OPEN ONE!
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot -
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew.
I wanna. But I gotta show this asshole I got an honest-to-goodness job before he'll let me move out on my own. I can't work for you guys and be worried about gettin' back before ten o'clock curfew.
Really? Who's your P.O.?
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
This better not be some Freddy joke.
Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.
What? Snap out of it!
Fuckin' asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house.
Chew? Toby Chew? No.
Give me my book.
That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.
Mr. Pink?  Why?
Freddy Newendyke.
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
Nice Guy Eddie.
Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've been here a long fuckin' time, and she's only filled my cup three times. When I order coffee, I want it filled six times.
Dead.
Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.
Shot my way out. Everybody was shooting, so I just blasted my way outta there.
Where? Are they out in the car?
Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.
Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat.
I think he's just passed out.
Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.
You gotta idea, spit it out.
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
Don't fuckin' patronize me.
If we don't, he'll die.
There's a slight difference.
Graham's got something to tell you might interest you.
Nobody. The light was bad.
It doesn't matter who they are.
As far as -- Sonora?
I'm not running a stage line, ma'am, and I can't take a chance on losing the horses.
And look at it this way. How about Jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot.
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
Hold on.
No, thanks.  I hope we won't be a burden to them.
Yes. But -- that was the other night. Now -- I don't think I would.
I suppose that's my fault.
If you want to go on, I can make it all right.
She's a friend -- took off this morning sort of sudden while I wasn't around.
A little hot.
Yes.
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
And meet him there.
Things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear.
Sure I remember. You went to Mexico lookin' for cattle.
I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.
Just the grub box and bed rolls.
Kind of feeling your oats this morning. I haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old.
Kind of sore.
All right, you didn't know.
Stop it -- stop it.
That's right -- you go back to sleep. Tomorrow when you feel better things will look a whole lot different. Don't you worry about anything -- Mary's going to talk things over with your folks --
Then why stay in the hills.
Plenty more.  And somewhere up there's the lode, the rock rotten with it.
They shouldn't have done that.
Quit worryin' about Elaine.
Mine's gone lame. Take a look at him.
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.
Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?
How about California?
Oh, sure.
That's always tough. How long were you together?
I found a picture of his wife.
That's it.
Now, why that bitch gotta bring that shit this way? I hope she didn't see me.
So, I guess I can go now.
Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
Okay.
Her hair doesn't have as many split ends at yours. Her skin isn't as oily as yours, either. Also, sometimes your eyes get kinda squinty and they look like you might have Down's Syndrome or something. Otherwise the resemblance is uncanny.
Oh.
I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.
Made you say it!
Yes, we made it!
Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....
Now you gotta learn the correct slang.
Yeah, you feel that? Now put it all together.
Only that if this cat did attack, he's less likely to come back if the two of you were, let's say, together. Come on, it's college. Time for you two to experiment.
There's something going on in this house. I'm not crazy.
Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
That one.
That's why we came here, remember?
Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.
Well, there's a lot riding on this project.
That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.
Second best.
Not unless you have a paternity test to prove it.
Because she will lie?
Get out?! What does it say?
"Fucked me."
The "Citizen Kane" of gore movies.
Mrs. Sutphin?
You said you hated him.
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
Why?
Looks good, Mom!
Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?
And all that gore better hadn't be interfering with your schoolwork.
Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli... 
Did you recognize the voice of the caller?
COCKSUCKER! 
You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking?
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
What do you mean, you're not sure?!
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
No, honey, it's the police.  Hello, officers.
Watch the booth! I'll be back! 
I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
No...  I don't have room in my kitchen...
We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one!
Yes, ma'am, it is.
Then you know that if I give you a little advice, it'll be good advice.
I haven't any money but I'll get a job and --
Yes. She bought my sister's business.
That's what I tried to find out.	I went to La Jeunesse ——  -- used a phony health inspector's badge —— they let me go through the works -- all but one room. That room was locked. I'd like to see the inside of that room.
You come to me with some wild story about her being in danger - naturally I want to know what kind of danger. I want to know where she is.
What circumstances?
It's on Peary Street. Just ask the people who run it. They'll remember her.  People who see Miss Jacqueline never forget her.
Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
Redi's all right.
Thank you.
It's not much money, but it's enough to live on. You'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room.
Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -—
Who the devil is he?
It's what I should have done yesterday. I'll take her away somewhere where she can rest.
But I understand her. That may be more important.
Well, that's illuminating.
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
I don't know.
I won't get lonely.
You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious.
And you knew he'd be here.
But you're happy here -- you like your work —-
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
Bella Romari	If I were not seated, I would embrace you in three movements like a sonata.  Ah, my wonderful one. Fly with me tonight. We will take your coffee machine and live with the gypsies.
I saw you with her last week. I knew you'd be here tonight. Where is she?
It sounds strange, and I'm going to be very wary.
Cloven hoof?
It seems right to us.
Because you are intelligent -- that's why they sent me to you --
A gay lot -— Redi, for instance.  I don't know what her sorrow is,	but her life's an empty one. She's had to have this to cling to. Frances Fallon, with her worship of Jacqueline, has had to follow like a sheep. And Bruns, the fanatic. And you...
Mary, I'm amazed. Didn't Jacqueline tell you? She sold the business to me at least eight months ago. It's my business now.
Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
But she was here?
Oh. Well, please sit down.
Curious.
Why is that?
Why do you say I'm self-conscious?
Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?
Are you in the middle of something?
Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.
Donna. On this tape it says "Donna".
Can we look at one?
No.
About sex?
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
You know?
That's a good question.
Ann Bishop Millaney.
It's a simple question. Have you ever thought of having -- making love with someone other than your husband?
Absolutely not.
Did the person you made love with satisfy you more than your husband?
I guess not.
If I asked you to, would you? Not on tape, I mean?
No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
Kind of. I mean, John's like this kind of... craftsman. Like he's a carpenter, and he makes really good tables. But that's all he can make, and I don't need anymore tables.
I'm not in love with you.
But that was part of it?
Possibly.
As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
Because.
And I'm telling you it's not any one thing that I can point to and say "That's why!" It doesn't work that way with people who have problems, Ann, it's not that neat, it's not that tidy! It's not a series of little boxes that you can line up and count. Things just don't happen that way.
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.
I'm sorry. It's just... I'm under a lot of pressure with this Kirkland thing, it's my first big case as junior partner, and I work all day, I come home, I look forward to seeing you, and... it hurts that you accuse me like that.
Radon leakage?
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
No, he left last week.
I guess.
Yes.
Why?
Jesus, Ann, get a life. I just asked what he looked like.
Do you have to say that?
What?
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
And what?
No, it's nothing like that.
What kinds of questions?
Cynthia, who knows where that tape may end up? He could be... bouncing it off some satellite or something. Some horny old men in South America or something could be watching it.
You touched him?
I can't believe you did that!!
What is it?
Wait a minute. Do you mean... don't tell me you... in front of him.
I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
No, I really can't. I find it healthy never to characterize people I don't know or conversations I haven't heard. I don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else. Last time I saw Ann she left here very... confused, I would say. And upset.
She still is.
Well, I don't really listen to her when it comes to men. I mean, look at John, for crissake. Oh, you went to school with him didn't you? You're probably friends or something.
Not exactly.
Why don't you let me tape you?
Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
I turn on the camera. You start talking.
No. If anything, after I looked at it awhile, it got more interesting. It had character, you know?
If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
Do you like the way I look?
Yes.
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
Don't give me this passive/aggressive bullshit. If you want to leave, leave. My life doesn't stop when you walk out the door, you know what I'm saying?
You are scum. I'll be there.
You know what I mean.
She's there? What's she doing there?
You told Ann about this?
I wish you hadn't done that.
You trust him.
No.  You said three-fifty?
What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
I like having the car, the car is important.
I need help? Whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, Graham? Not me, buddy. You're the fucking nut. Now show me those tapes.
No.
I'm not kidding, Graham, you'd better do what I say. Give me those tapes.
Anyway, I've always said, the work is the thing. I can be happy without a marriage, but take away my work, that's different. And if Ann can't handle that, that's her problem, like we re all alone in this world, you know what I'm saying? I mean, fuck.  Jesus, what's takin' this guy?
All right, jesus.
You knew these people?
So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
Will you be OK now? I've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. I've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
Oh, no! You're not leaving me here all alone. I'm going with you.
We live in 703.
You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
Who was she?
That you, Rog?
I don't get it.
Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
YOUNG MALE INTERN, TALL AND HANDSOME

BREAKING OUT
As Janet's parents this should be really easy.  Your last clue... Mental Instability.  You have thirty seconds.
You got it!
LITTLE BLACK DRESS
Farley is already a TV winner as we shall see.  Dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene.
Yes, Betty.
Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind.
Yes, Betty.  But the false promise of a new dawn is usually followed by a most bloody sunset.
Indulge?
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?
Could you tell us a little about it?
Who?
Vance!  Vance Parker.
Good!  Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
Me?
Foods!
We understand you've been going through a rather trying time.
No.
No, we're from San Diego. Why?
I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.
Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?
Glass or bottle?
Is it chicken?
Stephanie.
Oh yeah.
You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die!
Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
Sure is tasty.
I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.
And get your bone smooched.
Let me call Christine.
Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
Now tip it. What you're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim. Tells you how old it is, among other things, usually more important with reds. This is a very young wine, so it's going to retain its color pretty solidly. Now stick your nose in it.
I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
You know her?
Sure I know Maya.
She is very hot.
Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work?
Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
About a month ago. Six weeks.
Is she bringing him to the wedding?
You have the keys.
Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
Okay! Fuck!
You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
Count me out.
Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.
You have to tell me --
I SAID OKAY?
I say we check it out. You never know.
I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
What's up?
Yeah.
Looks like you were in a bad car accident.
I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.
My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
You're so negative.
What the fuck!
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
The Windmill.
She got anything good?
Yeah, I know.
She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
Good. So did I.
Okay. See you around.
About two-thirty.
Okay.
Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Just some local Pinot, you know, then a little Burgundy. That old Cotes de Beaune!
Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
So how're you doing?
About four weeks.
I told you I need a drink.
Yes.
That's a game isn't it?  Anyway...  There's been some interesting developments.
He was trying to eat a second chocolate bar. Your grandma said, "No." He tried to take a bite, so I grabbed it.
Oh.
Sounds made up.
Now we're talking.  How about you Merrill?
What about them?
Why not?
It's like War of the Worlds.
Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie.
It's one thing to know it...
How's Mr. Parker doing?
Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.
I had to get up anyway.
Yup. The whole rig. I don't care much about the rest, but I surely will miss that bay. Least they didn't kill me. That was right considerate, I thought. They were laughing when they left me. Thought it was real funny. I walked for a little while but there was no use, so I gave it up. Figured it was just bad luck.
All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.
Whose law? The law here runs a man down -- just like these cattle.
Because they don't like what I want.
Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
That ain't right.
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
Don't press your luck, Carter.
Rae, all we got is each other.
What makes you think I could?
We'll handle that. He's careless.
You've got a legitimate job.
So we understand each other?
We didn't talk about this.  They took the little boy, Cobb.
What's she got to do with it?
Not a thing. She's just a mutual friend.  But if you wind up on the wrong side of this, she's going to get hurt.
Thanks. That's what I call it too.
It's the only place I'm happy.
Me too. What's wrong with us?
I meant, seemed like a lot of whiskey.
Is that what he said? Well, he figured it okay this time.
I don't want you to get hurt.
Oh, yeah, you two are going to get along fine. You got a lot in common.
Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.
Who?
We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!
You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
Why isn't she with you?
Why not?
Why not?
She was in the theater?  When? Where?
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
I'll walk you out.
-- I don't think that's necessary. I think it's perfectly clear.  I should have guessed -- it all makes sense now... it's why she never goes anywhere, never seen in public...
She doesn't want pity.
Excuse me?  Start?
As a matter-of-fact I am.
You?
Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
Just a minute.
-- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
I have to talk to her.
... so much like her?
Do what you do to Simone.
I'm not even sure I deserve it. After tonight I'll have almost as much screen time on your show as I do in my movies.  How is that healthy for a performer?
We all do.  But now I understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting.
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
Clyde.
Body double.
Absolutely not!
You can't.
Simone!
I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked skin.  I licked hair.  I licked every part of her.
Good and bad.  They think that's what caused this.  Me eye tumor. Microwaves from the screen.  It's the size of a grapefruit.  Heavy too.
I don't know anything about computers.
You saw that?
We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
I can't believe you people!  No wonder she never comes to these things!
You look very grown up.  What are you doing?  You meeting your mom for dinner?
I know plenty of boys.
How?
If anyone asks about Simone --
Really?  Too bad.
An insanity defence.
I'm keeping it in trust.
This should take care of Mother.
Which means they're significant.  Incriminating.  Perhaps, criminal.  She's hiding her past.  She's hiding her past.
What do you want -- ?
I never apologized properly for what happened on "Sunrise".
Yes.  Yes, I'm going to tell the truth about you, why wouldn't I...?  Of course, with Hank's tragic passing, the secret died with him.  I am going to tell the truth... after your next picture.
Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?
What, Anna? What did I do? What's made you so sad?
I trust you... Besides, I don't know if I'm up for the Amish today. You can't curse or spit or anything around them.
I knew there was a sound explanation.
...De profundis clamo ad te domine.
He your best buddy?
I don't tell her a thing.
Soon. One week.
No.
I guess she did.
Anything bad about me?
That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
Like what?
Hell, he was your grandfather. You know what he did.
I ain't never played a banjo in my life.
Witch.
Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.
Yeah. It's the alternator all right.
I didn't do anything --
No shit.
Not someone -- Mac.
Suzie, face it. The only "axe" he's picked up since we came here... is a real one. He doesn't give a damn about the band anymore... or about you.
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
Wrong. Fratricide is when you gun down your brother. You're out. My turn.
Shotgun. Suicide. Next?
I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
Manure... is life.
It harvests! It threshes! Look at these blades.
The Sheriff?! We don't need the sheriff!!! We need to get the hell out of here!
Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away.  Wasn't much right before that, neither.
I --
What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!
-- picked tonight to come by and watch our set.
So?
I bet if he were still alive, he'd like to watch.
'Mornin', Jack.
That's not funny.
Whatcha' doin'?
Hey, Grant.
I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
That wasn't a good night, no.
Okay.
What do you see? I see a butterfly.
Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out for these things. If you see 'em, keep your mouth covered. Otherwise they'll go straight down it. All right?
Don't worry, Chief.
Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
What other stuff?
Last year, this was a new rig.
Why? You have a bowling date?
Who'd want to?
A what?
Is this fun?
You just passed your nemesis.
I don't know. We were planning on seeing the Astrodome.
Eleven.
Ciao.
You might have said no. I have trouble handling rejection.
You want to lose this putz or not?!?
You only smoked three cigarettes through the entire state of Mississippi.
No.
Now, if I say go to channel three, it really means go to six.
Six. Got it.
If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
Why are we doing this?
Can a pig whistle?
Clear and rolling.
What's your twenty?
Then don't.
-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
We're gone.
Now what?
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
Roger. Keep the shiny side up and the greasy side down.  Right, Fred?
We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
You're about to hit a convoy. Tighten up your rubber band. The oncoming's clear.
Go breaker.
See, running Coors Beer east of Texas is what bothers me. It makes me a bootlegger.
That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.
-- so you shut them off?
And a very bad gamble.
Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
No. And I want to be in that room a half second after Mecklen calls to say the deal's done. We've got a sheriff's task force on stand-by.
Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
No.
Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh --
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --
Pretty much, yep.
-- Fine, fuck, I got it... Lake Tahoe, Nevada. I'll have Hugo book your flight, you can be here in a couple hours. He'll meet you at the airport.
I know you left him a message. What did you say!
Okay.
Then why are you still looking at me like I'm asking for the square root of something! What did you say!?
...See, this is one'a them rare moments when y'ass get a chance to be completely honest... and if I'm asking you what you said to Mecklen, assume the shit is rhetorical... so assume I already know.
-- this isn't a swap meet Morrey, they're getting Sparazza and the west coast syndicate, giftwrapped, now if that's not good enough --
Israel's legal representation, the firm of Culpepper, Brody and Reed, which is currently the subject of a joint SEC and Treasury Department probe, were left holding the bag after he skipped bail. Over three- quarters of a million dollars on a bond that's set to expire in less than a day. Rupert Reed, one of the firm's partners, has learned of Israel's whereabouts and dispatched a local bondsman by the name of Jack Dupree to pick him up and return him to Las Vegas... that can't happen.  We have a Gulf Stream standing by at Reagan International to transport you two to Lake Tahoe.  It's very simple gentlemen. Valacchi, Fratiano, Gravano -- no former witness against the mob has been as crucial or has brought more to bear on the potential dissolution of The La Cosa Nostra, than Buddy Israel.
...Almost.  What do you mean "who Sparazza actually was..."
Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover.
No... It's not.  What it lacks... is an end.
Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
What were you doin' here anyway?
Damn, this kevlar ridin' up on me, I wish they made this more sheer.
You know I burned all his shit. All that vinyl. Chalamar, Funkadelic, I burned his turntables too. They was like three-thousand brand new.
They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.
You're being tricked.  Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth.
Listen --
She reappeared exactly as she had before?
Whose side are you on?
How much sleep?
I told you, try to stay calm.  You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch.
Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed.
I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
But they are human.  They certainly become human with incredible speed. First they're like they were in our memory, but then they fill in on their own.  DNA doesn't determine the hundreds of trillions of connections that occur in the brain, it's not dense enough.  They build up with experience.
Oh, this one you love?  What about the first one, the one you fucked and then put into a rocket and blasted into space?  You didn't love her?
Just get him to stop.
Her oxygen would have run out.
You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you.  She will die.  Then what will you do?
I'll go with you.
To calm your anxiety.
Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive.  We had to unlearn everything.
The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man.  Even the limits we put on it are human limits.  It can do this, it can do that!  It designs, it creates!
How old were you?
I know.  I know.  We don't have to talk about that.
It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out.  Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless.  Unblinking in his prejudice.
When?  When I'm asleep?
I'm just trying to understand what's going on.
Was she right?
But that's what happened before.
Don't call me that.
I'm disgusting.
You should have told me.
You never said you wanted one.
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
When?
It's an experiment.
And when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the... original, the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness.
Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
Fuck me.  I knew it.
Occasionally.
Right.  That's true.
I'm supposed to call in.
He thinks you're being a little careless.  He made the point several times.
Let's get a drink.
Sooner, the better.
Right.  How could he do that if he's in jail and they've thrown away the key...?
Hmm...
Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
Absolutely.  Look at this.
Okay.  Let's just see if a mugger gets me.
Sleep good.
It's just me.  I want to talk to you.  Let me in...
Okay, then let's make it easy.  It was a mistake.  Don't make me feel guilty now that it's over, let's forget about it.
Not exactly.
What do you want to do?
Yeah.
Yeah...
I don't know...
Not if you don't want me to.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
Claire...
'Til they pick up the perp.  Seniority gets day shift... You know what that means.
I can still use a gun.
It's twenty bucks in the bank.
Let 'em eat their hearts out.
Why?
Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
I had to follow her to a store.
It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
Did you hear what I said?!!
What're you talking about --
I don't remember Michael, go to sleep.  You don't have to make conversation with me.
We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the locals.  Throw it!
No, sir...
That's right, you're gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
I brought the girl.  She's outside.
She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.
Koontz!  Let her come in!  Claire! It's pitch dark in here!  You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall.  Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door!
I'm not lettin' no one go.
Except the goddamn skateboards, which are everywhere!  I'd like to kill the guy who invented those things.
Yeah, I think so.
Mom and I got plans.
We're gonna pass the street.
Shooting?
S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
Or was it all a dream?
I like enthusiasm.  That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids.  Not just 'cause they work cheap.
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
What if you get hurt?
How very dull, Peter Parker.
You should write that one down.
Eugene.  Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like "Flash."
I'd never admit that.
What's your problem?
Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
Precise equipment… such as waldos…
I'll introduce you.
Yes.  Do you have a date?
Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
I left a paper in my desk.
Truth. Pure, eternal.  Beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.
Oh. Yeah.  Thanks.
Nah.  The big mask was better.
Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become… whatever it is you are?
And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical, isn't it?
Just drop me off here.
No, no!  Not there!
They never caught on.
Jawohl!
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
Forget it. He'll be back here. They've got no proof.
Looks good outside.
Static!
Look, this may be my last hot breakfast on account of they're going to take away that stove. So will you let me eat it in peace?
You ain't going to squeal this one, brother.
We're looking at it.
I'll call the whole pot.
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
You are talking crazy!
I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.
Abfuehren!
Of course you did! Twenty-six carloads of munitions gone off like a trick cigar! The S.S. is running around in circles. The Gestapo is arresting the wrong people. And von Scherbach has caught the fish. Most amusing, isn't it?
I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
I am not. According to the Geneva Convention --
Isn't it?
Perfectly all right. I do not like boots.
Stop it, Harry!
You can say that again!
Comrade! Comrade! Otchi Tchorniya -- Otchi Tchorniya!
I don't care if they wear galoshes!
Betty Grable!
Yeah? How you going to fix me up with Betty Grable?
Me? What if she don't want me?
Where'd that come from?
You hold him. I'll slug him.
Animal! Got a little something for you!
Yes, Sergeant Hoffman?
Anything else?
Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.
Answer the question. How do you rate all those privileges?
I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
Come on, everybody!  Let's go!
Every time the men get Red Cross packages you have to think up an angle to rob them.
There better not be anything missing. This is private property.
So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
You starting that again?
Who did?
Oh.
Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
Amazing, what you can do with five thousand ping-pong balls, isn't it?
Ach, terrible! Such foolish boys. Such nice boys. I'd better not talk about it. It makes me sick to my stomach.
You Americans! You are the craziest people! That's why I like you! I wish I could invite you all to my house for a nice German Christmas!
How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
Not particularly.
Approximately two hundred thirty million.
No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.
That is true. However, I believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse. For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more "human"- to grow beyond my original programming. And yet I am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor. This emotion chip is the only answer.
During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
Thanks.
All hands, brace for impact!
There's some buckling on the starboard nacelle.  We've also got a hull breach in the Engineering section. Emergency forcefields are in place and holding.
What's the "Nexus"?
She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.
Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
There's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude!
Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire on my command.
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
You want me to contact Starfleet?
Ever since I was a little boy, I remember hearing about the family line. The Picards that fought at Trafalgar, the Picards that settled the first Martian colony. When my brother married and had a son...
The only possible reason you're here is because you're not entirely confident you can shoot down my probe after all. So you've come to dissuade me from my horrific plan.  Good luck.
Not if it means killing over two hundred million people.  I wonder, did your wife Leandra know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder?
What if I told you I found a new truth?
Lursa and B'Etor? This doesn't make any sense. A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps Geordi and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades. Why? What the hell's going on?
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
Keep trying, Chekov. At regular intervals.
Scotty...?
Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?
Not from here, no.
Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
Short range scan.
... Or <u>who</u>.
Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out.
That may be difficult...
I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
No!... I'll do it.  Give me your phaser.
Request permission to beam aboard immediately.
We are under attack! Stand by for evasive -- stand by for --
Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?
Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
The <u>doors</u>, Mr. Scott!
Aye, sir!
Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
What? What are you saying?
I think it's an energy form, sir...
Close... There --
Welcome home, Jim.
As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
You're right.  Thanks for the drink.
Any time.
Wait! Give me a chance --
But, why?
You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!
Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him.
Of course...!
Success, my lord.
Station!
Steady. Continue on impulse power.

Sir, may I --
Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
I can spare me...
Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.
We each face death every day we're alive, Saavik.
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
Come on, Mother, that's just the military mentality. Never put off tomorrow what you can put off today. If there's one atom of life...
I know, I know...
You do that and you'll have murdered your father.
What's the matter -- ?
I am truly sorry.
I give you sixty seconds, Admiral.
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
Admiral? He didn't tell you how <u>Admiral</u> Kirk sent seventy of us into exile on this barren sand heap with only the contents of these cargo bays to sustain us?
Aye, sir --
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power.
It had the virtue of never having been tried.
Home.
Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours.
The power of creation --
Regula is class "D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space.
Or the one.
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
I failed to resolve the situation.
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
Erased...
Stage Two of what?
Aye, sir.
Trying, sir!
He's very human.
Aye, sir.
As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.
You do this -- for friendship?
Just a couple of kooks...
And finally, they're not human beings, you know. Their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --
I don't know about you, but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence.  I mean whales may not have painted the Mona Lisa or invented the dirt bike but they didn't ravish the land either.
Why don't I?
I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott. I explained you'd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don't seem to know anything about it.
A moment alone, please.
It'll come back to him.
Mr. Sulu... Take us home...
Would you prefer to do nothing?
If you have a better idea - now's the time.
Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.
Cramps.
I liked him better before he died.
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
It is.
I was not informed about observers.
Reading the patient's vital signs.
Fundoscopic examination --
We're out of control -- Rig for collision...
My name?
I suppose they told you that...?
To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. A hundred years ago, using hand-thrown harpoons, they did plenty of damage -- but that was nothing compared to what they've achieved in this century.
Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
Go ahead.
You're upset about losing the whales.
... You're very perceptive.
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
... Gone?!
Calm yourself, Nurse.  Scotty, get us out of here!
Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.
Simple logic will suffice. We need a map.  That one should do.
... Simple logic.
Yes.
Admiral, may I ask you a question?
Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?
Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: "Double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth...
I cannot tell a lie.
They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
... I see.
Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
I will, Admiral.
Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort?
We'll divide into teams. Commanders Chekov and Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem.
Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
Mr. Sulu?
Sorry, sir. We can't even do that in the 23rd Century.
I'll have to re-energize.
Full power, sir.
Of course.
... Yes?
Just use the keyboard...
All right, then this is old stuff to you.
I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you.
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.
If I were in your shoes, I'd feel the same way after what happened.  The 'artificial lifeform' is a member of my crew. Apparently, he became... ill...
To move you off this planet. You go to sleep one night in your village... wake up the next morning in this flying holodeck transported en masse. A week later, maybe a month, you've been relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it.
We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
You give me more credit than I deserve. Of course, I'm tempted. Who wouldn't be?  But some of the blackest marks in the history of my world have involved the forced relocation of a small group of people to satisfy the demands of a larger one. I'd like to believe we learn from our mistakes. Obviously, some of us haven't.
You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
By now the Son'a have scanned the area and know that just as well as we do.
I'll be here.
I am better.
No... I want to stay with you...
Won't he rust?
Your Captain used to cut quite a rug...
It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
Another forty-three people reported taken, sir...
That is not an acceptable option. If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation...
We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. They're calling this whole area The Briar Patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me Data's schematics. I'll keep you informed.  Dougherty out.
In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
Just a few loose ends to tie up. Dougherty out.
How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...
Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.
Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
Scan for lifesigns.
Are they...?
Do you know how they were damaged?
Fail-safe?
The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
I'll be in Engineering.
You Klingons never do anything small, do you...
Aye, sir.
Fat chance. I'll post it on every monitor on the ship...
I understand. Tell Doctor Crusher to have a hypospray of lectrazine ready...
Make it so.
Transferring controls to manual.
No. We'll be responsible for that, Mister Worf.
You should feel right at home with them.
I never kissed you with a beard before.
Activating injector assembly.
Isolate one and re-route its command sequence through the auxiliary processor...
Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp.
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
Are you saying they won't help us?
It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread...
... is to yourself. Don't make me hurt you again...
No.
Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery.
I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
I am the Borg.
I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.
I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...
I told you, there's no --
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
I'm very sorry.
I can try.
You'd have to try real hard. No one's used currency in over ten years. What are you, from another planet?
I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in --
Are you always sucha good judge of character?
Too bad.  Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies.
We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --
A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.
It's the future, isn't it? Just like you told Scrimm.  I knew you weren't from around here.
You've been interfering with my life ever since I met you.  Don't stop now.
Aye, sir.
Aye, sir.
Can't tell. Long-range bio- sensors are off-line.
They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
Just a little queasy...
And Commander, whatever you do... do <U>not</U> vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant.
Emergency override!
Where the hell are they going?
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.
I'll bear it in mind, Admiral. I think that's all.
Fascinating...
We DO sleep lying down.
I didn't mean this future.
Are we playing multiple choice?
Once we're beyond the shield they should be able to pick it up two sectors away.
Come on...
Ah. I believe you also consumed Romulan ale at the officers' mess on the night of question, Doctor?
Barely.
I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
They'll make it look like an accident...
You feign ignorance?
You crippled our gravitational field with a direst torpedo hit, and two Starfleet crewmen beamed aboard in magnetic boots and did this! WE HAVE WITNESSES!
Those words WERE spoken by me.
So if it should prove members of your crew did in fact carry out such an assassination - ?
Your honors, the State rests.
Uhura, monitor!
Then all we've got is a neutron radiation surge - and by the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes...
Aye, sir; thrusters...
Do we report this, sir?
Thank you, Captain.
This cannot be easy for you, Captain...  I would feel awkward if I had to give you a tour of OUR vessel...
Kill him! He's the one!!
Possibly.
Energize...
Saavik, sir. We were told you'd need a helmsman -  ... so I volunteered.
Uhura, signal our surrender.
I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked.
They're dying.
Far be it for me to dispute my first officer. Starfleet has always -
From Enterprise?
The Commander is an old friend of yours.
I SHOULD have been -
Not for the actions of another. No one is responsible for any actions but his own. Human beings -
Make ourselves a target?
This is the Starship Enterprise, Captain James Kirk commanding.
This is Enterprise. We surrender. Repeat  Enterprise surrenders --
Who else?
Faith...?
A lie?
Fifty-four planets - and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies. Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well.
Thank you, Mr. Scott. We were to return to spacedock, the killers would surely manage to dispose of their incriminating footwear.
I do not understand.
No. Can I move now?
Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
I think a skin cell’s the more likely of the two.
You're working late.
Can you describe it, Deanna?
Dying?
I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time.
Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
And this makes you "sad"?
Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown. Keep at it. Anything you can give me would be appreciated. Dismissed.
He believes he has our communications protocols. But they will give him inaccurate locations for all Starfleet vessels.
It would appear so.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
While I find that fascinating, Data, we really need that Goddamned door open!
But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.
He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin
It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers!
Sir.
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
An individual more like you, you mean.
Yes.
Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  I need you at my side. Now more than ever I...
Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
When this is over, I owe you a drink.
And that's exactly what he's going to do.

There's more... as always. He's Reman.
Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.
Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear...  Naked.
Come now, a big, strapping fellow like you? What are you afraid of?
If you don't mind.
Where we will all honor the Betazoid traditions. No cold feet, or any other parts of our anatomy. Now, if you’ll excuse me.  I’ll be in the gym.
I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
Anything.
I intend to.
Then perhaps the time has come to add some illumination to our discussion. Computer, raise lighting four levels.
No race should be a slave to another.
I have no reason to.
No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
Don't be so vain. After we found it, we made a few modifications. An extra memory port, a hidden transponder. Perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn I've gained access to Starfleet's communications protocols. I now know the location of your entire fleet ...  You may go.
Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.
Long ago.
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
Do as I tell you!
Seven minutes.
FULL STOP AND FIRE !
I came this far alone ...
Praetor.
It's there. The fog's thicker now, but it's there. What do you think started those fires?
Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
They're damned expensive and a pain in the ass sometimes, but I wouldn't trade having them for anything.
Stay right there...
Elmo's...
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband.
I don't like it, George...
Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
I just retired.
Marc Shermin.
What.
Minneapolis.
Closed?
Are you from up there? Space?
I am husband?
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
Shit... shit... what shit?
Stop!! Enough!! Jesus! You're worse than a parrot!!
Yes.
Three nights... two days.
I can't... Forget the baby. Okay? The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells. You'll have to hitchhike the rest of the way.
The driver will...
But I speak English.
I do not speak English.
Not every car, but... a car will stop... Maybe not the first car... maybe number eight, number fifteen...
Can I have the gun?
Yes?
What?
I was afraid.
A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
What is hell?
Are you my friend?
Hurry up.
No. Get in.
What do you want from me? There are no cars on this road. I didn't ask for this stupid storm.
We'll get a ride in the morning.
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
I understand.
Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know.
I understand.
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
I will say that we can be friends.
I will.
My grandmother's rich.
Slow down, slow down.
Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
I've been investigating sightings for seventeen years, Mr. Shermin. This one's real. We have a dead extra- terrestrial in that tent and another one in the area that might be alive. We've been visited. It's finally happened and the sooner Washington accepts that and starts figuring out how we're going to deal with these beings, the better off we're going to be.
Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
No.
I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.
Scott Haydn is dead. He died about three months ago. We went to the funeral.
We will.  Something's wrong here. She's helping him now.
I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.
Hold on a minute... Let's take the chance, George.
Bullshit politics.
It's always politics.  Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right?  But I could pay you more not to.  See what I mean?  I could write you a check right now--
Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder.  See we call it "being wired," but there's no wire.  You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?
A tragic story, no doubt.  How'd you get up here?
Fuck you.
Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
Jesus.
No, Lenny.
Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself.
You know one of the ways movies still have Squid beat?  Because they always say "The End." You always know when it's over.  It's over! Now please leave.  I have to go on again in a couple of minutes.
Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
Oh God, Lenny.  I was trying to keep you out of this.
That's right.
Clips.
Thanks, Max.
It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
Not now... I don't want to think about it--
He records himself raping and killing her--
But this is a bad one.
Why me?
This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...
Well... the guy's fucked up.
I already got everything I need from you.
Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.
Mace!  You're a life-saver.
Fumitsu.
She's my destiny.
So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
Maybe.  But tonight is probably not the best night.  Come on, we're rollin'.
Well give me some then... I'm starving.
Aw, Mom!
Zorro. Yes, ran it through my files, even asked around: came up completely blank. Thought there might be a Mexico connection, El Paso and all, but nothing. Fooled around with the letter "Z," turned it on it's side, got "N" -- there Ng, he's Vietnamese. The only thing that came to mind was zero, not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?
I'm babysitting the DEA guys this afternoon, Casio and I. You said that was top priority.
I just assumed she ran away. Happens a lot around here. Look around. This place is an invitation to run away.
Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?
A grill pattern.
Look...
It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.
Nada. Vague description, that's all. Fine-tooth-combed Speck's car, the diner: no fingerprints, no trace evidence.
Smarter than us.
Serial killer killed. In Ft. Myers. Cut up in his van. And this time we got a witness.
Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
This better be important.
Speck. Harold Speck.
I'm told you've asked for a Bureau cross-check of flight records to and from El Paso, Ft. Myers, Omaha, the Murman murder time frames.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
The man knew how to dress.
Setting up. Technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. But, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. The correspondent becomes "ghosted," invisible.
Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month."
And one other thing.
Don't be too harsh.
I know.
Murman and Imelda had been slipping into a private chat room. Low had poor old Testa drooling on the keyboard. Abduction fantasies, voyeurism, mutilation, teasing him with fetish elements. He is very good. I think it's safe to say Richard Low is Murman.
Not the way I can.
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
Suspect Zero.
What's going on?
And you're working with him?
They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead.
You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.
You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.
It was the mall.
[Follow me.]
[What does the file say?]
I want to go live with you.
Thomas Mackelway.
I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.
This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
Speck is dead.
I don't know about that.
Shut up.
I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. Let me make it up to you.
I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks.
Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
Tell me about it...
Uh, if the guy wants to.
...piece of shit. Listen, Charles, this is my friend Rob from Back East.
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
They were auditioning for the same role as you?
No matter what... like splitting aces.
Did you get it?
Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.
Yeah. And an actor.
Hey, at least it's not Goofy.
Hi, Mike?
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
Thanks. Thanks, man.
I got to at least try once.
I'll be your winger.
Oh boy.
She wasn't your type anyway.
...People get carjacked...
What are they doing here?
We ran into them that night at Roscoe's. Tee cleared it up, I apologized, bought them some chicken and waffles. They fuckin love Tee. That boy can talk.
Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
Listen to you. I got an audition for a pilot at nine and I'm going. You gotta get out with some beautiful babies. You can't sit home thinking about her.
When?
Be downstairs. You're beautiful.
I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing.
This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.
Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free.
Always.
Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table.
Let's go.
What an asshole.
They know what you want, believe me. Pretending is just a waste of time. You're gonna take them there eventually anyway. Don't apologize for it.
Respect, my ass. They respect honesty. You see how they dress when they go out? They want to be noticed. You're just showing them it's working. You gotta get off this respect kick, baby. There ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party.
"Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
Well... we're not in Kansas anymore.
"Big Brother", "Little Brother"?
I'm telling you!
Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.
She really didn't do it for me, baby. How'd you like Dorothy?
I don't think so.
Why? So you can beat yourself up? Sitting around in that stuffy apartment. It's just plain bad for you, man. It's depressing. You've come so far. Remember the first week? After she told you? You couldn't even eat.
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
Baby, she's the one who should be thinking about you. Sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight. Trust me, Mikey, you're better off.
What? That was the best part of the old game.
It starts at eight...
Minnie Pearl.
Don't sweat it, baby. This one's a lay-up.
We're not messing with you...
No, baby!
Don't give me that! She liked you, man.
No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked.
What was cold about it?
...double diamond...
...and teeth... And she's like this little bunny cowering in the corner...
...Yeah. You're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
You're money.
Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. I want you to be the guy in the rated R movie who you're not sure if you like.
...Shut up, Sue...
Six.
Yes. 
But your daughter is still alive.
What are you, a dance judge?  Go do your job; take a walk around the neighborhood... see everything is okay.
Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month!
Maybe, or you gotta know now.
No.
When did he call?
On a day like this.  Consiglero, do you also have in your notes the the Turk made his living from Prostitution before the war, like the Tattaglias do now.  Write that down before you forget it.  The Turk will wait.
It's been two years.  He's probably in trouble again.
But you needed a drink first.
Now you've had your drink.
How did you find out?
Yes.
Corleone.
Long ago.  Now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas...the others escaped to America.
Bad news from America.  Your brother, Santino.  He has been killed.
Hey America!  Is she as rich as they say?
Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength.  Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war.  The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny.
Thanks Tom.
I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about Rocco Lampone building a secret regime.  Why does Neri report directly to you, rather than through me or a caporegime?
You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
Who is he?
He's coming over here!
I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.  He'll be hurt, but he won't object.
Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here.
Hello...this is Long Distance.  I have a call from New Hampshire.  Mr. Michael Corleone.  One moment please.
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
OK. 
I don't think so.  You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.
Goodbye.
Absolutely not!  We have to get permission from the Doctor.
The Turk wants to talk!  The nerve of that son of a bitch!  After he craps out last night he wants a meet.
The kid's right.
You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price.
I think so.  Detective squad?
What are you doing in Mongi?
Well, we ate everything without you.
Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent --  The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.
What?
No, I think your mother, her illness --
I have to go to Venice.
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient. 
Freddie Miles. You know -- he's organizing the Cortina skiing trip.
What are you talking about?
I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
You see, particularly with the Marge problem, you can just blame me.
I love Marge.
Marge, good morning. Unusual weather.
I think it might hurt her to know.
Perhaps you didn't mention them because there's only one conclusion to be drawn.
No, he should talk to you alone.
What a waste of lives and opportunities and --
Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.
Back, I suppose, slowly as I can.
Bird. That's jazz.
What does that mean?
Really? That's swell. No, I was just -- you're way ahead of me! Great!
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
No, well go if you want to, but don't talk to the Police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he's got a temper -- he could've hit Freddie.  Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you later.
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared.
To the manner born.
Why? When?
A hotel would've been fine.  We'll have to tell Mr Greenleaf how far his dollar has stretched.
No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when Tom arrived in Mongi.  And now look at you.
As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too.
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
I'll take them both.
You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't...
Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's.
And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much.
I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later. Later?
I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
Not at all. Morning Tom.
He says so many fiancées.
No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!
Or I could come back.
I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me.
Well, that's entirely your fault. And, if I fall overboard, that'll be your fault too.
Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.
Hardly kissing. Kissing off.
Peter, I... I...
Even her.
No!
Tomorrow.
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
Really?
You know what you remind me of?
No.  I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.
I'm leaving.
We can go to another movie if you like, I don't care. I got money. There's plenty...
No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
I'm getting a taxi.
First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --
What taxi driver?
Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos...
Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
I never use mine. But it's a good thing to have. Just as a threat.
What's your real name?
But you're the one that wanted to get away. You're the one that came into my cab.
Do they drug you?
I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time.
You just gonna leave 'em?
Well, Iris, I look at it this way. A lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful. And I figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out. And they hate it. So I figure the best I can do for them is not bother them at all. So I don't say a thing. I pretend I'm not even there. I figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it.
My work may take me out of New York.
Well, you should know, damn it, or who else would know? Pull over right here.  Why don't you stick your goddamn head out of the goddamn window once in a while and find out about the goddamn fog!
There must be something...
Well, he should clean up this city here. It's full of filth and scum. Scum and filth. It's like an open sewer. I can hardly take it. Some days I go out and smell it then I get headaches that just stay and never go away. We need a President that would clean up this whole mess. Flush it out.
Damn straight.
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
What kind of guns do you guys use? .38's?
Well, if you are, it's entrapment already.
What's going on?
Yeah, Iris. You know anybody by that name?
Hey Wizard.
Slow.
Yeah?
Well, I just, you know...
Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right.  I seen enough to know.
I join the F.B.I. I ask for fieldwork.  They say, "Bill, you're too fucking= smart for field work." Every year I put in for a transfer and every year I= sit in that goddamn lab like the fucking Maytag repairman in the= commercial.  Then the call finally comes, and it's a whole fuckin, city at= stake?  Oh Jesus...
MY girlfriend's pregnant.
What is happening?  Where's Mason?
What, vou?
I'm not the chemical weapons expert.
Womack ripped it up, right?
Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much.
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
Whatever happens.
Well... where can we go?
Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  "A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact.
Yes.  Hic!
Nothing.  
Eventually.  We were going to be  engaged... when you came back from  overseas...
Oh...
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
My what?
Thanks.
Guess I must've learned.
Delly.  I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father.  And I'm not... I'm not Luke.
Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead.  I also see that you were posted stateside during the war.  Fort Dix?
Good.  Good.  Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935.  A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it?
I... I need a drink of water.
No.  But...
The Jimmy Stewart picture?  I remember that one.  Saw it over at the Bijou.  So, you remember that, huh?
I remember the picture... but I don't remember where I saw it.
Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou.  There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt...
And... what's my name again?
Why?
No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
Well, I'm the first one to admit that I don't know anything about bookkeeping, but there are some very interesting things in here.
You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
It's possible.  I just don't remember.
Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
No, I'm not much of a dancer.
Even if we could, and the move didn't kill him, there'd be very little we could do there that we can't do here.  I'm sorry.
Hey, it's the best way to tell.
Wouldn't blame him if he was.
They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know.
Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.
Exactly.
Not at all.
Oh.
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
Well... something like that.  I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
Yes.
I'll get it, sit down, Miss Daniels. Do you want a sweater or something? A quilt?
It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.
Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now.
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.  You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
If your father were here...
Take them.
Don't you like Bodega Bay?
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
It's Alice, ain't it?
And the white house?
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
The front door.  Isn't there a back road I can take?
Of course.
They're back!
You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
I know, Mother.
Mother?
That's a chance we have to take.
But they'll be back.
We have to try it.  We can't stay here.  Melanie needs help.  Mother, the house won't take another attack.
If they are?
I started to say... inside...
Then he saw.
What good will they do?
Annie's there. She'll be all right.
Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do.  I'm not complaining. That's the mark of a man.  But...  You see, I... I wouldn't want to be... be left alone. I don't think I could bear being left alone.  I... forgive me. This business with the birds has me upset.  I... I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't here.
I'll just clear up here, and then dress.
Did you close the door?
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there. 
Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?
All right.  She smiles back.
Ahhh, but I know you.
You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
I'm sorry.  Who's your friend?
Yes?
I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way.
What?
His wife changed the channel.
Without any clothes on?
Yes, but...
So you didn't go to school together.
I wrote the letter.
What did it say?
Do you expect me to believe...?
But not for me.
I thought you knew! I want to go through life laughing and beautiful and jumping into fountains naked! Good night!
I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. We're going to have a lot of roast left over.
Cheers.
You have a job?
I'll get it.
The bay doesn't.
The past fifteen minutes.  It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again.
Yes.  I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.
Almost two a.m.
Wait here. Don't move.
No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
Thank you.  Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?
Birds are not aggressive creatures, Miss. They bring beauty to the world. It is mankind, rather, who...
These weren't a few birds.
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying as much.
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
Probably herring gulls. They arrive in November, you know, and don't migrate North again until March or...
It's not the failure. I feel that MacFarlane has taught me nothing. He taught me the mathematics of anatomy but he couldn't teach me the poetry of medicine.
Is it a great man whom Gray can order to his bidding? Is it a great man who for very shame dare not acknowledge his own wife so that I must play maidservant for the world's sake and his success?
But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.
What the devil do you mean?  You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you --
I remember her.
So she told me.  I'm a teacher -- not a practitioner.
Yes, I suppose so.
What do you mean, Fettes?
Tosh!  Fettes!  It's not their grief I'm worrying about -- I'm talking of our own end --
You couldn't do that, Doctor.
No room there. We'll have to set it between us.
Maybe there's another reason. Maybe you haven't friends enough. Could that be it, Georgina?
Hear him?  Did you ever see the lads play knife?
That has nothing to do with it. We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.
And you're a fool, Toddy -- and no doctor. It's only the dead ones that you know.
The nerve centers -- the brain --
Here, have another glass, MacFarlane. I'll take you home and we'll be friends again -- now that you know that you're Knox's man and my friend -- aye, forever.
Get out of here!
I've drunk enough tonight.
I never heard that song. But what did they do?
"Nor did they handle axe or knife To take away their victim's life -- No sooner done than in a chest They crammed their lately welcome guest."
Yes, Doctor.
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
A carriage overturned.  My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.
Perhaps -- a delicate operation -- an operation which has never been performed -- but it could be performed.  I'm sure it could be -- I could incise the columna dorsi --
Where are they?
What do they do that they had to kill her?
A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
Bitch killed herself when she shot a cop in the leg. If she' just acted like a girl nothing would have happened.  So you're right, spooky. Happy?
Who are you?
That locket you're holding. You have one just like it.
And he's right over there by the way.  What did you do to your face?
I told you, I knew your sister.
No. You don't.
Erin. I'll always be with you.
I want you... to bend over.
Don't call me that! Don't call me anything!
I'm never going back in that house again. Get away.
He'll be there at 8:30.
Yes, sir -- it certainly does!
We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... You see, we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years.  We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago.  So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves -- with your primitive tanks and planes -- we were unconcerned. But soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets. That, of course, we cannot tolerate.
That's what I came to see you about.
Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
Yes -- of course.
Hello, darling.  Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.
Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?
I -- I don't know, dear... Perhaps there's some mistake.
What do you mean, dear?
Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.
Yeah -- the grass was kind of wet.
Wouldn't you like to meet him?
Is it different where you've been?  Don't they have places like this?
Bet they're worth about a million dollars.
The President asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened. We all feel--
You must have a rather strange impression of us.
I can judge only by what I see.
Under the circumstances I'm afraid that will be impossible.
Well, we could--
You know how I feel, Tom. I just want to think it over.
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
I will be in just a minute.
Is it real?
You think it's all right for you to stay here?
I've got a good lock on my door.  And Bobby's going to sleep in my room tonight.
I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, that'll be fine. 'Bye.
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
I enjoyed every minute of it.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon, but he wasn't in. Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.
I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination.
Where is the meeting going to be?
But how -- how long--?
People get hysterical enough, they do anything.  Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.
Get going, will you, Brady -- before I get mad!
This one could save your life.
I'm gonna pray that I never need to call you.
Wears sunglasses in the <u>house</u>.
I've only got one question for you, and I want an honest answer.  Have you taken any human victims yet?
We are awesome monster-bashers!
If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.
For a ride.
Yeah.
Sorry, Michael.  No hard feelings, huh?  Here.  Try these noodles.
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
That is very probable.  What's your reasoning?
Max?  You men we're having company again?
It was a dream, Star.
No, Laddie.  It was a <u>memory</u>.
You better not like him too much.
I'll pass.
I watch him all day.  The only time I have more myself is at night.  Let Grandpa watch him.
Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
Michael!...
What's wrong?  Tell me.
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.
C'mere, Nanook.
Not funny, Sam!
-- I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!
Lucy.
-- a job.
You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job...
Burn??  Are you kidding?  It's freezing!
What?!  Did you know that!?
What do you mean?
I'm Michael.
I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
No.  They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
Let's go see them.
So do I!
I was here first.
Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
You're right... not even to mention you and me.
No.  Why?
The bottoms of your feet are covered with salt.
No.
What about Nonook?  What have you done to Nanook?!  What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
He was protecting <u>you</u>!
Look at your reflection in the mirror!!
The Marines.
Screw it, I'm going up anyway.
I've asked him to try and locate the site.  Okay with you?
Well... there's still some cell activity... it's not entirely dead yet.
I've got six dead Norwegians on my hands, a burned up flying saucer, and we've just destroyed the scientific find of the century.  Now fuck off!
No, you're not!  I don't trust any of you!
I don't know who to trust.
What?
No.  Just let him freeze out there.
You lying bastard...
Gee, thanks!
For your health.
Smart S.O.B.  He put it together piece by piece.
Neither will we.
Damn you, MacReady!
After all this mess then.
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
It'll come.  It needs us.  We're the only thing left to imitate...  Give me a hand.
Chance we got to take.  We got to force him to come down the east side to the door we got rigged.
Get your gear on.
Who else could have used that key?
MacReady, that you?
I'm training to be a high climber.
Exactly like you.  Well, maybe not as healthy.
I'm so sorry, Kalen.
I shouldn't have mentioned it.  We can't go there.
What kind of stories?
How did you know?!
I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi.
Excuse me?
It was meant to.
Do you know which way?
Nothing to do, I'm afraid.  I'm just a librarian after all.  Wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling.  Very Byronic end, though.  I appreciate that.  Do you know Byron?
Vox...
I should hope not...  ... Alexander... Make them read my books.  Tell them who they are. Who they could be.
Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
No, we created the Morlocks.
Does this prove something to you? Have you made some great stand of which I'm unaware?
Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
Let them.
I have something for you...
No, I'm all bowler hat, remember?
I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?
Then why are you here?
Do you find her?
You're dying here.  Don't you see that?!
Good night, Alex.
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
And your jewelry too.  I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.
For a time it was astounding.  I saw the years spinning by, I was in the years spinning by.  We made such advances.  I don't understand half of them.  There was a machine that talked to me and others that flew through the sky... We must have been incredible thinkers and artists --
Not like this... They don't seem so bright with all the city lights.  I never really noticed them much...
I can see Kalen's point.
What you need is an engineer.  If you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights, some basic block and tackle mechanism, you could to this a lot more easily.
What's it all for?
Did you have fires at night?
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
So you can use it now?
Go back to your own time?
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
Sir --
Because it's a new way of seeing the world!  Of seeing our place in it!
Dean Fulton...
Yes, sir.
Kalen...
And you've no idea where he went?
No, sir.
Then don't.
Yes.
Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.
[Beat] You're his son?
I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're haunting yourself right now. [Beat] I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. You didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out different, didn't it?
I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
They should just be looking harder.
I am. One of the few things I remember doing is eating. So I guess I must be exercising it off in my dreams.
[Beat] Thank you.
And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
Oh, yeah.
Why?
I'll leave. But look at me. Look at my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met you and your mother. I told you then that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There was no one for miles around so I know you know there's no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around.
After I...
It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...
Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D.
[Beat, lost] No.
[Beat] I don't know.
You're bleeding pretty bad there.
But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
Why would we do that?
2004.
No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from.
Why not?
William, that is just another facet of my delusions.
You told me this was how it happened.
I did?
Listen to me. That's all I ask.
Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
Why?
So what am I supposed to do?
[Beat] Thanks.
Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.
Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.
The best I could do with what was in your fridge.
[Beat] Real is overrated.
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
How?
Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.
I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
Honey.  Nothing's impossible.  You just don't shoot someone like that for no reason.  Maybe he was askin' for it.  Anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' Harlan.
That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
Well, you're not exactly an expert witness, but what makes you so sure?
Who do you think did it?
Alright, Lena.  Go on home.  We might have to call you in for some more questioning.
You girls are in some hot water.
Good.  You wanna tell me what happened?
You're still with us though.  You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
That's certainly possible.
Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.
Oh, definitely.
What's wrong?
It's okay.  He is an asshole.  Most of the time I just let it slide.
Thelma?  It's me.
Well, you wanna use the shower?
Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
Call me back.
That's the code word.  I miss you, peaches.
It's me.
Then what?!  What, goddamnit, Louise!  Where the fuck are you going?  Are you just leaving for fucking ever?  What, did you fuckin' murder somebody or what?!
As far as I'm concerned, yes, ma'am, you are.
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
'Cause I didn't ask him.
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
Well, just relax, will ya.  You're makin' me nervous.
I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're all upset.  It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess.  I wonder if Darryl's home yet.
Get the car!
What?  Oh, I don't know.  Let me look.
Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
No, Louise.  How come you never said what happened?
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!
Try to.
No physical evidence.  We can't prove he did it.  We probably can't even prove he touched you by now.
Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
Well, you got it now.
Nothing.  It's not funny.
Now, Thelma, that is not...
Yes.
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
We can change our names.
We've gone insane.
What?
Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.
No, I just meant...
That's great, Woogie, I'm happy you're better -- you seem... good --but... you put me through quite an ordeal, you know.
All right, I did, but I was in a weird place then.
What's he like?
Well why don't you look her up?
Why not?
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
I got it -- you hire a private eye, fly him out there, he follows her around a couple days, she'll never know a thing.
His mother?
Well... at least now you know.
Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.
Mary.
You got a brew?
Big time.
Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
Am I?
Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
The sawbones?
Not 'til you get about three hundred yards from the summit. That's been my experience anyway.
By the way, what's your name?
Are you... an architect?
Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card.
They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me.  Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing I have in this crazy old world.  Ooh, hey, I gotta run.
What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
Well, I'll see ya.
Any idea where I might start looking?
Well, I know you're busy...
No.
Really?  Very, very?
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?
Fucking sickening.
How do you guarantee that?
Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock.
No I'm not.
Good lookin'?
Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
Well... I've got a little more news about your friend Healy.
Who's that?
I like it. And think of the toppings -- cheese, mushrooms, mint jelly
Yeah?
We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
It?  Oh it. All right, these things happen, let me have a look. It's not the end of the world.
Shhhhhh!
No, that's really unneces --
I wasn't trying --
Uh-huh.
I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.
I'm gonna take a rain check.
Of course. Our pledge can be relayed to any government official Secretary Khruschev sees fit to satisfy.
What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.
We keep 'em in the dark as long as we can. But I sure as hell am going to test him.
Then you'll call, right?
Yeah, but the country didn't even exist as a country yet. It was a mess, and he didn't have a leg to stand on.
You mean there's something more important than votes? Didn't think I'd live to see the day, Ken.
Give it a rest. You were thinking the same thing, just didn't have the guts to take the heat.
So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.
That is correct.
An invasion...
Still heading for Cuba.
No. I'm glad I'm home.
I want an hour with him.
I said his heart, not his attention.
Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.
Yeah.
No way.
Maybe it's harder for them to say it than they let on. At the very least, they believe it's in our best interest. And at the end of the day, they may end up being right.
Oh, just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our Jupiter missiles in Turkey if the Soviets'll do the same in Cuba.
Yeah, a good political solution.
They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.
Hey. Nice tie.
Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.
They can lead us to Jimmy. Just let them go. We're tightening the net on him. We know he's on the reservation.
Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
-- did you understand me when I said that --
His mother needs a piece of his hair. It's for the Keeping of the Souls Ceremony.  Has to be kept for four days.
The agents who have worked out here say its like going into Nam. Unfamiliar terrain, foreign language, foreign customs... and you never know when you might walk into a few rounds. They hold a lot of old anger for the white man out here.
No. I consulted it. We're going into Indian Country, I wanna know what kind of individual is covering my ass. Don't you?
Let's see it.
I gave it back to her.
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
Ray. I never get into bed with somebody unless I know for sure. Just the way I was raised.
Thanks, Cooch.
He's out there. He's out there playing Sitting Bull with us. I want the motherfucker so bad I'm getting a bleeding ulcer.
-- Cooch. Woh. Stop.
Yes.
Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't believe it. I --
-- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
No way, Cooch.
Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area.
Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. I'm giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security.
He says he saw you in a vision some time ago.
He just did the Gettysburg Address in Sioux. What did he say?
Because he was talking to me.
She's your sister?
What's real to you? Wall Street? Capital Hill? Now they are myths.
Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
Ain't prayer flags, that's for sure.
What?
We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water.
You go to the council fire. I'm going back in.
You're the FBI. That's your job, isn't it? Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never saw any investigating then. Why now? What's going down here?
Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down.
Good.
They took it down, set fire to it, and threw it on the doorstep of room 13 at the Buffalo Butte Motel. Your room.
Get up!
Miles. Three other suits. That's all I know 'em as -- suits. Were you there?
Red Deer Table! What's with you, man?
You saw a MiG 21?
For what?
Is that all? CHARLIE What else do you want?
Too aggressive?
Give me a break, I'm asking you out.
Make what?

Winston Churchill.
Are you really that brave?
What?
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
What do you take me for? It's a Navy Cross.
Where'd you get it.
You don't have to do this.
That's what I want.
Of course the line's just imaginary. You can cross it twenty times...nothing really changes.
It does.
I sit. I think. I play games.
It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing.  One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.
The big one. The one that's most on your mind.
Sir. I was going Mach point one five.
Tomcats?
ROGER, COUGAR.  Okay boys, pull out with your hands up and nobody'll get hurt.
EVERYBODY'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE. ..NOW WE'RE RIGHT WITH YOU. YOU ARE INVERTED.  ROLL IT, COUGAR.
What?  What is it?
No! Now we're inverted!
It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
Don't tell me okay. Do it!
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, I've got it.
Is it you?
What do you want?
Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
Got you here.
We're here because we're the best flyers in the wing. Not because of some MiG encounter.
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
Right.
Come on, relax...
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
They should have warned you about that one.
What'd you do?
He's a hell of a flyer. In fact, he's so damn good he might have been picked for Top Gun himself. Except for one thing.  He just can't seem to follow orders!
Thirty seconds. That's all it took to blow us out of the sky.
STAY WHERE YOU ARE. HE'S MINE. I'M ENGAGED. I'M IN.
STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK.
Just below ten thousand.
COUGAR, THIS IS MAVERICK.  I'M GETTING HUNGRY, LET'S HEAD FOR THE BARN. ...COUGAR, WHERE ARE YOU?
Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.
ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
Why not?
Whatcha doin' to me, man?!  I got six kids to feed!
Hey, I got four kids to feed.
How'd you find me?
Thank you.
Who is it this time--my mother?
You're nothing!  You're nobody!  You're a stupid dream.  Well all dreams come to an end.
Who told you to think?!  I don't give you enough information to think!  You do what you're told!!  That's what you do!
Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!
I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy in there.
Ernie, dump him in a cab.  Around the corner.  Tiffany, you help him.  I'll destroy his file and refund his money.  And if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of Douglas Quaid.
I'm listening.
Arrest that woman!
We don't have much choice then, do we?
What, aliens?
C'mon!
A friend of mine tried one of their "special offers"...Nearly got himself lobotomized.
How was your trip to Mars?
Up to the right.
Level 2.  Galleria.
The door opened.  You got it.
Drive!  DRIVE!!
Poor baby.  This is getting to be an obsession.
But I'm always home by morning.
Yeah, sweetheart?
Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.  You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring!  --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.
All right, forget about it.
I know it sounds crazy, but I went to this Rekall place after work, and...
Oh God, Doug.
I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!
Bullshit.
I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference.  Guaranteed, or your money back.
Whatever you say...Just answer one question.  What is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken?
I think it's still hungry.
I guess he didn't.
I don't remember you.  I don't remember us.  I don't even remember me.
Not any more.
Oh, she isn't really your wife.  How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife.
What was I doing on Mars?!  Damn!
One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.
I don't know...  They're pretty quick...fifteen seconds?
Cannon fuse.
I'd vote for outer space.  No way those are local boys.
We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.
Well, I was wondering if we could...
The mountains are solid granite. We'd be safe there, and we could hike along them...all the way to Bixby if we have to.
He's only got one damn jacket. That's him, I'm telling you.
Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
You got that right.
I'll go with that plan.
Hey, I don't want spend the night out here!
I'm gonna help you.
Its tires are flat...
<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat.
Only if something happens to me.
You're not civil, you're glum.  We got the world by the tail with a downhill pull and all of a sudden you go glum on me.
She just practically asked you for a date.  What the hell is wrong?!
You don't get it, Pham.  The idea was: we were ripping you off.
Yeah, geography.
Where's the nearest hospital?
Sustained.
Your Honor: I imagine that, no matter how careful my questioning, Mr. Ortega would, in his well-intentioned way, dig my client's hole even deeper.
Shut your sewer mouth!
Not necessarily...
Your Honor, the witness' response was non-responsive... I ask you to strike it from the record...!
I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.
Damn right I'm right.
Hey. You plan to be a criminal defense attorney, know this going in: Everybody's guilty.
Look -- I'm tired, I'll see you in the morning, Eddie.
What, the lunatic who --
A spinal injury, in the line of duty. It was in Kitty's report...
-- Eddie...
Everyone else was wrong and the one fucking lunatic was right!
Least we'd already be at the Morgue.
... An hour.  That's why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town.
Eddie, I'm not working on this case. You boys have fun.
I lied.
I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
Y-yes, sir.
This and that.
Are you implying that my motives are less than sincere?
What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal.
You're pissing me off again, Ed.
Argumentative.
-- Objection, your Honor! This case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with!
I'd need a continuance. Three weeks at least.
Didn't this investigation, with its attendant publicity, catapult you into the office you now hold?
I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
You're trespassing into the area of witness protection, Mr. Dowd. Such showboating puts lives at risk.
...A soldado, he takes care of it.
And why was an exception made?
The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. The world is a hologram, Albert.
Tell me some other things about her.
Get lost Bobby.
Don't be late.
You killed Mike.
What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
Don't get funny with me again.
I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
Not a lot around here, no. Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls.
You are here and there is no place to go...
He's dead -- good and dead.
Sorry to hear it.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks
Any friends?
No.
Shorthand. Really?
He talks loud. And he loves his code.
Yes, it is good.  What do you think is in these other drawers?
Oh.
Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up there.
We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
Are you speaking to me in a code?
In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.
He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.
Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
If I can smoke it.
You know what that Big "E" stands for? Big Ed's Gas Farm.
Fill 'er up.
He wants to be me... or he will kill me.
Oh, yes... yes...
I already made you two tapes.
Hey, Jacques...
Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
We throw away the whole head.
Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland Palmer.
This is serious. Mr. Benjamin Horne's got a delegation of Norwegians coming in next week and I want both of you to learn to introduce yourself. Sarah, you first.
I can arrange that. I like that.
Who am I?
I don't know.
Don't worry, Shelly, I'll handle Leo.
Abrams...
Four cases in three years...
The man's an ambulance chaser...
All right. But let's keep the price down. I've called Ed Concannon. He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
Mickey told me to come back to work.
Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...
What does it mean?
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
Yes.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
Just as you are, Sir...
Through, through his book.
...of Anesthesiology?
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
I completely understand...
We just...
You ruined my life, Mister... Me and my wife... and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl. We been going four years.  Four years... my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
...apartment.  No, no. Please. You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
It's my opinion it took him much longer. Nine... ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.
The most respected...
Whose side are you arguing...? I thought that you wanted to do something. I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going to... I have an interest in the Hospital; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid. You caught 'em. Now: how many others did they kill?
You live in the neighborhood?
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
Yes.
Why is that?
I was held up.
...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
That's perfectly all right.
What?
Exception!
My name's Frank. And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
What happened...?
Isn't there something you...
That's not the question. It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault? If I'd... if I'd... I never should have taken it. There was no way that I was going to win.
No... no...
Missus...
Yes, we know that you do. I have it in my files. That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
It's locked?
A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anesthetic...
My doctor told me that I got to move out West... that's when we filed in court. We didn't want to sue...
Dr. Gruber's not in.
...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them...
That's the point, you stupid fuck. Let them buy it. We let them buy the case. That's what I took it for. You let this drop -- we'll go up to New Hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer...
I know what I said but not now. You won it. Franky. You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won. We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.
I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban Transport...
I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse?
So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.
You use their witness.
What did she do?
She didn't do anything. She took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
The 'History'...?
Because she was anemic.  It's right there on her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway...
A huge law firm. Okay? They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...' Okay...?
Huh.
Me, too.
Hey, how about that!
Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
It hit sideways and skidded in.
Well, I did a thesis on modern scien- tists - working for my Masters degree.
I didn't know how to stop you...!
Automobile ignitions are insulated.
No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
If they're mortal, they must have mortal weaknesses.  They'll be stopped -- somehow!
I feel like I did one time when I was small.  Awful scared and lonesome...I'd wandered off - I've forgotten why - but the family and whole crowds of neighbors were hunting for me.  They found me in a church.  I was afraid to go in any place else.
But you're not going to.  You're not the kind.  You're tired, anyway.  You've been up all night.  You cracked up in a plane.  Slept in a ditch.  But you want to know something?  It doesn't show on you at all.
It might give us something.
Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field phones are okay so far.
And they'll go out the minute there's another ray.  A cylinder reported down by Huntington Beach.  That's a job for the Navy.
That's because we want a chance to observe them.  This is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them.  What happens here will be a guide to all other operations. The minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops, I'll get my report to Washington.  You've deployed your forces well.
I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.
Welcome to California!
Come on.  Kids love horror.
We'll work something out.  I'm sure you'll be happy with it.
And since you've been thinking of making it.  Has anything funny happened?
Chase. Hi...
Sometimes what a child says or fantasizes will give a clue to what ails him.  Did he say anything while he was still lucid?
Say how they find their way back home.
Your bed?
It's in my family, you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...
You really think Dylan's okay?
John.  It's Heather.  I need help!
What are you talking about?
Yes?
The car's no there yet?
They wouldn't let me...
That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
But it was you that gave Nancy her strength.  So to get out he has to come through you.  And it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...
Choice?  What kind of choice?
No, not really.  I...
Coffee'd be nice.
Black's fine.
On the deck of the Yankee, the night you asked me to marry you.  We weren't much older than they are.
Phil, he's not looking inside.  He's just striking out at the world.
She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."
Give me some time to Blow the man down!
Good.  Let's go sailing.
Well, that's all part of it.
Everybody down!  ON THE DOUBLE!!
Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit.
You're not a moron.
Figured what out?
I'll tell you who you are.  You're the glue.  You're the thing that holds everybody around you together. You're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't.  It's a gift.
I feel like... we can do anything.
Why then.
He does.
We all have problems.
No, I didn't.
Maybe it's an air raid.
Fine.
Kennet Square, PA.  'Mushroom capital of the world'.
What are you talking about.
Face what?
You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall.  Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight.
Of a fight he can't win out here.
They have every right Chuck.
I don't know.
You know the best thing about being a Skipper is the worst thing.  It's all my responsibility.  So I'll tell you what George, you stay off of my bridge, and I'll stay out of your galley.  We'll get along that way.
And being sixteen.
They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
We'll think of something.
Why would you do that?
I figured it out.
I don't have to listen to this.
Terry left his passport in Curacao. We could hide him...
Joy, rapture...
For killing a dolphin.
... and that you invited him to strike you?  To fight it out on the deck of your ship?!
The Coast Guard 'Eagle'.  She never lost a race while you were Skipper.
... Absolutely not.
The papers are going to eat you alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  They want someone to be accountable.
Why? He's right in the groove.
I didn't hate me so much, I'd feel better wishin' you luck.
Y'all take American Express?
How old are you?
Twenty.
Say it!... I'LL TEAR YOUR FUCKIN' HEART OUT, GIRL... Say "fuck me" soft - then I'll leave. Say "fuck me"... Whisper it... Then I'll leave... Say it... Say it - Say it - Say it...
That'd be fine, Bobby.
Be easy, Sailor. There's two employees. I take one in the back to open the safe, you keep the other'n covered... You ain't plannin' on raisin' a fam'ly in Big Tuna, are ya?
What is it?
Told ya I would. You still riled?
What's the name of it?
Club Zanzibar.
Thanks.
Whattaya do there?
But I am also with the government.
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance.
She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor.
But I'm wild at heart.
Why not? How was the fishin'?
Hasta siempre.
You're just jealous of Santos cause he's sweet on me.
How'd she sound? Was she doin' okay?
Could she be doin' okay, Johnnie? She's tryin' to prove somethin' to me, that's all. Lula ain't doin' no more'n showin' off, defyin' me...  Johnnie, I've done somethin' bad...
Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.
And to think what coulda happened in that king-sized bed tonight...
See ya downstairs.
My daddy ain't never killed nobody, has he, mama?
Peanut...
In a fire, as I recall.
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
That woman's laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin' like that... somewhere before... Sound'd like the wicked witch...
That don't seem fair.
Wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?
I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.
Hell, peanut...
Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.
You up for that?
I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.
You're excitin' me, honey. What'd she do?
It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
They sure do stink.
You ain't gonna begin worryin' about what's bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin' state lines with a A-Number One certified murderer.
Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer. Don't exaggerate.
What kinda trash talk is that?
It's huge. This musta been a grand old place at one time.
We sure don't, honey...  Get me a Mounds?
Ever imagine what it'd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast? Sometimes I think it would be the biggest thrill?
You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey?
It wasn't no fun, Lula. The wind was blowin' super-hard and I wasn't dressed warm. Only instead of freezin', I was sweatin' strong.
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
Where?
Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?
Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.
You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
We all got a secret side, baby. Hope you don't think I been lyin' to you 'bout other things, sugar.
Well, we're really out in the middle of it now, ain't we?
If you say so.
I do trust you, Sailor. Like I ain't never trusted nobody before.
I don't know... Looks like clothes.
Not quite as bad as the weather though... It must be a hundred and ten and it ain't even noon yet.
No radio or TV...
A little, I think... Darlin'?
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
So where'd you say you was?
Boys frightened, Lula. This ain't no good.
He ain't never known me, Lula, so there ain't much for him to forget. Not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too.
I'll bet.
Right?! Mama, was it right for you to sic Johnnie Farragut on us? How could you do that?
No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!
Argentina! Lula, you're outta your mind. Now you just tell me where you are and I'll come for you. I won't say nothin' to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants, I don't care.
I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
What if I told you not to?
You need to explain it.
Yes.
On one condition...
You fucker, don't you ever touch Lula - You fucker, I'll kill you.
My very best to Johnnie... Bless his soul.
Please Santos... Where's Johnnie?
What?...
Whattya mean?
Life is unpredictable.
Is there a contract?... We made a deal once that we'd tip each other off if we ever heard.
Yeah. Like in Against All Flags. Only they use a couple big hams.
Perfect. Well then, shall we?
Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, Tripp. But...  ...I get pressure. Know what I mean?
Sara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.
He finished it Winter Break.
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
Where would we go?
Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
Nevertheless. There's a police officer standing on the porch and I don't think he's going away.
There is no problem. Did I say there was a problem?
Evidently.  Coming!
Call it a hunch.
It's cool, Jeff. Really.
Yea?
Heaven?
I had to. Didn't I?
What are we going to do with...
Miss Sloviak's.
Mmrrmmm... KNAP SAP!
Washed up?
Well done, James.
Jesus, James. Wow.
Where's that?
Your father worked in a mannequin factory?
Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my mom. She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before that, she'd been a dancer.
Probably about the time you gave me the codeine pills last night.
I never said that.
What would you call them then?
I don't know... 'Episodes.'
I eat.
I think maybe we're missing the point. It seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us. That takes... courage.
And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.
Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?
Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.
I got the message you called too.
That's funny. I need to talk to you, too.  Perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?
I think I might have.
I know.
Does he still love you?
James is... I don't know...
Tony. Now that I'm home.
Grady?
GRADY Tripp. English Department.
I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
I... I...
Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office Monday morning.
Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.
I was thinking of you.
It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you know that. It's a young man's book. It got me remembering how it felt to be young.
The perpetrator.
I might have his number on campus.
Pills. August 25, 1972. In a Costa Brava hotel room.
Just a few then. The big ones.
Foreman now.
You find me a decent place for under three hundred a month in this town, and I'll happily move out of this crap neighborhood.
You're the only one in the family who still talks to me.
I made that table for you and Annette, for your wedding. I put a lot of love into it.
Ah, come on.
Annette will see you.
When?
Soon.
You're a good man, Walter. Okay, you did some wrong things, but inside you're a good, decent man.
When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.
How does it sound?
I can't.
I have to go.
Not yet.
I'm not pretty.
Got something to hide?
I could get a search warrant.
Like a piece of shit? In my eyes, you are a piece of shit. Think anyone would miss you if I threw you out the window right now? I could say you jumped when I came in. Who are they going to believe? Not you, because you'd be a dead piece of shit.
You going to take me on a nature walk?
I fell asleep.
What?
I count my blessings.
I will be in three months.  I can't wait. I hate being eleven. It has to be the stupidest age in the world.
Robin?
They could be finches. I don't know. We should go before it gets dark.
Robin, listen to me.
Yes?
Do I take "okay" to mean you feel good about working there?
That was a joke.
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
That's right.
I'm not that crazy.
We have a lot of work to do.
How do they know?
You mean my problem?
What?
Why?
I'm relaxed.
In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
Nothing.
Okay I'll tell you what I did -- just to shut you up!  I smelled her hair.
Me?
I thought you were a dyke.
Yeah, they could.
You don't really --
And what do you tell yourself now?
Bullshit.
All three -- in chronological order.
Us seeing each other.
Maybe you should be.
Move in with me.
Do what?
Why's it always my fucking problem?
Yeah.
Wasn't up to me.
Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.
You're right, Bud.  It was just that simple. Aren't you clever?  You should get your own show... Ask Dr. Bud, advice to the lovelorn from three hundred fathoms.
I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
What do you think he saw?
What about O-2?
I'm telling you what is there.  You're just not hearing.  The impulses somehow aren't getting from you ears to your brainpan.  There's something down there.  Something not... us.
Maybe their whole technology is based on that. Controlling water.
You noticed.
They'll come out after us.
What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You got it on, keep it on.
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??
Let's go, guys.
God, I hate that bitch.
Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?
Now we're right in the middle of this big-time international incident.  Like the Cuban Missile Crisis or something.
Got it. Over.
Meet me in the moonpool.  Move fast.
Yuh?
I can't... make it... podner.
Missed what?
Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving.  We're on a tight timeline.
Gotcha, Cab Three.  Who is that?  That You, Lindsey?
We got Russian subs creeping around.  Shit! Something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here, man.  Give our folks medals, know what I mean?
What kind of luminous things, Bud?
Bud, it's the pressure.  Try to concentrate. Concentrate on my voice.  Just listen to my voice.
I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily...
There you go... Must you always spoil everything!
No, Dad, it isn't.
Without any doubt, sir. If anything belonging to the girl who has run away is still here on this island...
I understand very well. Only I don't want any rash assumptions to be made.
At what?
But of course... arrogant, haughty... Hasn't Anna ever told you?
But then when will we see each other?
Who knows why they all left...
Don't think that I want to save myself from any embarrassment, from the awkwardness of meeting Anna... It's not that; it's that you can say certain things easier if you're alone. Please, Sandro, do try to understand me... It would look like I was trying to influence you, to force you, to control you... and that makes me feel uncomfortable...
And why did you drop them?
Okay. In a few minutes.
Nothing.
Better dead.
I would say he's pretty depraved.
Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out?
To do what?
Do you consider that a compliment?
But then why did you bother changing?
Quieter? Oh, yes, of course.
But what's gotten into you?... We would have known. Sandro must be out in the garden somewhere, taking a breath of fresh air, or watching the break of dawn. It would be a lovely surprise indeed if he turned out to be the sentimental type.
Please, do come... Don't leave me alone with him. He's capable of... I don't know... Have you noticed his eyes?
But Corrado...  If something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?
When one approaches fifty, my dear, he is affected only by the cold.
Me?... I no longer have any interest in building... And, then, where can you find boulders of rock like this in Milan?
So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
I was saying... it might even be possible that Anna had left with them.
Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
You men are all so dreadful!
Why don't you try?
Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too.
Now, we're getting somewhere! They're beginning to contradict each other.  Now look here, your friend just swore to me that you weren't able to do any fishing at all because the sea was too rough... And what about the other boat?
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
What boat?
And how come you're up so early?
Yes, we will.
Oh, no, not at all. And then you know very well that he'll forgive you anything; just as long as you admit to him that you're a worse driver than he is...
Yes. Until proven otherwise.
No, I'm not. Why do you think she does all this? It's one of the many ways she can put herself on display. When you bait the trap, the mouse will snap. To tell you the truth,  if it wasn't for the fact that one hundred thousand lire represents my whole month's salary, well... But you had something you wanted to ask me?
Now listen, if I had any information, I wouldn't have come here to ask you. But I see that you, too, lack any information ...
Is that possible?
She'd punish me.
One of the other Sisters?
Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where...
God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said...
Then tell me. Where are your sheets?
I just heard you.
I don't know.
Yes.
Everyone.
I don't know.
Do you remember the night they said it came?
Something I ate.
Down... there.
I got sicker.
After God... before the waste-paper basket.
Are you married?
I can't have them any more.
No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?
Oh, it's even more wonderful then.
A mistake... it was a mistake...
Only you think you're lucky because you didn't have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe weren't always nice but that was because of me, because I was bad, not her.
She's dead isn't she?
Yes.
Agnes, you're stupid.
Did you know what was going to come out?
Did you want it to come out?
Will she be angry?
What do you feel?
I have to throw up...
They can't hear me that's why.  Oh God... I don't wanna...
Frightened.
Do you remember what just happened?
Yes.
Why?
For what he made me go through.
Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's alright to hate him.
I put her to sleep.
H... how?
The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us.
And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be?
I don't believe this. I don't bloody believe this.
Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
Who are you?
Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
No-one.
Who was the father?
Why haven't you asked her?
Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here.
I am not with the Inquisition.
Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
And in your eyes?
I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
Oh, dear God.
She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone.
Become?  One is born a saint.
Listen to her singing.
This is insane.
You're saying God did it?
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
Yes.
The scandal...
She didn't want any help.
Wasn't it!
Yes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddy's son of 'em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. "Mister, can you spare us a copper?" he said. I was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler ... So, I took them under me managerial banner.
All right, take your hoop and bowl.
I'm a deserter.
Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come with us but they chickened.
They'll be here.
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
No, I know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins.
Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.
I beg your pardon?
Have I said something amiss?
But your Grandfather lives in your house. I've seen him.
You're getting out of hand. I don't know what's come over you today.
I'll look in here again.
I've got you worried, haven't I?
D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
Are you pulling my leg?
No.  I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.
Yes.
But the way you did it then sounded so phony.
I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
And you honestly think that's what she meant?
Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.
Parading?
At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!
What are they saying?
He can talk then?
Oh, well that's all right.  What?
Why do you always use your left hand?
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
Don't mock the afflicted, Pauly.
Well, it may be a joke, but it's his nose. He can't help having a horrible great nose, it's the only one he's got. And his poor little head's trembling under the weight of it.
We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.
Oh yes, he's clean all right.
Oh, that one. That's me Grandfather.
Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
Now, look here, Norm ...
What?
Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...
No, not me.
Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.
Y'what?
I don't need you to defend me, y'know, Norm.
Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.
I know, that's the trouble.
Shurrup, cheerful.
Well ... if he's your Grandfather, who knows?
Yeah, It's all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. He's probably in the middle of an orgy by now.
Oh, a little savage, is he?
... I don't know...
Sandy, scan the whole sky.
There are no commercial lanes out here.  Face it, we're out of range.
Is it solid?
Martin, we're going in.  I'm going to hold the conversation to a minimum from here on.
No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
Don't you remember?
God I'm hungry.
Well, get started.
Right.  Talk to you.
What?
Not <u>they</u>... <u>he</u>...
What do you mean?
You know what they make this stuff out of?
Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em.
Damn it!  How long to fix?
Right.
I hope not.
All right -- Roby and Melkonis will go with Faust.  Hunter and I will make up the second team.
Right. 
It wouldn't come.
Maybe we can catch it.
Yes.
<u>How</u>?
What we really need is some red meat in here for bait.
Just can that crap!  I'm in command here till Chaz returns!  And nobody's leaving this ship!
And right next to it, that oval design with the markings -- it's a dead ringer for the spore casings.
Sandy, can you home in on that beam?
That creature sure must have considered it important... using his last strength to draw it...
I couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
Can you see anything?
What is it?
I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen.
Come on -- let's go above and see how they're coming with the gear.
Are they close?
Look --
Close...
About four hours.
Any microorganisms?
Good.  I'm getting you clear too. Let's just keep the line open.
I agree.  This is the single most important discovery in history.
I don't even know what I'm looking for.
We're coming up now, open the outer lock door.
With great pleasure.
We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
Now what?
Can we get to him?
No such luck.  I saw it running down one of the corridors.
Okay.  First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.
Here, carry these.
Is it dead?
No, it's still breathing.  Kinda clammy though.  Are you sure your stick's not broken.
God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.
I told you we... what's that?
Okay, give me the numbers.
We're not gonna make it, are we?
Has anybody talked to them?
Not yet.
We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.
I dunno.
Forget it, man.
Fuck the bonus.  I hate heights.  You wouldn't get me up there even if it wasn't night.
It's alright, it's cool...
York just turned up outside.  We're trying to get him into Infirmary.
Sounds great.
What's the problem?
She was running a little sluggish on the way back.  Think the turbines might be playing up.
Well... try the headset.
How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
Four.
What is this?  'Twenty Questions'?
'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?
Ah, don't worry about I.C.C.  They're the least of your problems right now.
What do you mean?
What do I think?  I think if those Marines from Powell don't shift their butts getting here, we're gonna get caught up to our necks in the middle of something we shouldn't.
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
You got it, cowboy.
It wasn't meant to be.
Lloyd. I never have any, and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish - so he sent it up...
That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
You have no right to say such things!
I don't know what I take you for anything...
Yes, you did. You still do.
- it's important right now that we talk. Killer to killer.
Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.
I can't believe my ears...
A dull cliche.
Belong - to you? That sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama...
I was there, I saw you and heard you through the dressing room door!
I don't think I'm going.
Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.
That's how you met me. In passing.
Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.
What makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair?
I do not. How do you do?
It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
It wasn't reading, it was a performance. Brilliant, vivid, something made of music and fire...
Geniuses don't need good luck.  I do.
Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at ten-  - and you're going to be on time.
Huh?
I leave in a week - the picture's all wrapped up, we previewed last night... those previews. Like opening out of town, but terrifying. There's nothing you can do, you're trapped, you're in a tin can-
I'll check with Eve...
Remind me to tell you about when I looked into the heart of an artichoke.
Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...
Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...
What a body, what a voice.
You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
I didn't know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!
I've been aware of that for some time.
Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.
But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?
You've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me... Margo, tell me what's behind all this.
You know what I'm going to be?
A married lady.
A foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady... that's for me. And no more make believe! Off stage or on... remember, Lloyd.  I mean it, now. Grown-up women only, I might even play a mother - only one child, of course, not over eight...  Lloyd, will you promise not to be angry with me?
Why you have to go out there.
You shouldn't have had any doubts.
So am I.
When you told me that whatever I became, it would be because of you-
Only thing, what I go after, I want to go after. I don't want it to come after me.
Of course!
Oh, brother.
Something maybe grew a size bigger.
You're not being funny, I could get actors for less. What about the food?
That spilled drink is going to ruin your carper.
No, I'd be imposing on her, I'd be just another tongue-tied gushing fan...
Eve. Eve Harrington.
Not at all.  Margo, this is Eve Harrington.
I think I'd better. It's been - well, I can hardly find the words to say how it's been...
Hollywood.
I think she would cheer.
But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
No, Eve, I won't forget...
Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
I don't intend to be.
Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison.
I wish I'd never met him, I'd like him to be dead... I want my friends back.
If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would.
You talk just as Addison said you did.
Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night...
During your second act scene with your father, Roger Ferraday's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch. He's been coming closer down every night...
When he gets too close, I'll spit in his eye.
Well, you've done so much... what's new?
The curtains. I made them myself.
They are lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?
I can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself?
- and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.
Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
Yes, I guess you were. It - it was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
Some snowy night in front of the fire... in the meantime, while we're on the subject, will you check about the hors d'oeuvres? The caterer forgot them, the varnish wasn't dry or something...
Thank you, Eve. I'd like a Martini - very dry.
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
Hi.  "Well, now Mis' Channin', ah don't think you can rightly say we lost the wah, we was mo' stahved out, you might say - an' that's what ah don' unnerstand about all these plays about love-stahved Suth'n women - love is one thing we was nevah stahved for the South!"
Be brave. He'll come back - with or without gas.
It doesn't matter.
Why should he - and why should you?
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
Loud.
Incredible.
She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo...
It strikes me that Eve's disloyalty and ingratitude must be contagious!
That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!
Did Miss Harrington tell you to call Mr. Richards?
Old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth!
It seems almost inconceivable that I haven't seen her backstage, but with so many people loitering around... well, well. So Eve is not working for Max after all-  - Max you sly puss.
I'm sure.
That's beside the point.
It's about time the piano realized it has not written the concerto!
It's not important whether you do. We are wearing long underwear.
We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
Play it again.
But that was the fourth straight time.
No. You're just crazy about "Liebestraum."
I feel right now like there's one burning in me.
Anything to help you out, Max.
That's my Max.
--it was bullshit the way it was--
---fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at CREEP--
It was there. I just don't get it; a CREEP secretary being scared, that's one thing. But what does the wife of one of the most powerful men in America have to be afraid of...?
And I'm a Republican.
--for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip--  --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing.
That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--
What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
It's nothing personal, though. 
What's the matter?
--he said John Haldeman, not Bob Haldeman--
Hmm?
What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means?
--jeeeeeeesus--
Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.
--so?
--goddamnit, when's somebody gonna go on the record on this story--
--it makes the break-in real--it's a major goddamn story--  --I'm not going to kick ass over this, but I'd like you to know I hate getting beat, I just hate it-- don't forget that I hate it--
Absolutely--
--what about you?--
Five hundred; six maybe.
You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl?
Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
Think Sloan's being set up as a fall guy for John Mitchell? Sometimes it looks that way.
Something maybe big.
We were never told flat out "Don't talk." But the message was clear.
Well, they sure didn't ask us to come forward and tell the truth.
Kalmbach--Nixon's personal lawyer.
--my wife just had the baby, my in- laws are arriving, I'm trying to get the house in some kind of shape.
--all non-denial denials--we're dirty guys and they doubt we were ever virgins but they don't say the story is inaccurate.
My non-denial denial.
It's not that we're using unnamed sources that bothers me, or that everything we print the White House denies, or that almost no other papers are reprinting our stuff.
Ben, Jesus, there are over two thousand reporters in this town, are there five on Watergate? Where did we suddenly get all this wisdom?
You saying the Democrats bugged themselves?
How senior?
--what do you think?--
Mitchell started the cover-up early, everyone is involved in the cover- up, all the way to the top. The whole U.S. intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities. The extent of it is incredible.  And people's lives are in danger, maybe including ours.
Clearly, I am here, but only as an individual, I'm not the attorney of record.  Mr. Rafferty has that position. Whatever you want, you'll have to get from him, I have nothing more to say.
Look, I told you inside--
Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars.
Are you implying you don't believe me?
...check...?
Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything?
Follow the money. Always follow the money.
I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.
Who?--be specific. How high up?
Mitchell knew then.
You'll have to find that out, won't you?--
Will you step forward, sir. 
I think so.
When will you be, do you think?-- when are we going to know it all?
You've never told anyone who he is?  But you'd have to tell me if I asked you.  Tell me.
Lotsa hints--
I would liken your query to being in Russia half a century ago and asking someone, "I understand who Lenin is and Trotsky I got too, but who's this yokel Stalin?"
Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--
No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
-- Thanks, coach --
Sure.
I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?
Yep.
You'll see.  Gotta go.  Sixteen minute round trip.
Come on!  I won't tell.
Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk.
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
Well, State's got a good business school.  And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
You mean...and orgasm?
Of course.
No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
Did you guys hook up or something?
No, "Charming" is old.  "Older" is <u>really</u> old.  "Youthful mind" is dead.
You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?
Went home to shit.
I don't get it.  How does a guy like that get this sudden reputation?
Just in time.
Come on, Jim.  Where are you?
You're not...busy?
Do you know about the clitoris?
Okay, well that about covers it.
Dad!!
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
I told you.
Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
She's a mermaid, dude.
C-Span?
So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?
After getting laid?
Did you see that Central chick? Brunette?
Okay.
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
Oh yes.  Very arousing women.  They arouse me very much.  But not as arousing as you.
You think so?
You got in.
Okay, don't stop.
I think "shithead" really says it.
Shhhh.  Your parents are downstairs.
No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
Yes --
Kevin...  I want to have sex with you.
It did.
Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
Have you ever heard of the bible?
Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
Then where does a blowjob figure in?
Observe.
Attitude?  Me?  I think that <u>you</u> guys should be more enthusiastic.  Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for.  We're in this together. Don't back out on me now!
Yeah right.  I got an idea for something new.  How 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Thanks.
Doing what?
Oh give me a break! He could use pills back in America! Why not get a little culture?
Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
If you leave it for more than a few minutes it locks up. Now I must reboot and type a dozen fucking passwords. He was security crazy.
Fine. My mistake. You know, I'm gonna be a writer myself some day.
And who's Claude?
Come on. I'm from New York - the "shoot me" state. Don't wait up.
You must get out of here. It's not safe.
Yeah... Ditto. I saw, er, I thought I saw you get munched... like Uncle Terrence...
I know! Let's go hock loogies off the Eiffel Tower!
It's okay. I can see fine.
Are you okay?
A cure?
Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.
Shut up! You fucking shut up! What do you want? Huh? What the hell do you want?
Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off.
Bullshit! You're bluffing!
And you call me a moron...
Why isn't it doing anything!?
That's not all...  Marcel - Officer Boulard was following you.
Terrence and I came down here to do serious work. For centuries these tunnels have been home to subcultures mainstream society would not tolerate.
Yeah, well if I claw my face off, just pack it in ice, okay? Jesus... the cops were probably right. My uncle was messed up with a bunch of fry brains and they went berserk on him.
Yes. I was able to decode the old texts and give Terrence the specifications. It took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: Adenine Di-Methyloxide. ADM. I call it ADAM. But just before he was attacked, he hid it...
I went to St. Severin church.  Now look -
AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH!
Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
Good man. Now can I have my arms back?
Yes sir.
Right. Little twerp thinks he's Colombo.
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
What were you showing her?
No.  I'm running <u>to</u>.
Not you. Him.
Poor Meetoo!
That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs  ... stretch then that way.
Hey! It doesn't matter! You gotta make your own way in the world! Don't be sorry for me! I'm going to get what I want don't you worry!
Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
Don't be
No! Well, yes, but
I'm glad you	did too.
No, no child... shush... it's all right ...
No, not about the ceremony, Anastasia - do you understand the choice you must make.
I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
How do you know?
Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
Are you feeling all right?
The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia...
You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
No. Empress, you --
That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
She does.
Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
You were on... uh, the... uh, the Johnny Carson, right?
Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break. Jesus Christ!
It's for my brudder.  Alvy Singer! Hey! This is Alvy-
All the good meetings are taken.
Who are you?
Alvy.
Two hours? No, u-uh, I'm going in. I'm going in.
I mean, you've been married before, you know how things can get. You were very hot for Allison at first.
Oh, that's right. That you really like those New York girls.
I don't...  I don't... Geez, I don't know, I've... I wa- This... yeah, I got this VW out there...  What a jerk, yeah. Would you like a lift?
Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.
No, Chippewa Falls.
Uh, you're driving a-
Huh?
I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?
Jesus, my-my grammy... n-never gave gifts, you know. She-she was too busy getting raped by Cossacks.
Hey, well, listen... hey, you wanna come upstairs and, uh... and have a glass of wine and something? Aw, no, I mean... I mean, you don't have to, you're probably late and everything else ...
Neat, yeah.
Well, who's Sadie?
Sadie? Oh, well, Sadie...  Sadie met Grammy through, uh, through Grammy's brother George. Uh, George was real sweet, you know, he had that thing. What is that thing where you, uh, where you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a sentence, you know-what is it? Uh...
Fifteen years, huh?
Yeah.
It's terrific.
What?
And-and uh, there's gonna be all that tension. You know, we never kissed before and I'll never know when to make the right move or anything. So we'll kiss now we'll get it over with and then we'll go eat. Okay?
Yeah.
Yeah... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a pastrami on white bread with, uh, mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce.  Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you and, uh, were you depressed about that?
As Balzac said...
Yeah?
M'hm.
You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know it's small.
It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.
C-c-coll- College audiences are so wonderful.
"Neat"! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."
That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got... nothing like that in-
I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
Will it change your wife?
Oh.
There's a spider in the bathroom.
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
Alvy, you're a little hostile, you know that? Not only that, you look thin and tired.
I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter?
Oh, uh, I don't know. I miss you. Tsch.
Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?
I don't know.
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
What thing?
Don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were-
I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
It's that they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows.
We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause... Right.
Oh, Alvy, come on.
You're mad, aren't you?
I thought just earplugs.
Can I confess something?
I did.
Why are you so hostile?
Is that Paul Goodman? No. And be nice to the host because he's publishing my book. Hi, Doug! Douglas Wyatt. "A Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of- the-Heart."
What's fascinating is that it's physical. You know, it's one thing about intellectuals, they prove that you can be absolutely brilliant and have no idea what's going on. But on the other hand...  the body doesn't lie, as-as we now know.
I can't.
My head is throbbing.
Oh, you got a headache!
Well, I'm-I'm gonna take another in a series of cold showers.
You catch Dylan?
You have a raccoon?
I can think of another word.
Uh, oh, I don't know. It might have been Leopold and Loeb.  Hello. Oh, hi... Uh, no, what-what's the matter? What-what-what? You sound terrible... No, what- Sure I- Whatta yuh what kind of an emergency?... No, well, stay there. Stay there, I'll come over right now. I'll come over right now.  Just stay there, I'll come right over.
What are you depressed about?
This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh... Bob and Petronia.
Ah, Max, you, uh...
Yeah, well, I used to lose my glasses a lot.
What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.
Max, I've got a hit series.
Oh, Jesus.
How about a ginger ale?
Oh, Max... no, I maybe I better lie down.
Where?
V.P.L.?
Yeah. I had the feeling that I got you at a bad moment. You know, I heard high-pitched squealing.
She was stealing.
How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?
Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
Oh, yes, yes.
I just have time to get the, uh-
Well, hi!
Uh, well, I'd like to talk to you about that sometime, if you get a chance.
Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey.
It was a wonderful set.
Yeah.
It has your ring.
And you've only just met.
Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and...  The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?
The camera loves her.  A great actress.
The movie.
I don't know what's going on.  I don't care to guess.  Mac's really unhappy. She isn't there, that's all.  She's no idea what she's playing, not a clue.
Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting?
I'm in mourning.
I...wait, what are you talking about?
Of course.
What?
Why didn't you bring him?
I'll change back before we leave.
And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.
Oh my God, the sitter.
Yeah.
It's not a contest.
I never put myself in harm's way.
What a nose.  You missed your calling.
Can I open it?
It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
Shit, I forgot to call her back.  She's off on a trip somewhere.  Oh God, my grandad's flat in London's been sold.
You're crazy baby.  I love you.
Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors?
Not as a rule.
Are you always this much fun?
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
Did he promise?
Hardly...
I think you're the most beautiful woman in the world.
You didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you?
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
Skye!  I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's our sixth, actually.  You read the book again?  Well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again.  If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers State Park.  Three blocks west of that, you want to hang right.  It's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left.
Really?
And Joe's huge in Europe.  He's like a rock star in London.  His novels sell millions.
Whatever!  You know how he gets.  Well, he went absolutely bonkers.  Lucy and I were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more. It was almost fatal.  And that, my dear friends, is the day...
She left the fucking gate open.
Otis!!!!
Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door.  It was done.
Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it.  But I guess that's what I interrupted.
About me!
What are you saying?
Mac?  Mac says it?  Cal?
Anyone else?
You're not ready.
That's under lock and key.
Sure.
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you read the new Styron?
Don't I find what?
I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long...
Mmm hmmm.
Thanks, Mac.  And thanks for being so supportive about all this.  I really love you, you know.
Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do.
Right away.  Are you sure you wouldn't like something soft, Ryan?
You're an interior decorator, right?
Uh-huh.
Hm.
We're way past inappropriate.
Lemon it is.
That's a lot of those.
I like you.
It was a mistake.  This isn't a plot to do in Otis.
Time!
You need a good review and you'll be fine.  The whole color of the world will change, mark my words.
Don't go in, Ryan.
Sally?
I'm so sorry.
Not at all.
Yeah.
Are you asking me to marry you?
Very.
Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.
You don't know she's a bitch.
How?
Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
I wasn't finished.
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
You're a shit.
Yes.  Fine.
I never like to talk about my work.
Oh you know.  No doubts.  No second thoughts.  Am I a monster?
That's not an answer, is it?
You don't need to thank me.
Panes is not on my team anymore.  I'll have Panes if I like.
Rose.
I'll be right out.
And she was saying how happy you were to finally have them over.  Because you're both, so, what - introspective?  And you should have done it ages ago.  I'm Sophia Gold.  Come meet my husband, Cal.
A notch above the storage room.
Oh Soph...
Oh honey, let's.
Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
Why are you doing this?
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
I'm new...I was born yesterday.
Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
Are you asking me out to dinner?
Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
Because...because he's <u>twice</u> the ant that you are.  I could <u>never</u> go through with marrying you.  I'm -- I'm an <u>individual</u>, and when I get married, it'll be to someone <u>I</u> choose.
SSHH!!!  SSHH!!!
Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
That's not a name!  That's just a letter!
Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
Well...no, but --
Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. "Insectopia".
You did?
Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
Yes...he's wonderful...
Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
Don't get all sappy about it!
No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
Look, General!  A darling baby soldier!  Don't try to be a hero!  Just make sure you come back in one piece!  Next!
'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.
Alright, let's move out!
Right!  Ants!  Millions of creatures, each with his assigned task, all pulling together!
Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
What do I do?
That's sweet.  That's real sweet.
I didn't really do anything -- honest -- I mean, you take a girl out a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're serious -- marriage-wise.
What did I tell you?
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
Good night.
Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
Sure.
I thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then --
Meet you in the lobby. Okay?
Oh.
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
Three.
Well, as long as you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me -- how about the three of us going out this evening -- you and me and the bowler -- stroll down Fifth Avenue -- sort of break it in --
This is a bad day for me.
That's right.  I told you we had a fight -- that's what it was about -- Miss Olsen -- you know that other girl you saw --
It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that I got here in time -- and you're going to be all right --  -- isn't she, Doc?
I'm so tired -- DR. DREYFUSS Here -- drink this.
I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --
Let me help you.
My head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. What time is it?
Sure I do. It's always nice to have company for Christmas.
No -- I don't want anything.
I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
And where are you now?
His apartment?
Oh, you're wrong. He told me --
Sure.
Why do people have to love people, anyway?
A bad insurance risk?
Gin.
So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
Was he really upset when you told him?
No doubt about it.
Miss Kubelik, I don't think that's such a good idea.
I don't like myself very much anyway.
Well, things are a little disorganized around here.
As a matter of fact, I'm a pretty good cook -- but I'm a lousy housekeeper.
You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.
Some people take, some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it.
You ought to see my backhand.  And wait till I serve the meatballs. 
I told you all along. You see, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
I was sort of wondering what you looked like. Sit down.
In 1957, we had an employee here, name of Fowler. He was very popular, too. Turned out he was running a bookie joint right in the Actuarial Department tying up the switchboard, figuring the odds on our I.B.M. machines -- so the day before the Kentucky Derby, I called in the Vice Squad and we raided the thirteenth floor.
Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.
Are you going to deny it?
The reason I called is -- I won't be home for dinner tonight. The branch manager from Kansas City is in town -- I'm taking him to the theatre Music Man, what else? No, don't wait up for me -- 'bye, darling.  Tell me something,  Baxter  -- have you seen Music Man?
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.
Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
Yeah.  You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her --
I got kicked in the head, too.
The only thing is I'm staying at the Athletic Club -- and it's strictly stag so if you don't mind --
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
Especially not Miss Kubelik.
I dig.
No I didn't.
But this is the key to the executive washroom.
Yes?
Who else?
A lot of guys around here have tried it -- all kinds of approaches -- no dice.  What is she trying to prove?
Listen to him.  Little Lord Fauntleroy!
I don't care if it is Marilyn Monroe -- I'm already in bed -- and I've taken a sleeping pill -- so I'm afraid the answer is no.
Well, after all, it's my apartment -- it's private property -- it's not a public playground.
Look, Mr. Vanderhof -- I've got you down here for tonight -- but I'm going to be using the place myself -- so I'll have to cancel.
Cancel? But it's her birthday -- I already ordered the cake --
I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
Thank you, Mr. Vanderhof. But I'm sick -- I have this terrible cold -- and a fever -- and I got to go to bed right after work.
Yeah.
Me?
So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.
Well -- we work in the same building -- and we try to keep it quiet --
These cases are harder on the doctor than on the patient. I ought to charge you by the mile.
But you're not out of the woods yet, Baxter -- because most of them try it again!  You know where I am if you need me.
Stuck on her! Obviously, you don't know me very well.
Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
Kubelik.
No kidding. Buddy-boy and Kubelik having themselves a little toot!
Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Will you excuse me?
You don't know what it's like -- standing next to you in that elevator, day after day -- Good morning, Miss Kubelik -- Good night, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm still crazy about you, Fran.
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
No. I have a date at eight-thirty.
Merry Christmas.
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
I'd spell it out for you -- only I can't spell.
What's the difference?  Some schnook that works in the office.
I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could never hold my liquor --
You bet it won't. I'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay --  That's right, Miss Olsen. I'm letting you go.
It's a thought.
What's it matter? Get to the point.
Yeah, I caught your show at Hau Fat.
I will -- I assure you that -- You got a fifty on that H-34 -- leave the ammo in boxes -- I'll get my men to bring the first drum with 'em --
Moonby. Got any Winstons?
Which part is that ?
No.
I was an FO for the 25th.
We do.
Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him, just like he said.
No -- most of 'em are still standing -- might've been disease.
Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise.
We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
Beats me -- the sun was too much for him, or the mud. Who knows ?
First Air Cavalry. They're the ones gonna get us into the River.
I'll go with him --
This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
Too far inland.
He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't give him no medals or nothing --
I wonder if that was the same copter.
Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. -- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. Then terminate his command.
This gentleman or myself ?
Entirely unnecessary, Captain.
A man of war is never bothered to aid an ally -- you will follow me, Captain.
Of course. I -- Once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here.
Sure -- fine --
Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke Six -- we'll need green smoke -- suggest you have the FAC mark it.
Just hold up a second, Captain -- I'll get to you soon enough -- We've got things to do here.
What'd you do for supplies?
No. They put out two or three for every one I needed. When you get to the one you'll use, you just stake it out. If something feels wrong, you just pass it up. On one mission, I had to pass up three and ended up living on rats and chocolate bars.
Yeah. Classical stuff -- scares the hell out of the slopes -- the boys love it.
No -- no, sir.
Yeah, I like it...
Still playing by the rules.  You're a damn good kiler.
Stinks. I could never figure --  I could never figure how they can teach boys how to bomb villages with napalm -- and not let them write the word 'fuck' on their airplanes.
Fuck no.
I had immense plans.
And you admired him?
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
Yeah... thanks.
The Yater -- the clear one with the thin stringer.
Yeah, Jesus Christ !
When?
I wasn't looking.. I was running.
Captain Willard -- we got these from Nha Thrang two days ago -- they expected you here then --
I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard --
Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
You're Australian?
Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'.
No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be crazy -- if you heard him talk, just last week, you'd never think he was crazy.
I know.
No sir, I think -- this'll be a little bit different --
Well , who's in command here?
I don't know -- don't have any idea -- I'm just the night man --
107  CONTINUED:
134  CONTINUED:  
150  CONTINUED:
I just want this over with.
Six months.
Oh.
I have not, but I very much want to.  What do you know about the trouble in Devil's Cauldron?
No way can he get away with this. I'll be back by tonight.
You were looking at it in the catalog.  Don't know where you can wear it...
It's exactly what you meant.
Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.
Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
Can't be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid.
We get wet, we freeze to death in a couple hours.
It could blow over tomorrow, too.
Yeah?
Yep.  Sometimes they do, but usually they end up crazy or dead.
You're not going to slow us down! Keep moving!
If that means freeze my balls off, no thanks.  I'll be okay.
I'm sure she's fine.  Seemed like a clever kid.
I'm living proof of that sad fact.
I'll get loose before that plane comes.
Not a damn thing.  What's going on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.
What are you talking about?
You're an outsider, Mr. Desmond. Step aside; stay out of it.
I should release Corbett because you want some votes?
Some day these people'll wake up, and you'll be the first one they'll run out of here.
This isn't your concern.  It's over, here and now.
Any idea who could've done it?
You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.
It's a long shot.
Cool out.  I ain't about to get blasted.
I'm right fuckin' here with you.
Musta never got a chance to -more-
On a good day I couldn't spare a crosswalk guard.  But now, no way.  Folks're batshit with the weather turning sour.  Bring him in yourself.
Next plane's not coming 'til next Monday.
... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
Leave me be! Why are you doing this? Why are you picking at my sores... What is it that you want?... You want what? What's with you? I hope getting me thinking of everything that's wrong when all I want is to not do this has some purpose.  What is it, Mom? No kidding.
Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
Emergency room only.
No. Actually, I think that's their technical name.
Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
Will you please take it?
I see the help -- judgement call.
No.
His name?
Okay.
Spence.
It's okay -- I'll sit here.
Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
Why did yo do this for me?
I can't. I work.
Takes months to know... They work little by little.  Talking like this is exhausting.
Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay.
Sex with Simon?
This one has a special meaning.
I'll take a bus.
I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.
What are you doing here?
I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts.
How to die, mostly.
I'll take care of myself --
Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like I have any choice in barging in.
Won't worry about it. You go ahead.
No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?
It looks like it really went over. You're sure making the rounds. Simon says you brought him soup last night. I hope he doesn't write you a note.
Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
Last word freak.
Sure thing.
Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
'Love was... '
That cleaning woman doesn't...
No need to stop being a lady... quit worrying -- you'll be back on your knees in no time.
Does it matter?
Did you like it that much?
I think of a man and take away reason and accountability.
I know just what you mean.  I'm pretty beat myself.
You're right.  Talking too much again.
How long have you been freelance?
It's just a shoot-out then.  Sixty- forty, at best.  Not my odds.
You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
You're too late.
No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the city.  Near the Plaza del Sol.
Tomorrow.  The buyer is Japanese. His retirement a condition of the bonus.
Paid in full.
Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts --
$1,000,000.
We have an M.O... Her system is protected by her 'pussy virus.'
What?  How did you know I had a cat?
The bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars.
Ten million --
No, stay in the car.  I want you to understand something.  If I intended to kill you, you would already be dead.
Yellow Pages.  V for veterinarian. There aren't that many.
An assassin?
Why?
Forget it!
This is something that is never going to end.  You can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. To survive, you have to go into deep hiding.  And that's going to take money, a lot of money.
Right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment.  He is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets.  He will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books.  If you keep a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled.  If you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them.
Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing.
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program.
They didn't give you a choice, did they?
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
Why not?
Why did you leave the Agency?
Tell me about the first time.
Because I want to know.
Thinking.
Why not?
Yes.
But you've never figured out a way to win.
What happens if you do?
Really?
Book.  Sunglasses.  Great.
Sorry.
How was the beach?
Not that I would know, but you look like you're really good at it.
Cheap as shit.
He will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd.  He'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank.
Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
He won't be able to.  He'll have to go inside.  He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there.  If the bank closes, he won't know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm sure.  And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.
I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
Except --
Yes.
You killed him here?  In this city, outside that bank?
What did he say?
He said I couldn't win.  That no one wins at this game.
No.
So?
When I first saw them I thought they were married.
So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
I'm sure you will.
Are you attracted to me?
Attraction is a complication?
It happened to you before?
What?
Electra --
I thought it was interesting --
Right.  In my hands I have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night.
I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
Do you believe that?
It's possible.
I hope not.
A dime.
I'm thinking about Moonpies.  Ain't that funny?  I haven't had a Moonpie since I was ten years old. Right now, I'm thinking how much I'd love one.
And an R.C.
That's correct.
What did the beer cost?
Squatted it.
You've got to stop using that word "we" it's getting kind of scary. Right Katka?
You got my word on it.
That makes you an expert I guess.
Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.
No.....But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later.
Thought of everything haven't you.
Well, don't get carried away.
I'll try not to, I'll leave that to you. Anyway, there's still plenty more of it.
Good, I love swinging a shovel.
Yeah, that was Honza's idea, I had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear.
Yeah, I'm beginning to see that.
Don't we have enough already?
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
I don't know Doug, we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it.
See if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere.
Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
Stealing's stealing, we might as well get what we need. This'll do for the floor and the walkway too.
Not yet, we need a few lengths of scaffold.
Am I late?
I fell in love.
Well, I take it you're going to drag her down to your minimal existence and adjust her mindset.
They ain't the only ones.
He got that one right.
Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.
It was all in Czech wasn't it.
Get me one of the disks. Ask a Czech girl to smuggle it in to me this evening. Put the others in a locker and write the details in a note to Reuters and be ready to send it, if this doesn't work. You'd better keep clear of your apartment too. Do you know someone with a phone?
Good, what's his number?
Doug, I can't just leave you!
Some deal you did there!
It was a condition of getting Doug out.
That's my mum's.
Have you met Holly? Josh's friend.
I think he's jealous of Havel.
What? You are crazy!
Look Kat it'll only take ten minutes. Without Jahn I might never find it... We'll just have a quick look and then you and I'll hit a tram.
I thought you loved me Doug but all you want from me is sex.
Right now, yeah - you're talking crap.
No, it's not true, you're lying.
It's not so much.
Donations only! And make the thing non-lingual, so everyone gets a handle on it.
Yep, it's all yours.
Don't worry. Thanks.
About forty minutes.
You mean it's started?
No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.
No, just a coffee.
Sometimes.
Alright!
Either you're a liar or you are a fool.
Really!
I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
You have the letter and my word, if you wish you may wait upstairs....Now, where are the disks?
And a fifty foot extension lead?
You don't have fifty foot of apartment!
Oh that's it? Everything I do is crap!
Well come on, sit down.
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
Josh, I need your help. Doug's been arrested, he's in big trouble. I thought maybe your father and the Embassy might be able to do something.
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
That was not my decision, I can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored. In the meantime no one else must know those files exist. Secure the building and I will arrange alternative safe storage immediately.
You don't need a car you can't drive for a month. Go see Marvin.
After he moved out, I invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had. He didn't show, not once.
I meant he's a doctor.
Whatever my life is, I'm going to be friggin' sure I'm never disappointed --
Me.
Were?
'Believe in yourself and they will. Let me ask you, Lizzie. Look in the mirror? Are you pretty --?'
You want to tell me...
Know so.
Could be...
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
Or building blocks for a world that never formed.
I'm really glad you think so.
No.  But are you -- impressed?
We're doing something -- ?
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
That. And less strange.
The truth. I just left you out of it.
Mars doesn't rise until 2:30
No.
That was read at my parents' wedding.
Jamie, he's careless. Reckless.  Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
Landon. We've lived with this for over a year now and --
I didn't say you did.
A similar triangle?
Scalene?
What do you want, Biff?
I don't know. National Cash Register?
I was practicing. I've got an audition next week -- I gotta practice. How am I gonna get famous if I don't practice?
Fine.
Learn anything?
Uh, thanks...
Yeah. Maybe so.
Uh, yeah, well, believe me, I sure feel like I know you!
Coming, Eileen...
George, if you don't want Chinese food, pick a place you want to go and make a reservation.
What drill?
Well... yeah...
Okay, then!
Huh?
I'm going to be at the dance.
George it's not your concern. Don't worry about it. Just remember that at 9:00, you'll be strolling through the parking lot and you'll see us -- struggling in the car, you'll run over, open the door and say....?
Unfortunately, the way things are going, you may get your wish. You may see the entire annhiliation of the world. If not, you'll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources. We can already see the air we breathe, not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes. We'll  see all of our oil reserves depleted, in fact, all of our energy sources. Yes, you people have a lot to look forward to -- a lot to see.
Hey, Mr. Arky, gimme a break!  I'm seventeen years old! I'm not responsible for all these problems!
What year?
Yeah,  Right.
Oh, right, right... 
Don't you understand? The mere act of sending matter back in time would change the course of events, and changing history is a responsibility that I do not wish to bear.
Just a guess. I figured kids would still be drinking Coke in 1982.
What if you lost your keys?
Well, it was there.
Look, Marty, she's not your mother yet. And if you don't go through with this, she may never be. I know it's hard, but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant. Some choices must be made that are difficult. Nonetheless, we must make them. Besides, this may be more than a simple question of your own existence, he added. The fate of the entire space-time continuum may rest on your shoulders . Marty tried to smile at him.
But I told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. So don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.
I run this place! 
What happened to Dick Wilson?
Me neither. I've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. You think yours did?
Hell no! The way my mom carries on about sex -- you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest. You shoulda seen her face when I told her we were gonna stay up all night Saturday, he added. Always afraid something is going to happen.
Gone?... Where?
Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you?
Well, I don't notice us hustling trash, either.
They come with the house.
She plays the clarinet, too.
Okay.
He never bit me.
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
You better not leave that Cadillac sitting out here.
Mmmmm.
Sure.
What'd you come out here for?
Well, it's not good enough.  Just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you, Kit? Guy like you.
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
It's okay.
Yeah.
Well, I mean there's nothing he wants to know about it... I've got to run.
Spanish.
I know.
Why not?
Is that all there is to it?
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
Well, that's the point, stupid.
You don't believe me, see for yourself.
Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while.
Well, I'm not going down there and look.
It was going too fast.
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
Yeah.
No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by.
Sure.
This your place?
Stay as long as you like.
Fine.
Okay, no monkey business then.
Well. I'm sorry, sir, but we've got to ask you for it.
You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
Nothing to apologize for, Casper.  You've gone beyond the call of duty tonight.  Mind if I get on the horn and radio the Cavaliers--?  They'll be worried.
It's your hand, Buckaroo.
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
Same one you had yesterday?
Have you warned Professor Hikita?
And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems?  You think they're mixed up in this?
Just 'grazed' you, huh?
I look great.  Let's rock 'n' roll.
Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...
Where's the professor?
Penny.  I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.
I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova!  I thought you liked me for myself.  But why should you, huh?  A jerk like me.
She was killed, Penny.
Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
How did she die?  I wanna know.
Damn John Whorfin--!
Should we be on Code Red?
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
I didn't drop 'em.
Pictures don't lie.
Barton. You see, Barton, I'm not just Bill's secretary – Bill and I are... I love. We-
...I know this must look... funny.
No, but the whole goddamn – Audrey? Have you ever had to read any of Bill's wrestling scenarios?
I want to know!
Well, m'olfactory's turnin' womanish on me – lyin' and deceitful...
Not anything, Bill. Don't test me.
What DID you mean?
Just Bill, please.
I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp, brick by brick. Raisin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river of manure from lappin' at m'door.
Are you all right?
Sure he did. And he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa.
Who?
Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him?
Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake.
Can be. Not easy, but –
Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York – hopefully our numbers are growing – who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths – not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...
I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.
Not at all. It's damned interesting.
Beery! You got no beef there! He's good.  Hell of an actor – though, for my money, you can't beat Jack Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, funny stuff. But don't get me wrong – Beery, a wrestling picture, that could be a pip. Wrestled some myself back in school. I guess you know the basic moves.
Ready... wrestle!
Know about it? I can practically see how they're doin' it. Brother, I wish I had a piece of that.
I've gotta call the police – or you could call for me –
Well, keep it for me. Maybe it'll bring you good luck. Yeah, it'll help you finish your script. You'll think about me...
I'm checking in. Barton Fink.
Well, I'm going to be working here, mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do you have room service?
What –
Also known as Madman Mundt.
I dunno, Duke. I kinda liked it.
Only fry you once.
No, not yet Jack. We just bought the story. Saturday Evening Post.
A couple days ago.
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose.  Sit down, Nick.
I know it is -- but sit down anyway so we can get it over with, okay?
No!  I'm working my tail off.  I'm off the sauce, I'm not even smoking anymore.
Yes.
What else is new?
Who?
Why didn't you tell me?
Who?
Sometimes I really hate you.
I thought you hardly know her.
She knew you'd find out who Lisa Henderson is.  You're a good cop -- what did she do?  Tell you casually and make it seem irrelevant?  Did she tell you in bed, Nick? That's how I'd do it.
About a year and a half.
I don't smoke.
No.  I said I liked Johnny to use his hands.  I don't give any rules, Nick.  I go with the flow.
I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
But you didn't hurt --
It's got to be tiring to beat that machine.
Why not?
My wife used to call me that.
No.  I wrote it years afterwards.
I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character.
Did you like her to watch?
Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?
I'll convince you.
No.
I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
Read me my rights and arrest me and I'll go downtown.
Routine.
Do you remember his name?
Nope. She did.  Like I say.  It never panned.
You did.
I never heard of him.
You sure got real conclusive ways of demonstrating that.
Everybody that she plays with dies.
Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.
She said she didn't know herself, just sort of did it on impulse.  The razor just happened to be there.
You forgot her degree in literature. She's a writer.  She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what it's about?
We bring her in for questioning.
No.
She killed him.
Don't fuck with me, Nick.  I don't need a reason to put your ass in a sling.
Yeah.  But you didn't tell me to stay away from her car.
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these.
Yeah – I'd do that... You could teach me.
Well, have you asked her to come back?
When I was poor, everybody doubted I could make it. When I got rich, everyone said, `yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' Now everyone says `he's killing himself.' So I clean up, and then they say `Look. His art's dead.' I don't take drugs, anyway. I'm healthy now.
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
I need a dealer.
I use a lot of colors – not only black.
What?
Not black.
Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
Still not here.
Why don't you try letting her in, Steve – I mean Shenge.
Your people.
Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich.
What's your fuckin' problem, anyway?
What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
I guess it was a long time ago.
I guess you did.
C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?
You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
Think so?
What's that?
They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
No, I'd like the scarf.
Haitian. I'm going to kill myself. I'm taking pills. Reds, blues, greens.
My point exactly.
What time is it?
5:11.
That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em!
Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
I think I'll take the stairs.
I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
No darker than yours, Bruce.
... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
Yes and no...
Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
Ah ... then you've come to the right lonely mansion.
Y'mean take off our costumes?
You first.
Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City.
I am the light of this city.  <u>And</u> I am its mean, twisted soul.  Does it really matter who's the "mayor"?
Women... nothing surprises me, Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage?  Bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window.  Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry.  Yeah -- Oswald, please.
... eight, seven...
Fred.  Fred?  He's ... actually he's been on an extended vacation, and --
Max, elections happen in November. Is this not late December, or have I inhaled too much swamp gas in my time?
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
I don't.  So, no.
I have been part of the greatest adventure ever know.  I have found purpose here, and the family I could never have.
I've seen the best doctors--! A gentleman does not discuss his health.  It's not civilized.  I hope I've taught you at least that much, young man.
Attending to heroes?  No sir.  My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
You are going back to school.
Whatever you say, lady.  It's all in a day's work for me.
What are you talking about?
Divide and conquer.
Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
I'm totally over her.  Positively.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
Dr. Pamela Isley.
We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat.  No coolants to preserve food.  Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
Although the Wayne Foundation is hosting the event, sadly I will be unable to attend.  Thank you all.  Good day, Doctor.
Well...um...her.
I'm fine.  See.  Me.  here.  Alive. How are we gonna work together if you're never going to trust me?
I'm scared, Dick.  Maybe for the first time in my life.  I'm really scared.
Her name is Pamela Isley.  I saw her talking to Gordon.  She must have stolen his keys, altered the signal-
Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
OK, OK.  Ms. Ivy to the rescue.  Now where do I find your brittle bride?
Where is my wife?
You lie!
You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  These lips can be murder.
It'll never work.
He ran away?
Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...
...Afraid.
What?
No demons, son.  Your monsters are here. Until you fact that, I fear you will spend your life fleeing them.
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
You are direct, aren't you?
Did Two-Face call him Bruce?
Exactly!
Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me. Personally. Just like I tell everyone.  Well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.
Gracious even in defeat. How vaguely disappointing. When all this could have been ours together.
Would you? I'm not so sure.
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
Don't believe it. I'm just skin deep.
He sure did.
And now....
What are you talking about?
Look, spare me the sermons, okay. You're just some rich guy who is trying to do a good deed. You don't even know me.
Save the sermons about how great you want my life to be, okay, Bruce? If it weren't for Batman my parents wouldn't be dead. You don't get it, do you? This is all your fault.
We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school.
Bruce, you can't.
Chase is coming for dinner. Why don't you join us.
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
What the hell is going on here?
The coin _wants_ to decide.
Just call us Harvey. Can we get you a sandwich? A soft drink? Given all the trouble we caused you, how about we cut you in for a share of tonight's haul?
Here. Get a good seat.
Miss.
Actually, I wanted to talk to Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne, would you?
If not for you I never would've made it. You know that. My own parents couldn't have...  ... The boy, Alfred. You'll both be provided for. Don't let all this got to waste.
Well -- I think you might consider
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
I loathe bats.
I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.
... Terror.
Well, Bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others.
I'll take you home if you'd like.
God.  You would.  Come on, Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.
... We could try that.
I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
I don't understand it. You can do so much good for people. As Bruce Wayne.
I'm frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you.
I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to...
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --
Honey - - I would know any randomly selected square inch of Vicki Vale.  If I had a good enough hint.
Well, I'm starving.  Will you at least buy me a hamburger?
Not what?
Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
Yeeees?
What's wrong with you, David?  All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.
One.
Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch.
Excuse me.
What?  What?
Howls he getting on with the family?
I beg your pardon?
You're not going to ....
Er ... pray tell me why?
No it wasn't!
Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your wife.
Uh... maybe he's blind... Huh huh, check this out.
And Boot-Head.
Yeah or like a Seven-Eleven or something... Are we almost there?
Uh...
Uh... I think I'm seeing something too. It's like a really long time ago...
Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
Shut up, dill-hole.
Uh... dill, um, face...
That's alright. I'd rather not know your real names anyways. I'm Muddy. Look, I'm gonna get right to the point. I'll pay you ten grand plus expenses, all payable after you do her...
Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
Bork! You are a federal agent. You represent the United States Government... Never end a sentence with a preposition. Try again.
That's better. Yes?
Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh.
Cool, huh huh.  Hey Beavis that's that dude that's paying us to do his wife.
Yup. Huh huh.
Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
What?
Maybe this is heaven.
Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
I don't know.  <u>Jane, Jane, up here</u>!
She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
I don't know... what are you looking up?
Look, she's right.  We'll just start simple, honey, be tougher. I feel... confident.  C'mon.
Where are your skulls and bones?
Of course I did.
<u>Betelgeuse</u>!
I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
But <u>we</u> let him out.
The sushi?  I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?
Who did the sushi?
What makes you think she likes me?
Just a hunch.
3:30 I guess.
I'm wearing contacts... Also I read through <u>Handbook for the</u> <u>Recently Deceased</u>.  It says that live people ignore the strange and unusual... not me... <u>I am</u> strange and unusual.
Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a businessman.  I'm the man what <u>am</u>. <u>Beee</u>tel <u>Jooose</u>!  <u>Who</u> do I gotta kill?
We tried.
The Intermediate Interface chapter on Haunting says it all.  Get 'em out yourself.  It's your house. Haunted houses don't come easy.
Start simply.  Do what you know. Use your talents.  Practice.  We only help those who help themselves. Just do a little at a time.  And of course, practice, practice, practice.  It's tricky but -- you weren't murderers by any chance, were you?
<u>Never trust the living</u>!  We <u>cannot</u> have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death.
Pity.  Murderers seem to have an easy time of it.  Just look at Amityville.  He was one of my boys.  Didn't have to give that one any lessons. From day one... But I must be off ... I've got a planeload of football players crashed in the midwest... they need a lot of help, just with the basics.
Jane, don't send photographs of our house around the country! We're not interested in selling.
You could double the size of your hardware store!  You'll be rich.
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
I want to get in.
That's right.  They treat you like scum I bet?
I... I don't know what your name is.
Your qu...?  But you're...
There's only one Chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook Cantonese.  They don't know better.
At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
Otho'll know what to do.
Lydia, we're the first trickle! In a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.
... sheets.
<u>This is not a joke</u>!  That sheet was full of ghosts.
Otho, can you do it?
Joke!  Joke!  Aspirin!  It doesn't matter what brand.
Don't you <u>dare</u> talk to others about me.  I'm an <u>artist</u>!  The only thing that scares me is being embarrassed in front of my friends.  Do you know how hard it is to get civilized people to set foot in this part of Connecticut? Not a solitary word of this pubescent tripe to anyone.
You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn here, a very sophisticated pair.  We must protect them, treat them with respect, <u>nur</u>ture them.
That's a skeleton key.  It'll open any door in that house.  Will you give it to your father?  And you might mention that I single-handedly decorated the house.  In case he needs advice in that area.  Come see me.
Remind me to talk to your mother about the dress code.  I'm sure you're going to be very happy there.
Their wedding clothes.
Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?
Thank you, Robert.
... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.
I don't think so, he should be along soon...
My name is Chance.
Oh. Well, they're just a wonderful couple, we've been friends for years. We visit their island quite often.
I admire that in a person. As for myself, I find there is so much to assimilate that it can become quite muddling at times...
Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.
... And Ben is just mad about you - you've lifted his spirits so - it's just... Well, it's just a real pleasure having you with us.
He does...?
Yes, so do we.
I know you do - you and your television...  ... Good luck, Chauncey.
I see.
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.
Yes, I do, it's very good.
Yes, Eve. I shall yield too.
To exchange our thoughts - what does a Russian know about business? On the other hand, what does an American know about diplomacy?
Yes, it is.  Would you tell me your name again, please?
And yours, sir - Chauncey Gardiner!  How poetic! Chauncey, a name of uncertain meaning! And Gardiner, a bit of the French, a suggestion of a stroll through the flowers! A beautiful name, my friend!
Yes. Chauncey is fine.
No, Ben.
Yes, Ben - are you going to die now?
... I've worked very hard and enjoyed my life... I've known success... and I've felt love... My associates, Chauncey - I've talked with them about you... They're eager to meet you... very eager to meet you... I'm very fond of you, Chauncey... And I understand Eve... Tell her that... tell her I'm madly in love with her...
Oh, Mr. Rand, of course. Right this way, sir.
Yes.
Yes. I have seen styles on television.
Yes. It seems to be.
I'm afraid he's slippin' a bit with every hour that goes by...
Is his back feeling better?
I was given meals, and a home...
Yes, I will.
That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
Hah!... Tell me the truth, Eve - if I wait until I feel better, will I ever meet the man?
... Thank you, Chauncey... Thank you very much.  ... All right, Robert, I'm all yours.
Good evening, Wilson.
Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
Of course... I'm so sorry for you, Eve...
I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.
Hmmm... Take this down.  I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."'
Yes, sir.
A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself!
It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific!
I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...
Mr. Gardiner...
I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
... and I want to show off his skills by performing a one-puppet extravaganza in Reno.
The one where you're that jewel thief.
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
I'm a puppeteer.
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
I'm scared.
I have to go back now.
You weren't you. You were John Malkovich.
Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.
I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
Us, of course.
And he was with her.
I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated.  No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.
That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
I love you so much.
It's Elijah.
Sure. We could really use a farmer. We'd be grateful for the help.  Also, I think, you know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly, a little puppet show every once in a while, would do a lot to lift our spirits. You know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly.
Simulates?
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
You suggest what? I have no time for piddling suggestions from mumbling job applicants, my good man. Besides, Dr. Lester will see you now. I think that's what he said.
Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.
No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.
Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
Yessir.
That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run.
Thank you, sir.
There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly.
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
Buy you a drink, Maxine?
Well, I'm a puppeteer...
Please, let me explain.
Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
What's he been in?
Tickets to Malkovich?
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...
Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings and a halo.
Can I be anyone I want?
You can be John Malkovich.
Two hundred dollars, please.
Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I don't know. That's the best I can think of right now.
No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.
Forget it.
Fine woman, Floris. I don't know how she puts up with this damn speech impediment of mine.
Think, Jew florist?
Do you?
Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.
Do we get to wear a crown?
Count me in.
Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
With immense pleasure, my dear. Down that hall, ninth door on the left. Watch the step down. It's sunken, you know.
But now we've lost access to Craig.
My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.
Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
No.
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
Never heard of it.
Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
Who's calling?
Do you mind?
You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
You're right, my darling, it's so much more. It's playing with people!
There was a boy there...said mama was a jailbird...said he could prove it..
Here, let me carry that.
Well what?
Can't say. It's something can't be planned.
No, Stamp. I ain't.
You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood?
NO. THEY TRIED ONCE BUT I STOPPED THEM. THEY WON'T EVER COME BACK...YOU MY BEST THING.
No. Since mama lost her job, we don't have no more pies..
They treating you right over at the Bodwins?
She gone like they say?
I don't. I have my own.
Thank you.
Oh yeah. They good. Can't say they ain't good. I wouldn't trade them for another pair, tell you that. But you come back in a few days - give me a chance to lead'em to it. All right?
Well, what can you do?
No..No that won't do...
That was fun.
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
DO YOU FORGIVE ME?
NO!...She wanted me to do it.
Was over to Baby Suggs.
NO! Shouldn't be no days! You know all about it and don't give him a hand? That don't sound like you, Ella. Me and you been pulling colored folk out the water more'n twenty years! Now you tell me you can't offer a man a bed?! A working man who can pay his own way?
What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?
What run him off? Tell me that!
And he left when he found out what Sethe did?  What you say casts a different light on it, I guess...I thought-
You pick any house, any house where colored live. Pick any one and you welcome to stay there. I'm apologizing 'cause they didn't offer to tell you. But you welcome anywhere you want to be. My house. John and Ella. Miss Lady Jones..anybody. You choose. You ain't got to sleep in no cellar and I apologize for each and every night.
Just me.
Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
There was a rooster named Mister down at Sweet Home. Last time I saw Halle, with that butter all over his face and me with an iron bit in my mouth, I saw Mister - sitting on a tub. He loved that tub. Like king on a throne. He was a hateful thing. Bloody and evil..But he was better than me.  Mister was allowed to be and stay what he was. Even if you cooked him you'd be cooking a rooster named Mister. But wasn't no way I'd ever be Paul D. again..Schoolteacher changed me. Was never no beating under Mr. Garner. Schoolteacher changed that. Why wouldn't a man run from that? Why wouldn't a man not work, kill, starve, pull out his own heart to stop feeling 'stead of feeling that? And it strikes me, it's got to be cause we were something else. And that something was less than a chicken sitting in the sun on a tub.
What yard? When who-
She ain't crazy. She love those children. She was trying to outhurt the hurter's all.
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
She what run you off? Not what I told you 'bout Sethe?
Look - Denver be here in the day. I be here in the night. I'm a take care of you, you hear? Starting now.
Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
Dude, I finally got the venue I wanted.  I'm Performing my dance quintet--you know, my cycle--at Crane Jackson's Fountain Street Theatre on Tuesday night, and I'd love it if you came and gave me notes.
What do you think?
Visiting friends of hers in Palm Springs.  Just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us.
The?  Who the fff--
Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.
Fuck you.
I'm going home, Donny.
What--
So you have no frame of reference, Donny.  You're like a child who wanders in in the middle of a movie and wants to know--
I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.
WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT!
Are you gonna split hairs?
Well--
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin' to find reverse on a Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
Lebowski on the right?
They're not his, heh-heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner-city children of promise but without the--
One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went to college?
Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust, coloration.
And was there anything of value in the car?
Separate incidents?
Regrettably, it's true, standards have fallen in adult entertainment. It's video, Dude.  Now that we're competing with the amateurs, we can't afford to invest that little extra in story, production value, feeling.
Of course you do.  I can see you're anxious for me to get to the point. Well Dude, here it is.  Where's Bunny?
In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal.  Which bothers some men.  The word itself makes some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.
Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.  Little matter to me that this woman chose to pursue a career
She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim.
Dieter has been on the fringes of-- well, of everything in L.A., for about twenty years.  Look at my LP's. Under 'Autobahn.'
Larry Sellers, a high-school kid. Real fucking brat.
It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just--
Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--
What the fuck are you--
Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?
Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy--
You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.
This is a league game.  This determines who enters the next round- robin, am I wrong?
Hey Walter--
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!
Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
Just for making the hand-off?
Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't told me how we get her back.  Where is she?
There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car!
We throw the money out of the moving car!
The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!
Walter, please--
The nail polish, Walter.
You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, Dude.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me a very secure feeling.
Dude--
All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek?
Uh.
Look, man, did you--
You're going to enter a world of pain, son.  We know that this is your homework.  We know you stole a car--
Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh.
Yeah?
Huh?
This driveway.
Yeah, I can see that, Dude.
A hundred and eighty dollars?!
Walter--
Yeah?
Hey, just tell me where the fuck you want us to go.
Did I urinate on your rug?
Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life.  Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
Well we--I don't--
Wanna hear something more impressive? My first twenty fights were stumblebums handpicked by my manager. My girlfriend saw you fight a couple times over at the Olympic. Says maybe you <i>could</i> take me.
He's half yours, partner.
Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
What about Nomak?
I didn't know.
If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
Nomak's different.  He's the carrier.  There's something driving him beyond the Thirst.  Something we're missing.
Why?
Took you long enough.
I'll show you.
It means I'm starting to wonder if the vampires still have their hooks in you. You've been acting strange ever since I gave you the cure.  Reckless, quick to anger --  You said it yourself, Whistler.  Those vampires knew our defense system backwards and forwards.  Where'd they get their intel?
Just out connecting a few dots.
Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
Seems like there's a lot of that going around these days.
I don't know about this, man --
You're wasting your time, Blade.  The flechette's a dud.
Thiavolos, as we used to say in Greece. The Devil.  Pure Thirst.  Nothing more. He was born a vampire, but he is an anomaly.  Like you.  Unlike the rest of us, however, he feeds on not just humans, but vampires as well.
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
Look, what's your problem?
Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a UV laser going.
Blade doesn't talk about anything much.  What about you, though?
Wait.
You're wrong.
You don't have a few minutes, Frost.
You're blind --
Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that.
Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story.
Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card.
How long have we been driving?
I don't know. I woke up just before you did --
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
You don't have to be.
He looks different now, burns are less extreme, some of these wounds have closed up --
Someone who's sick of living off scraps. The coming age belongs to us, not the humans!  When the final war between our races comes, who do you want leading the charge?
A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight.
That's right. The answers were there all along, of course, scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind. Waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them. My elders were foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales. But I knew better.  Imagine my surprise when Blade turned out to be the key which would set that force free.
You.
What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
Get away from him!
Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.
Then vampirism is a genetic defect, just like Hemolytic anemia?
How?
--which she may have--
Try, please, Anna--
What do you mean?
Trying to find the energy.
Inside the grave?
I haven't killed any--
It's like traveling back in time.
Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.
No--<u>this</u> is weird.
You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
You feel no need to get married or anything.
Anna--
You want me to scooch over next to you?
And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
We're leaving--case dismissed for lack of evidence. Maybe on the ride home we can figure how the fuck we're going to graduate with no thesis.
I guess, yeah.
Just...try and go back to sleep.
--no, you're not. You love me too much. You don't want to see them kill me.
Whatever you want.
I see for proof positive you're the goddamn witch--
No.
Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
Fine.
Like hell. Play the goddamn tape.
--go!
--which'd be about ten bucks--
Don't have one.
Next time try putting on shoes--
--turn the camera off--
--Graduate Thesis--
<u>What</u>?
First enormous brick warehouse on your right.
Guy who killed all the kids in the '40s.
Ah, Domini?
There is something <u>there</u>--don't ask, just trust me.
Elly Kedward?
Get some more beer.
Whatever.
Nick, what you should do is get her back up and get her to a goddamn <u>doctor</u>.
Shoot.
Domini.
--why in the world would she just fly the coop in the first place?
We're not dealing with fucking logic here!
Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had?
--yes--
--his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
Who <u>is</u> this??
There was an accident early this morning. Another car. Your father's injuries were fatal.
No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--
You can stay at my place, I'll drop you there.
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.
What?
Uh-huh. So how do you know it was a he?
...Huh?
When you don't they're usually nice.
With your gun?...
You've got a very sophisticated palate.
Christ, I'm getting bored.
Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from?
Listen, I ain't a marriage counselor. I don't know what goes on, I don't wanna know... But I like you. I always liked you...
What's the matter?
I don't know. Motel... Abby--
Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?
I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor--
You owe me for two weeks.
I didn't say that. All I said was you're an idiot. Hell, you been thinking about it so much it's driving you simple.
Ya catch any fish?
Yeah...
Jesus, I don't believe it...
You said the usual--
What's the point?
The point is we don't serve niggers here.
Meurice...
We get a lot of assholes in here, Marty.
Not here tonight. Wasn't here last night. He's especially not back in his office.
No, you do, cowboy. You been to the bar?
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
Yeah. I get it.
Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered some things. .Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
Yes sir.
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Then, shut up!
Shit. You better tell me something.
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
. I saw you come in, talk on the phone. get undressed.
What do you want?
No.
It's okay. It's okay.
Don't say that.
Do you love me?
And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then!
No.  Hi baby.
My secret lover.
What?
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.
Terrible. boring.
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything?
Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
I guess you have to get back home soon?
Still, it must be kinda rough.
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Now, how are you going to do that?
Okay. yeah, call.
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.?
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
Jeffrey. are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey. I mean it.
What is it?
Let's wait for some slow one.
Okay.
Sandy. this guy is a killer!! I promise you.
uh uh.
Alright.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Yeah.
Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.
You can change it if you want to.
Okay.
Oh, I see.  George.  Well, that explains everything.  Open your mouth, George.
On the plane.
You'll see for yourself.
Baby, you didn't have to come.
Which brings me to rule number three: which says, fuck rules one and two, skip bail and take off.
So you do have an agreement with the United States Government, Mr. Jung, correct?
What are we doing here, Diego?  This guy's a clown.  He's talking about clothes.
Excuse me?
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
Yeah, I know, it's a lot of weight.
You guys are such babies.  You want to go home, go.  Me, I'm not going to stop until I find the fucking motherlode.
I heard.
No fucking way.
Fuck you, then.  I sign nothing.
What?
You like to make the boundaries disappear.  It's not only the money, is it, George?  The adventure is part of the victory.  It's the thrill, ah?
Great.  I love the Bahamas.
Congratulations, brother.  I've been waiting for you.
Perfect, George.  Perfect.  Everything is fine down here.  Everything is all set up.
I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
I don't give a shit.  Close enough.
Derek Foreal.  Derek Foreal.  Derek fucking Foreal.  Alright?  The answer to all your dreams.  Are you happy now?
You fucked me, Diego.
Look at this credenza.  If you don't mind me asking, how much is something like that?  It's got to cost a fortune.
Actually, it was three.
With all respect, Padrino.  Diego is my partner.  I do not do business without him.
Yes, sir.  As much as you can give me.
Sure.
And Diego?
Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some scotch.
I know.
I'm going to California.
I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.
No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?
Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.
We sell it.  I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a lot of weed for our head.  What do you think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies and everything.
Tuna.
You know how we were wondering what we were going to do for money?  Being how we don't want to get jobs and whatnot? Well, check this out.
I don't think so.
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?
She did that before.
Where are you going?
Don't give me that shit.  You just better do something.
Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know?
Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going.
Yeah.
I swear on your life.
After everything.  After everything, the only thing left out of my whole life is you.
Because she's visiting me.
Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?
Amigo, you bring me fifty-thousand dollars, and I have no more concerns.
Relax.  I've flown with my old man a million times.  And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about.
Fuck yeah.  I never seen nothing like it.  I'm fucking wasted.
You know, he's got a point.  We're fucking Americans.  We stick out like sore thumbs.
Exactly.
Second district ...
The NLF has condemned you to death.
You've got to change occupations, Hacene. Right away!
I'll explain.
Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist.
Go away.
Yes, I think so too ... It's been organized well ... But what will the French do?
Rue de Thèbes? In the Upper Casbah, I think ...
Of course I am.
Fine, Charlie.  You familiar with the Marsh case?
I want you to hit all the dealers in town.  Give them a list of people close to Marsh and see if any of them use.  Then I want you to check out a Doctor Alan Paley.  He lives up in Roseburg.
An inquiry into what?
He can remember at least one occasion -- and the receptionist can recall two times when she accompanied Marsh to the office.
Increase his heart rate.
What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
Thank you, Doctor McCurdy.  Your witness.
What was the nature of the argument?
He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.
Alright -- I'm going to allow his testimony.
Because she's clever.  Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.
Aren't they all?
Your Honor -- please!
Back off, John.
Really?  What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning?
Objection!  Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.
You get his statement?
Why did you come by?
Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
What about Miss Lawson?
Yes.
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
What happened after that?
You didn't grab her and try to kiss her?
No -- she asked me about cocaine.
High school?
What else did the District Attorney's Office tell you to say?
Where did you meet him?
We dated for about a month last year.
I realized he wasn't serious.  He was seeing other women -- asking other nurses at the hospital out, so I ended it.
Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?
Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death?
Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?
No.
Then you would have gotten your money?
Yes.
Frank -- what are you doing here?
I'll have you out in a few hours.
I know.
Oh -- Well, they're different.
Great.  I'll see you at the office at nine.
What?
She's mistaken.
It isn't true.  You have to believe me.
I don't know, Frank -- but don't you think that's something we should find out?
Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.
You don't need anybody.
Hey, you know better than that.  What did I teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something?
"Discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities."  Who told you to say that?
Really?
Some example you set.
Why don't you talk to him now?
It's bad enough that you are.  It's even worse that you can stand here and lie to me.
Talk to me.
Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
We have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty.
Doesn't matter. Move on.
Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?
Come here a minute.
Goddamn sonofabitch! I don't want to hear anymore! Sonofabitch! Burn the damn thing! I don't want to hear it! Throw it away!
Well, I'd like to read them.
Yeah. But I thought she died.
He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.
Not yet. You want to go?
I never knew that.
Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
No. I was just going to have some iced tea then split the atom, but that can wait.  I just have to get my shoes.
No.
Maybe it's because I live here.
After the divorce.
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
No, really?
Oh, yeah. Actually, I had an assignment in Greece and I had to go through Bari to get the boat at Brindisi. But it looked so pretty I got off and stayed for a few days. Breathtaking country.
No, not at all --  except those are poisonous.
WHAT!
Francesca.
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
Why?
Clean?
That's very nice of you. I don't get many dinner invitations on the job. It would be a welcome change. Thanks.
Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
We got engaged.
Well, let's just call it a compliment and move on.  Did you love teaching?
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
Yes.
What?
No.
I told you, I love other people.
But it's not the same.
No, I'm just saying --
Yes! Hi.
I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot.
I'll pick you up.
Have you ever been to that station?
It's okay. It's not that hot anymore. Thanks God.
Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
How do you know what I experience?
You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in Romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.
WHY?
Robert, if that happens, you'll have to decide. I won't be able to.
Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
Well you should all go to bed early. I'll do the cleaning up.
Frannie.
Well, she's... she's real pretty and ... and she's got a cute shape... she's a good sport, ya know, for laughs and  ... she loves fried chicken wings and beer.
Yes, they are.
Cremated?!
Well, that's crazy. I don't know anybody who gets cremated.
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
Well, close the fucking door by all means.  But don't expect me to go down there and do it.
Some flies?  I think this qualifies as way more than "some."
Maurice, man, shut the fuck up.
Spooked?
Maurice left.  Tia's taking a bath.
Well, go find his lazy ass.  I scratch any more tonight I'm gonna have carpal tunnel syndrome.
Anywhere but here.
But that's your old hood, Pops.
Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high.
Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street.  Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block.
Let me see your hand.
But.
Hush, baby.
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
I didn't want a piece of yours, I wanted my own.
No brother.  I wouldn'ta.  I never done a man - any man.  Let alone a brother like that.  Course, as you can see, no good deed goes unfucked.  Now the question is, if the good get fucked, what we got saved up for the bad?  You about to find out.
I lied.
I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
Fine.  Maybe I got nothing to lose. 'Cept you.
Mother!  No.
My God.  My dress.  We have to find it. And burn it.  And shut the door.
Why?
Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us?  Fingers rotting off?
Lucky thing.
Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
And you believe her?
Patrick, he's...
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
And you?  Still a pig.  Just a much fatter one.
No reason to get nasty.  Yeah, I've stayed in the organization.  But then again I never got the percentage you did.
What building?
That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
You was just doing your job.
Potential toxic dump site.
The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.
No thanks.
No, no, Caesar.  Not now.
Admit what?
You aim a gun at me?!  Do you know who I am?!  I am Gino Marzzone.  You understand?
What the fuck is going on?
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
You're right.  You don't have to tell me, if you don't want to.  I just hope you understand you're among good people here.
What?  Oh, come on, I didn't use one of the good towels.
What are you talking about?
I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.
Violet, please!
Caesar ...
Not until he has the money!
Good idea.
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks, though.
Another time.
Lick me.
Either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face.
Are you okay, Violet?
Yeah, it was Violet's idea.  I was so wound up about Gino, she was trying to help me relax.
All right.
Good guess.
Caesar is your husband?
You have to ask?
No.
How did you meet him?
He's a launderer?
You didn't want to see me, did you?
If there is one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading.
If those quarters fell to the floor, would you still reach up to that cash register?
That's why I need your help.  You said you were good.
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
If he does ...
You'll be clean and we'll be rich.
okay, all right.
I was so afraid you ...
Jesus Christ, Pop.  You got two hours until your plane leaves.
Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far.  Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, does it?  We'll clean up the field.  You clean up your budgets.
<u>No you're not</u>.  You're not going anywhere.  I'm shutting this down.
Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
...they won't let you go...
Am I Treadstone?  Me?  What the hell're you talking about?
They're right about you, aren't they?  You're fried.  You really don't know what's going on, do you?
I know you've been trying to kill me.
Keep it. 

Paris?
-- sir? --
Yes.  Is he there?
I have some very bad news for you, sir.  I'm terrible sorry to have to tell you this, but Monsieur Kane has passed away almost two weeks ago...
Really.
We thought you were gone for good.
Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.
Get me out of here.  <u>Please</u>.
I want to go home.
-- get the fuck out of here -- all this money, this crazy offer, I mean give me a fucking break with this, this is -- 
I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?
Listen to what you want.
When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
-- you could put it together --
What are you talking about?
Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
You're paranoid.  You were shot. It's natural.
How could I forget about you?  You're the only person I know.
All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
-- just --
Who paid the bill?
I won't let that happen.
xxxxxx

I said, someone came last night --  Look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --
I'm sorry.
It doesn't matter now.  We've just got to be the first ones there.  Get everybody up.  I want them all activated.
Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
That'll solve all our problems.
-- he's running from the cops, he's got a bag filled with God knows what, he's in the building and I don't know where! --
I don't know.
What have you done to my flat?
... fix themselves.
Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!
...sabotage!
What do I have to do.
Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late?
Gillian Layton?
I assure you, Sam, I'm doing everything within my power. But the rules of the game are laid down, and we all have to play by them - even me.
Yes, well, from the Department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...
Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded -
Sorry. Nothing.  See you - I'm going to be late.
Sam, your life is going wrong - let your friends tell you - Records is a dead end department, no Security Level worth a damn, it's impossible to get noticed -
Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
For my sins. Are you settling in alright?
Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped by. Unfortunately, I don't have any time right now I've got a queue of customers to deal with - er, why don't we have a drink tonight?
Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake.
You got the wrong man.
We suspect him of freelance subversion.
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
They weren't at school with us.
There are no coincidences, Sam. Everything's connected, all along the line. Cause and effect. That's the beauty of it. Our job is to trace the connections and reveal them.  This whole Buttle/Tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside. Bye bye.
Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?
Well, could you stay away from me until this thing blows over.
Where do I get it stamped?
Don't look back! Act naturally!
Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
Why not?
Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties.
Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does?
Well, all wars do -
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
Who will?
Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop! 
Will you please turn back.
Shit! The house is on fire!
........... It's a bomb isn't it?
C'mon. We've got to get out of here.
It's not our mistake!
Isn't it? Whose is it?
Expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of Buttle, Archibald, shoe repair operative, but Security has invoiced Admin for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer
What a BITCH!
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
I delivered it.
Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.
What? Now? It's my lunch hour.
Er, yes ...
It's too exciting. I've left Dr Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.
I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
Not ... as such ...
Ha!!
What?
Couldn't stand the pa - ah - we're getting warm -
I feel for you, but we got an emergency here. It's a weekend of full moons.  Everyone's called in sick. Larry, Veeber, Stanley too. We need bodies out there. I had to put Marcus on Twelve Young. You know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row.
She's having a baby. Twins.
He looks like a cop.
Stressed? He's psycho.
Mary said you might be coming.
I better just go in and see her.
That's too bad. Get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. Some kid I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. Damn, I thought I could make it onto the balcony like Tiger. He's fat, that's why, falls faster. I'm trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. Am I shot, Frank?
Boy can't shoot for shit, either. Goddamn that's hot.
I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
You're going to three-four Avenue C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.
IB Bangin.
No, no medicine!
Yeah?
Oh man, Bucky.
John, play the Sinatra.
Yes.
Yes.
Thing is, I'm supposed to be the fuckup. The one on the stretcher in there--that's supposed to be me. With my parents crying out here. I got a lot of guilt, you know what I mean?
Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
Sleeping.
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
I wish these people would leave already. I can't listen to another story. Did you see him?  That doctor says the brain is coming around. They're waiting for the heart to stabilize. I don't know who to believe. He says they still have to keep him tied up.
She loves me the way no woman ever has.
She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving.
What's wrong.
We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.
I don't want to hear about it, okay? That's three jobs for the night. It's over. Three jobs and time for a drink. Six am, the cocktail hour. Pass the bottle; I know you're holding.
I'll drink to that.
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
Look out!
The brakes are shot.
I don't know--let's break some windows.
He's crazy. He can't help it.
Well, why don't they put him away? Prisons don't want him. I took him to the hospital yesterday and here he is again.
Frank!
You're crazy.
You know what. The radio.
It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
Never to pretend to know more than I did.
We're conversing...Oh my, the names of the entire Cabinet has slipped my mind.  What are they?
What's wrong with it?
Your coat jacket is rising up in back.
Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that.  You don't want to look shifty, do you?
Why?
You want to start going over who they could have gotten?  They can't take on people like this for network news.  For God's sake.  What's going on?
Thanks.  The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.  Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.
You're welcome.  Sow how does it feel to...I know you gotta go -- Me too.  We're very busy here.
As good as humanly possible.
You too.
No.
Then it went well.
Yes, I guess.  Yes.
You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.
Because we have the kind of relationship where if I were the Devil, you'd be the only one I told.
I just found out.  You didn't say anything to me?  You just resign? Will you meet me now? -- No, now! I'm going away tomorrow.  Please.
I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
Yes.
I'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we'll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and I'll tell him...  ...it's not nice to make fun of single, fat ladies.
I hope so...  No.  I'm not really mad.  I'll miss you, we'll talk, we'll always be friends...we'll get hot for each other every few years at dinner and never act on it, okay?
Well, we met about three months ago. He works at the surgeon general office. He loves boating.  So, he's been getting me into water skiing.
Outside?
Thanks.
The cost-efficient reporter.
No, I don't.  He happens to deserve the credit.  He's right here.
Yes, there is.
Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?  Take a breath.
Please, Bobbie, we're pushing.
What?
Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work.
Well, who knows.  Just let m tell you what my favorite teacher ever, told me -- 'Don't be afraid to be wonderful.'
I don't know.
Okay, that's your opinion.  I don't agree.
Thank you.  They hated me.  I don't hate them.
I like "godsend."
That actually goes on...
Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track.  Did you go to college?
Hey?
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
Okay.
Ah, I don't want any credit.  Bobbie and I serve anonymously.
Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.
I'll wait for you till seven.
Jennifer, you want to have another drink?
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
Nooo.  Is it your story?
No.  Were you going to you?
Me!
Good...Another is you're trying to make it all about sex and heat and nothing else.
Don't run off --  like everything's settled the minute you make up your mind.
Okay.  Good night.
It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
You want to come?
Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.
Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you?
Through the closet.
I'm not knocking it.  It's a great solution.  Not only the storage but you can see everything you have.
Are you okay?
Don't be silly.  What are you sorry about?
The way you were looking at me, I just went.
I just might.
Oh yeah?
I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it.
Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
Yeah.
What, right now?
I already told you I'm not.
Um...
Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
What's it called?
Uh, well, I'm a little nervous, I never did a person before.
Oh...
Walter!  Jeez!
Ready?  We've got plenty of time.
Oh, I don't know.  Smart people. Creative people I guess.
Of course I do!
Why not?!
Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
Ok...tonight.  I'll make a statue of you tonight, OK?
Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.
I wouldn't give up your day job.
Why not?
That's the idea, Walter.  It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
I don't know it was made out of driftwood and dipped in sulfuric acid.  It was out there...
Let's check out the scene.
Well do some looking around the room. I see cups, ashtrays - let's go...
Huh?
Well...
A parakeet?
You didn't mean to what?
It was.
Well Why not?  I gotta make statues Leonard.  You heard Maxwell, they want me to make them.  I can't go back to being a busboy!
Yeah?
Uh, hi.
Yeah yeah yeah - look!  I've heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you're coming with me! Lou goes to turn Walter against the wall but Walter springs back -
I ain't going no place with you!
Turn around!
Uh, I don't know.
I don't!  But fifty thou?  That's not money, that's manna!
With Dead Cat?
A hot light bulb is burning inside of you.  I want to be warmed by it.
I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
I was just straightening up the place.
Let's move out!
Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?
That's it, man.  That's the whole story.
Don't tread on the earth?
Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine.
Hey, it works for me.  If they want to leave you alone in the house, all helpless and vulnerable...
Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
You weren't home.  Like always.
I am so sure.
Why'd you come back?
Besides, Oxnard sucks.
I think I could help.  You gonna tell me you don't need help?
Merrick...
I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.
I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a hundred of them out there.  They'll rip us apart.
You're the boss, boss.  I just thought maybe we should wait.
You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.
Please.  It's so '91.
Well, where?
Please.  They show previews for foreign movies.
Get a boob job.
Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
You look way pretty, Kim.
Time to do what?
I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
In the past.  A girl.  Maybe... A Magyar peasant.  An Indian princess. A slave.
I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
China.
I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies?
Here?
Oh.  I thought... you lead me --
I had to test you.
But you threw a knife at my head!
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...
Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
Excuse me for not knowing about El Salvador.  Like I'm ever going to Spain anyway.  Ooh!
What, it's not weird.  I just cut the stupid hot dog in half.
I was just scared is all.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
Have you guys seen Jeffrey?  The limo never showed, I thought he might be here.
Yes, I'm sure they do.  This place is everything you said it was, Amilyn.
Okay, what else?
Nee sitch.  No way.
Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
Wit-tay.
He is so bald.
Okay.
Seriously, Buffy.  That look was way twisted.  What were you thinking about?
No...  You want me to give him a message?
God, I never thought of that.
They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.
Jesus, Annie, I don't know--
Big League pitchers don't use these.
There are two important psychic conduits called the "pingala" and the "ida".  The pingala starts with the left testicle  and ends at the right nostril.
Much better.  Your delivery was fully integrated because you weren't thinking about it 'cause you were pissed off at me.  This is progress.
It's all the same thing.
Get over here.
Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh--
How 'bout a back rub?
He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.
"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
Well, he fucks like he pitches. Sorta all over the place
I want you desperately!
I doubt that.
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
I'm ready for a complicated man.
Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  Lately I'm not so sure.
Whatta you mean "why not"?  Are you gonna play forever?!
It doesn't work like that.  God, you're gorgeous.  Want to dance?
Not yet.  It takes years of practice...
Annie---
What's it say?
You need a nickname.
You missed the tag!
You spit on me!
You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
Beg me again!
I thought I was--
Well, I held it like an egg.
What do I got?
I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already.  A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.
What?
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.
I know, I know--I have that dream all the time.  We're almost home.
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
What do I gotta do?
Yep.  So how's Annie?
Shut up.  I'm playing.  Oh you won't regret it, young girls don't forget it, lost in their own wilderness ...  But it's all so easy--Just try a little tenderness...
Let go of me!
C ' mon!
You fuck!
No.  Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
Maybe you do.  Y'know I'm starting to like this game--baseball's a helluva good way to make a living.
The Crash Davis. ) And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the Texas League when you were pitching for El Paso and I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and I tattooed it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3-- and I got a free wheel alignment from Goodyear.
Take the first shot at me.
From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
No way.
C'mon, Meat.  You can't hit me 'cause you're starting to think about it already, you're starting to think how embarrassing it'll be to miss, how all these people would laugh.  C'mon, Rook--show me that million dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a good idea about the five cent head--
It's a damn easy thing to play with.
If it makes you and mom feel better, go for it.  I gotta run--
...and one helluva guy.
I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril.
Check it out.
Your breaking ball's getting better but ya need a change up.
Don't tell him I told you--he'd break my neck.
This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother-in-law runs the County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town.  There's gotta be a way to work him back in.
Good to see ya.  William would you...
You were never my guest?!
I never comped you?! I don't comp you at least two or three times a month at the Tangiers?!
Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
You were wandering around.
Was I at that dinner?
But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake?
The worst was Blue.
...I will let her in the house for five minutes if you gentlemen will escort her out if she happens not to want to leave. Because I don't - I -
Fine, fine. How's your family?
Hey!
Hey, that's just fuckin' - That's bullshit. You know, you know, what the fuck?
Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...
...listen to me very carefully. I want to talk to Ginger. I want my kid back. I want her put on a plane immediately.
I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me.
Well...
Wh-wh -
What happened? What happened? Who did this to you?
You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
Why, somebody's complaining?
I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book.
All right.
Nope, there's no way.
Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
Nicky wanted to take over. He wanted to go after Gaggi, go after the skim, go after everything and everybody.
The problem was, Nicky was not only bringin' heat on himself, but on me too. The FBI watched every move he made. But he didn't care. He just didn't care.
Practice enough this week, you prick?
No, a...
Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker.
I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know...  She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.
Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
Hey, be fuckin' nice. Calm. Be nice. Don't fuck up in here.
How do you do?
Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
I'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way, I cannot have a man like that workin' here.
Yeah, refill'd be great.
Well, sir, I was just...
I...
Here we go. Good luck.
I'll be right back.
See you, Ginger.
She was a queen around the casino. She brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money.
But mostly...
Thanks a lot.
No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
What're you... what're you pitching me, here?
Right?
The only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in a bank.
Okay.
Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean...
Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.
Good, so then you could tell me what the money is for.
Yeah, how do I know?
I said, you can't make me stop caring about people.
If not for me, at least for Amy.
Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff.
Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself.
What do you mean?
I gotta tell ya...
...twenty-five thousand?
He wanted a watch, too.
I bought him a watch too.
Yeah.
At the most, which is impossible for him.
Fine.  I'm takin' Amy.
Who were you with?
I was with somebody.
I mean, it could get us both killed.
I should have -
Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
You ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me!
But it was just mine.
They had all the pieces they needed.
Good evening, everyone, I'm Paige Novodor.  What should have been a routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam
Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off.
Ye-yeah.
All right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want?
Yeah.
Mm.
You gotta go back out there.
You're goin' out to Las Vegas, you're havin' a good time at my expense. What the fuck? I mean, after all, you're the one having a good time, not me.
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep.
He won't...
Go get a bag, man.
Lady, I can't. I can't. I ca-
I can't.
It looked like a fuckin' gun!
He's gone?
Oh, thanks, Eddy.
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
But I'm just trying to leave.
You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
I'll tell him, Remo.
What could I say? I knew if I gave the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've would up gettin' killed.
Okay.  Frankie, you're a good boy.
T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy? 
Mm.
I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
He gives a fuck what I do?
Yeah.  Thanks.
You're so nice. 
Yeah, uh-huh... Okay.
See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust.
Yeah. 'Cause, you know,  He's never gonna give me my jewelry.
No, he wouldn't. I would have.  And he'd've been right, too. I mean, seriously.  Well, there's one thing you don't do. You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.
I need some help. I do. I need some help.  You gotta help me. I need a new sponsor, Nicky.
Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Get the fuck out!
I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
Thank you. Very nice.
What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
Okay?
I'm here.
I'm always here for you.
Promise?
I just talked to him.
Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?
She started it. She started the whole thing. I'm just standin' here.
Listen...
I think that's it.
Two.
Two?
Yeah?
Nicky sends his warmest regards.
Yeah, but they're complaining.
They want a fuckin' war, I'm ready.
What? Get out of here? I got a marker comin'.
I know. I know.
Yeah.
Shh.  Hide her car in the back!
Take it easy!
Get her the fuck out of here. Get her out of here.
All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
I'm sorry.
That's enough.
Yeah.
I'll bet. Funny, for some reason, I don't think dogs are supposed to like me.
You say that like an amnesia victim.
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
What little boy doesn't?
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
Oh come on, Cactus, be a man!  The blimp is still on schedule, right?
At this point, a nap. Oh by the way, I killed your butler and your dog..
I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
Do you have any idea how much superheroes get paid?  Zilcho. Urban vigilantes with secret identities operating outside the law. Not exactly the stuff of a W-2 form.  If it wasn't for merchandising and corruption and these diabolical "missions"...There is no such thing as heroes and villains, anymore, Selina.  There are only winners and losers. You lost. We won.
Whatever you say...Sis.
What if I were to say "You're Fired?"
Kelly, get to work on those new uniforms.  I'm not running a summer camp here..
What is it with women and Catwoman? Men have the courtesy to punish the weak, but women love punishing the strong. Don't get me wrong--this Catwoman is a terrifying, subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. It's just, I like her a lot.
I actually got some memory back last night.
Well. I'd let you come in, but the place is a mess...
Yes, you shouted the words "Captain God" at me for no reason...
Like you don't know...
I'll let you know.
What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
Maybe.
I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.
Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
Thanks.
Do I hear a woman's voice?
Matter of fact I did have a kid once.  But he's a lot better off with his father in Milwaukee.
This Mercedes of yours, what's it look like?
Then whose is it?
I'm going to level with you officer.
Bear right till the fire road ends.  It's not far.
Bullshit.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
Let's hope so.  Once you come out and okay everything I'll give Caitlin the sign that she can bring the painting on over.
Satisfied, Wiseass?
Will you let me explain!
And what're you whispering for?
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
I realize you don't want to be involved.
I am not involved.  Keep clicking your little wires.  You'll get someone else.  Good luck.
No -- nothing.
No!  No police.  They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  They'll kill us. We've seen their faces.
Listen, there's an overpass coming up.  I may lose you for a minute.
Please.
What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried.
What do you mean?
It won't be him.
Theo, I want you to know, you're probably the most decent man I've ever met.
Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?
Are you okay?
He's in back.  Lying face down. They haven't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying.  I never heard Jack cry before --
Now you're going to do just what I tell you to.  No discussion.  No hesitation.
I'm not leaving my daughter behind.  Not with them.
She's next.  In two or three more minutes she'll be free.
So far they're keeping their part of it.
Hand me the phone.
Damned if I know.
Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
Not all.  They already have a third.  The question is how much of that are they willing to give to get you back?
I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
You wouldn't --
Yes I would.  Not kill you.  But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution.  It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --
Then scream for me.  A repeat performance.  Let me see how easy you can turn it on.  Scream!  I want to hear you scream for me!
Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  All parts intact.
Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen.  We cleared some of these same roads.
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
I told you ... sooner or later you'd have to trust me ...
Keep talking.
Some loyalty.
There's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass.
You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
We're waiting for the light to cross the highway.  It just changed.  We're in a grey van.  It reads "<u>Noble Carpet Cleaners</u>."
Next I want to see Rachel.  Put her on the phone before she gets out so her mother can tell her exactly what to do.  Keep her calm.  Tell her you're fine and that she can join you in this car.
And if you ditch us we get zilch.
It's in your interest, Nels, since the additional passenger in my trunk -- an LAPD officer is probably carrying a few bullets in him traceable to the piece you're carrying.  Tell the man.
From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman.  There's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it. The cops'll plow right into you.
You couldn't be calling at a worse time, Nels.
Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
Take the 405 south.
We're gonna get there first.
Nobody can do anything right but you!
If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.
Undercover.
Is that good or bad?
Nice.
I've no thoughts on the subject.
Hi, Jimmy.
Cunt.
Charming.
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Fuck off back to Essex!
Take your fucking goldfish, too!
It's a simple question.
Not English.
And what's it like?
Like treacle.
They all get the wrong idea.
Yes, thank you.
Perform?
Why?
Jesus.
As different as it's possible to be.
Maybe.
The thing is, can you go the distance?
Told you, I'm superstitious.
All the time.
He looks after me. He's a gentleman too.
Where?
What you doing here?
Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.
Give it over, Dil --
Must be.
And the fact that you didn't know is basically the fault of yours truly. And even when you were throwing up, I could tell you cared.
Shut up.
Nothing's wise.
Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that.
Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
Absolutely.
Only if you kiss me.
No.
It's a secret.
No! Tell me everything, Jimmy.
You mean that?
You knew my Jody?
In a manner of speaking.
Just don't kick Dil and she'll be touched. Be nice to her and she'll be yours forever.
I know you're lying, Jimmy, but it's nice to hear it.
Stop it, Dil --
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
Absolutely. The younger the better. Doesn't come your way much, I suppose.
Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
That's wise, Tommy.
There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.
He's all right.
Hasn't moved for twelve hours. Go on. Have a heart.
Fucking do. I had him all over me.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
You're never out, Fergus.
Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche. You know we won't leave her out of this. But I'm glad to see you care.
Aye. Then we'll leave her be.
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
Stay late at your work tomorrow night and I'll bring you the gear.
Some judge...
He described me down to a T. Knows what Jude looks like.
You're on duty. Keep your fucking mouth shut. Go in and get some sleep.
I'm sure.
Okay. You're a good man, Fergus.
So it's on the street.
Kind of suicide, isn't it?
Yeah.
You're going to have to do it, aren't you?
Not in your nature.
Shut the fuck up, would you?
No?
Why?
Having a pint in the Rock.
I didn't.
You liked her?
Don't know her.
Want you to do something, Fergus.
I don't know. Just help me. Give me a cigarette.
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
What you say, faster?
People. They could be looking.
He believes in the future --
Give me the fucking shooter!
 I'll tell you what, fella -- you want t' find me, you jus' turn 'round -- from now on I'll be right behind you. 
It's simple. I like what I do -- I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time.
Is there a Mrs. Canfield?
I think that's what you ordered.
Why do you think I brought you here?
Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
Well -- come on.
To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
Yes, you told me.
Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
But Charles' appointment was last week, not --
Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?
Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that!  Oh, dear.
Ours.
Look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- look just as hard and as fast as you can. You may not have a great deal of time. Those men know you have it just as surely as we do. You won't be safe until the money's in our hands. Is that clear?
Well, there you are! Charles had the money with him -- so whoever killed him has it -- they have it!
Were you followed?
You mean you've known about him all along? Why didn't you tell me?
I told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother.
Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?
Then how do I know this is your office?
What's your first name today?
Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one.
Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
Then who does?
It's the only name I've got. How about you?
How can I? You lied to me -- the way Charles did -- and after promising you wouldn't. Oh, I want to believe you, Peter... oh, but I can't call you that anymore, can I? It will take me a while to get used to your new name -- which I don't even know yet. What is it?  Aren't you going to tell me?  Hello -- ?
Would you like to see my passport?
Alexander.
Said what?
Whoever it is won't give up -- and neither will I.
You're a big help. Can I have one of those?
Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
I don't believe it.
Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around -- I want you to believe that.
No -- not yet.
But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?
Carson Dyle didn't have a brother.
It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
Here's ten.
And if it is?
I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire. Would you be so kind as to come with me, please?
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
He was a wealthy man?
Yes. Your appointment has been changed.  One key to your apartment -- one comb -- one fountain pen --  one toothbrush -- one tin of tooth powder  -- that is all.
I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Félix lives?
It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
Don't you know I could already be arrested for transporting a minor above the first floor?
How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
Good night.
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
How do you know what they're doing?
Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.
No -- no, I'm don't.
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
He took care of Charlie for us.
Who invited you?
I think I know how to restore your reputation.
Can I come in? I'll need to use the phone.
Exactly. Then he must be a virgin.
You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
That's impossible.
Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.
How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
I will. Is that all?
A little.
No honey.
We need you here. I can bring her in.
We're seeing all the signs in town.
She resides there. Out back. She died a year and a half ago.
Shh. I'm not going to tell you not to go.
Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
You're going to look really amoebic splitting off from me now.
But you can't do any of it. So it sucks. I always have to 'set an example'.
Does she fuck?
I was desperate. It was gross.
Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.
Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.
I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference.
I can't right now.
Twenty eight years ago.
Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
Mom?
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
You didn't believe her?
They were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. And she was  a loner. An angry girl that no one really liked. She'd called them 'queers'.
Who was the fourth?
I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
Hide your laptop here.
No.
You can't bring it.
EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT.
...shit.
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY.
Well, he told me to collect cash.
...two things Andy is not.  Uh, but I tell you what.
That'll make up the difference, huh?
Hang on.  Hang on.
Look, if I don't get this stuff to McGruder, it's goodbye, Andy's Ice Cream, goodbye, Jerome, goodbye, Mon-...
...-tana.
You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my...
...truck.
You are not takin' my truck!
Look, put this in the back.  Keep it safe.
What the hell is with you, dog?  He's the one with the damn gun.

Am I missing somethin' here?
You stole this truck! That's...

I was thankin' you, asshole!
...reconsider that statement there, Night Shift.  You're psy-...
Hi--!  The gun was empty!
I did not steal the truck.
...man!
Oh, shit.


You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye, buddy! 
Oh, shit.
That's right.  Now,  move!
Come on, old Pete.
...easy, easy, easy.

All right, you got it, you got it!
 Oh...
...ho!
All right.
Okay.  All right.  Okay. 
You're--?  What?!


Hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out...
You're fucked, man.
And he swore, he swore once I got a degree...
...truck.
So I took his truck, yeah.
We were nationally  ranked.
Started every game my senior year.  Not all-American or anything, but not bad. Anyway, the real star was my best friend, the quarterback.  Got taken in the first round.
I remember him.  Got in a car crash or somethin'.
And I put the car into a ditch.  He spent eighteen weeks in the...

Not completely, anyway.

...deal with this asshole.
...or my conscience.
Yeah, I know, I know.

Huh?

You got Elvis?!
Forty-five seven!
I'm gonna kill him.
Come on.  Come on.
 There's gotta be...
...another way  outta here.    Hey.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

They aren't exactly gonna publicize this,  Arlo. 
Who had to put a gun to your head?
Thank you.
What about all that "no need to get in the man's...
...face" crap you've been telling me?
Look.  That's negotiating? He threatened to kill...
Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls.
Yeah.
 you see, that was a-that was my mission.
That's right.
 ...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.
  Hey, actually...
No, sir.  I've never seen this guy before.
...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
Exactly.
...-listed personnel with detailed knowledge of classified secrets falling under the National Security Act.
...including the permanently extreme.
Alert seventy-fifth rangers.  Code Blue. Tell them Elvis has left the building.
...to be off the island tonight.
Sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation?
The NSA thinks the UN is onto your work...
...not at all like a man responsible for the deaths of eighteen peo-...
...and the government.
Went away? 
Why is it you scientists can create implements of destruction...
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.
EXT. MOUNTAINTOP - DAY.
Just when we have all the cards, Vaughn.  Take these two behind the van.
Get 'em in the  middle of the dam.
Sir.
Carl, Dennis, get out of sight.
Right.  Tim Mason.
...-fall.
Jesus Chri--  We're on a very slippery slope here, Sam.  A covert military operation riddled with civilian...
Where's their protective...
I assume you want that to go.
...dangerous.
...and a rifle.  You, on the other hand...
...look like you're after something more dangerous.
Bring him up.
It won't be long, gentlemen.
No.
Dead, last time I...



...and then my night man shows up when he feels like...
Darlene, it's five-thirty.  Now, I worked late for you this mornin', and you didn't wanna spring for over-...
Oh, you're two of a kind, doc.  Oh, he may not have your sheepskins, and...
EXT. DAM - DAY.
...tight!
Gomez, you fight the battles you can win.  Now, we've been outmaneuvered here.  Brynner's next move is gonna be to get Elvis out of the country and sell him to the highest bidder.  To do that, he has to have planned an exit point.  That's where we intercept him.  That's where we make our play.  Now you and your men back off.
What's going on, colonel?

...colonel?
Couldn't sleep, Pumper.  Is everything, uh, all right tonight?

He's brains without ambition...
...and that power...
Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees.
Well,  Costello's finished with the stability profile, but Abbott is still chewing on the load file.
We don't have an hour.  We're already supposed to be shut down.
 ...miles. 
Yeah.
...badge someday, then you can ask the questions.  Until then...
Shut your mouth until I tell you...
...any idea what's goin' on here?!
His name's Vitelli.  Talk to him.  He's right out-...
What happened to Colonel Brynner?
...we're all gonna die in this...
 
EXT. ICE CREAM TRUCK - DAY.
Heat's murder.
Sir, this is not a lending library, it's the Hall of Records.
Would you call him a capable man?
Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?
Yes, his girlfriend.
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
No. She's probably scared to death.
Maybe.
I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves.
I've got her.
What is it?
That's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them...  you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city.
Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. after all. It's very simple.
Who do you blame for that? Her?
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
Oh they don't?
No thanks.
Curly, where's your car?
In the garage.
Sure, as soon as we eat.
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.
Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.
I'll throw that in too.
How are you, Lou?
I get by.
Since when?
I'd like to talk to him.
You mean that's what you're going to call it.
When I do, you'll hear about it.
Just to be on the safe side, we had Loach here give you a ring.
This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.
Yeah?
I heard it was an accident.
C'mon, you think you're dealing with a bunch of assholes? Mulwray had salt water in his goddam lungs! Now how did he get that... in a fresh water reservoir?
Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou.
He found out somebody was dumping water there. That's what they were trying to cover up by moving him.
Shut up.  Go on.
Matter of fact I do.
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
Gee, thanks, Lou.
Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.
Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question?
Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.
That's not his apartment.
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
How did you find out?
He told you?
Did you have affairs?
I don't see anyone for very long, Mr. Gittes.  It's difficult for me. Now I think you know all you need to about me. I didn't want publicity. I didn't want to go into any of this, then or now. Is this all?
No reason.
No. I'm just a snoop.
More like other people putting their business in my nose.
I'll pay your salary plus five thousand dollars if you find out what happened to Hollis and who is involved.
The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.
No, I think I'd remember.
I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
Your eye.
The police?
I will if you don't.
Sure.
Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.
Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. Why?
What did you do that for?
To Mexico...
How about a plane?
He didn't wear bifocals.
But, Mr. Gittes.
Three reservoirs. Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower, and the Pig 'n Whistle.
Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.
I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
I wonder if you'd care to wait in my office?
He never even kids about it.
Maybe he takes it very seriously.
I'm sorry, I --
Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, I thought I'd drop by and see who died lately.
Yeah. Banged up pretty bad.
Yeah, I'll do that.
May I ask what this is regarding?
It's personal. Has he been out long?
He was expecting you?
I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.
Yes. No.
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
No, no. She said not to call, her husband might answer.
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
Cross was looking for her all over the country. Offered rewards, everything. Felt real sorry for him, with all his money.
Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh? 
Sssssh, Be quiet, pretend everything's normal. I'm Salvatore.
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
It takes years to get there. And years to come back...Now go to bed, Toto, it's late.
Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!
We certainly do.  Vacation's over - starting right after dinner.  But right now - that lady over there -  - that's the new society editor, I take it?  You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?
That's right.  They called us the "Three Musketeers."
Certainly not.
Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the "Enquirer" - who were with the "Chronicle" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the "Chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?
I wanted him to have fun - and with me along -
Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.
Yes - Mr. Kane.
Thank you.  I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -  I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.
There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?
He's paying for it, Emily.  Those returns tonight - he's finished. Politically -  - socially, everywhere, I guess. I don't know about the papers, but -
Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
You're a cheap, crooked grafter - and your concern for your children and your mother -
If you want to come in and wash your face -  I can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers -
No.  They've passed on.
No.  That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -
You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and - 
And I know too many people.  Obviously, we're both lonely.  Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
Well, I -
Oh, no, that's all gone.
Half past eleven.
Half past eleven.
You're my wife, Susan, and -
Susan, I really think -
Don't tell me you're sorry.
Yes.
- And left?  Of course they'll hear.  I'm not saying goodbye - except to you - but I never imagined that people wouldn't know.
I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President!  I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks!
If you're interested in what people say, Signor Matisti, I may be able to enlighten you a bit.  The newspapers, for instance.  I'm an authority on what the papers will say, Signor Matisti, because I own eight of them between here and San Francisco...  It's all right, dear. Signor Matisti is going to listen to reason.  Aren't you, maestro? 
Can you prove it isn't?
The trouble is, Mr. Thatcher, you don't realize you're talking to two people.
Yes, sir -
It's a wall you bought in China, Mr. Kane.
A wasted day.
It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social!  The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes -  I tell you, Brad, I envy you.  By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -
Good.
They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
What?
Nothing - if she dosen't love me -
Hello, Charlie -  I didn't know we were speaking.
I can remember everything.  That's my curse, young man.  It's the greatest curse that's ever been inflicted on the human race.  Memory -  I was his oldest friend.  As far as I was concerned, he behaved like swine.  Maybe I wasnt' his friend.  If I wasn't, he never had one.  Maybe I was what nowadays you call a stooge -
Hey, Nurse!
Queer?
Yeah.  I guess he wasn't very happy those last years - he didn't have much reason to be -
I had a toothache.
He married you, didn't he?
Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?
Rosebud?
Are you sure?
What the hell is that?
It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
You've made a wise choice. Keep up the good work.
If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers.
Like I'm responsible for all the smokers!
What can I say? He does weird things to me.
You can hold me down.
There's no light back there.
Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.
Such a sordid state of affair.
And I'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss, and my desire to piss with the light on.
It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know?  And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
I feel nauseous.
I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month...
Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.
The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
Stop it. He's a nice guy.
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
You mean, on a date?
I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
Who doesn't?
I left like an hour ago.
I'm not fooling around!  Who went back there?
Oh God...
Shock trauma. She's going to need years of therapy after this. My question is, How did she come to have sex with the dead man?
This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
What responsibility? You're closing the fucking store to play hockey.
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
No, thanks.
Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
That's cheating?
That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl "Mom."
Oh, my God.
...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
And the second time around...?
Wait.
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  He's led a very sheltered life.
I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
Let's hear it.
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
Can we not talk about this?
Then where're we gonna play?
Exactly. They drank it all.
I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.
No, I'm serious.
Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.
Stop it. This is beneath even you.
You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
Exactly, which means I can't close it for another hour so we can both go to a wake.
That's embarrassing?
Because I never tried to suck my own dick?
No, because you won't admit to it. As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. You're as curious as the rest of us, pal. You've tried it.
His dick was in his mouth?
He made it, hunhh?
Reach what?
What, your dick?
We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST video, respectively. As such, we have certain responsibilities which-though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning our posts until closing.
It's going to have to do for now, considering that it's my car that's up for request.  Can I help you?
You're a danger to both the dead and the living.
You're bullshitting.
Then how come you got the fine?
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
This is my way of spitting water at life.
Bunch of savages in this town.  Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.
I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.
I was born.
Fuck you.
All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.
Am I right or what?
What? The dead guy?  She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.
So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change?
My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.
Lovely story.
Point is-I'm not the kind of person that disrupts things in order to shit comfortably.
What time did you get to work today?
You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
I'm her sister.
THE GLADES MOTEL?
I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.
I don't know.
Yeah?
To you?
Hey man, that was a long time ago. Don't let it get to you.
'Bout the biggest pair you ever seen! NYNNE!!
Pay the good man.  Don't you close soon?
That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.
Lasagne.
Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
I'm not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony?
Jesus... go ahead.
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
You're trusting.
Why do you say that?
Including you?
It better be up to and including me.
I'm not the pig you are.
Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around.
Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood.
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
I'm going to class.
Well... why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?!
Really?  You're the best.
I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!
I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?
I didn't do that!
But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kid!
You gotta hear him sing.  Olaf, "Berserker!"
Wait, there's more.  Olaf: sing... 
I don't fucking know. What am I, his biographer?  Olaf, what part of Russia are you from?
He's moving to the big city next week. He wants to be a metal singer.
Does he sing in English or Russian?
Well, how about these two movies? 
I hope it feels so good to be right. There is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?
You'll be missed.
After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
You came for that too? That's the movie I came for.
Do you still talk to Sylvan?
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.
Jessie, girl this is insane. Weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight.
You're getting warmer!
I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
Look, I know--
Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.
Not on that leg.
You keep it.  Get up there if you can, and if you get a chance, do me a favor and kill him.
I'm sorry for all the trouble... Thank you.
One...
Help me!  I don't want to die!
I don't think you do.
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
From one professional to another, of course.
No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience.
Where?
It doesn't matter, anywhere but here.
That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.
What if he can't?
Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?
Making things real rough for Hal.
Breathtaking.
If we don't get out of here soon we can ask him in person.
We gotta get out and fire a flare.  It's the only chance!
Do it, goddammit!
Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
Take the rope.
Enough's enough.  How could anybody in their right mind... then again, you never were in your right mind.
There's a lot more where that came from.  You're not leaving again?
Now you get burned.
What the hell's going on?
Ryan, get a rope, I want the man on a leash, too.
Jessie, I reached the top of the Tower.  So far, no sign of anyone.  Looks like a phoney call. Over.
No, he's gone.
Anyone else following?
It looks like a winding route.
Half a day.
There.  You blind?
Then it's a deal.
The monitor! I never ask twice.
What about it?
We're down to a few hours before the whole world shows up here.  Where's the next one?
You dumb bastard, you waited too long.  If he made it back, this place would have been covered with police in a few hours.  The way we're moving, it's going to be anyway.
Appreciate it.
You're the boss.  Let's head out to the tarmac.  Matheson, have you been totally briefed?
Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?
I... I'm very sorry, but I never open. I'm very sorry but I never open the door to strangers after dark.
Very well, madam. I suppose you can't be blamed for being suspicious with so many scoundrels and rouges of the night about. Alex walks away from door, then ducks into the bushes where the others are hiding. They put on their maskies and follow Alex round to the rear of the house.
Naughty, naughty, naughty, you filthy old soomaka.
Much better, thank you, sir.
Well, as I've said, we've heard about you. We are interested in your case. We want to help you.
Alright, Mum... have a nice day at the factory.
Hullo love, how are you?  Nice to see you, Dad.
Just a manner of speech, sir.
A big black mark I tell you for every one we don't reclaim. A confession of failure for every one of you who ends up in the stripy hole.
It will be your own torture. I hope to God it will torture you to madness.
And it just so happened that while they were showing me a particularly bad film, of like a concentration camp, the background music was playing Beethoven.
Snuff it, sir... um... death, I mean, missus... Er... I just want to die peacefully like with no... pain.
Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You're a big strong chelloveck like us all. We're not little children, are we, Georgie Boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation. Georgie backs down.
Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.
Thank you, sir.
Where is he now, sir?
You must have an interesting job at a salary which you would regard as adequate. Not only for the job which you are going to do and in compensation for what you believe you have suffered, but also because you are helping us.
Good... good boy. Oh yes, I understand you're fond of music. I have arranged a little surprise for you.
Thank you, Fred. Thank you. Minister turns and signals. Door opens and a crowd of cameramen and reporters rush in. Aides push two 6-foot loudspeakers and a Hi-Fi on a trolley.
Well - I'm back.
What about Basil? Where's my snake?
Why did you do that, brother? I've never done wrong to you.
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
Pick that up and put it down properly. Alex does so, and continues to empty his pockets.
No, sir.
Brown hair, is it?
Yes, sir.
You've heard Beethoven before?
Fine. Fine.
Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
What are we going to do? Talk about me sex life?
Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
Right... Knickers... Cabbages... It doesn't have a beak. Alex laughs. Slide of woman speaking to boy.
Yes.
Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul.
Are you now, or ever have been, a homosexual?
We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
The Bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges.
The ride is free.
Dmitri hired him!  He's already killed all your witnesses, now he's coming after you!  He was stalking you when I dropped you off.  I don't know what happened, but he diverted and got into my cab, instead.
Save me the grief.  Step out of the car, sir, and open the trunk.
Jesus...
Most vividly.  "St. Louis Blues," "Potato Head Blues," "Sleepy Time Down South..."  ...then Pops laid some "Cornet Chop Suey" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog.
It's simple.  What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument?
I think...  ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
You tell me.  I had to toss the list in the river.  I was protecting your sorry, long-winded ass.  So why don't you show a little courtesy?
Can you finish on schedule?
...so, his description of Max the cabdriver matches the guy who walked out of Villa Rodeo.  That guy?  That guy is a cabbie.  And you're telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and emerges as a meat eater, assassin with heavy trigger time? What's he do, squeeze 'em in between fares?
Oh, right.  The guy flipped out or something?  Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
Cabbie had no criminal record, no history of mental illness.  Suddenly, he just wigs out and pops three people, then himself?  Plus the victims weren't random solid citizens. They were all lowlives.  Wiseguys.  I've always wondered if there was someone else in the cab.
Joey Cicerno.  Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov.  Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri.
Pick me up in five minutes.
Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
Vincent...
Yesss, you are.  He's artistic.
Vincent.  It was nice to meet you. Visit again?
Nothin'!  Aside from Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow!  Get him on the line, please.
Where you been the last two hours? Your mother's been calling every ten minutes whining about how you didn't show up.
...I'm sorry, I don't see it that way...
...well, last I checked, you were <u>sleeping</u> with me, so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon, I'd suggest an attitude shift...
Third, but I still can't tell uptown from downtown.  Tell the truth, whenever I'm here, I can't wait to leave.  Place gets to me.  Too loud, too fast...too much.  You like it here?
It's home.
You share it with over three million people every day.  You know that's the population of New Zealand?  What's Manhattan, thirteen miles long? That's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles.  Read about this one guy.  Gets on the subway and dies.  Six hours he's riding around before anybody notices. Think about that.  Here's this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the New York transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. Three million.  That's too damn many people.
I'll make it an even five hundred. Plus an extra hundred if you get me to LAX on time.
No.  You say you're cool.
I don't think I can do this.
It's just a dead guy.  On three, ready?  Uno.  Dos.  Three.
It's not me.
Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One...
I tried it.
Okay, try it now.
South Central.
Listen.  I'm not trying to piss you off, see?  Okay?  I can't drive you around so you can murder folks.
Rwanda-Burundi.  Central Africa.
Tens of thousands killed before sundown.  Nobody's killed that fast since Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Did you bat an eye, Max?  Join Amnesty International?  No.  I off one Angeleno, you throw a hissy fit...
Why?
Friend of mine told me about this great place in South Central.  Says it's like the birthplace of West Coast bebop.  Bird.  Dexter Gordon. Thelonious Monk.  Chet Baker.  I'll buy you a drink.  Expand your horizons...
Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...
Doesn't cover everything.
You get benefits?
Who's Heller?
I shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you?
One more.
You're full of shit.
What'd they do?
...all the cabbies in LA, I pull Max, the man with X-ray vision...
Look in the mirror.  ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros.  How much you got saved?
...pie in the sky?  "Someday my dream'll come..."  But one night you'll wake up and realize suddenly you're old.  It hasn't happened.  It never will.  Life just flipped on you.  Tomorrow became yesterday.  Then you'll bullshit yourself it was never gonna happen, anyway, and push it back in memory...and anesthetize yourself in a Barcalounger with daytime TV for the rest of your life...  Don't talk to me about murder.  You're <u>do-in</u>' yourself...in this yellow prison with steel-belted radials. Clocking in and out everyday...
Slow down.
Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
You switched the charts; you tell me.
<u>Heart attacks happen</u>.
Don't tell me you're naked back there.
That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out.  A lot of people are after you, Jerry.
Um, coffee.  If that's okay?
Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
Uh huh.
It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
Please put it down.
He was murdered.
You watch me, don't you?
Where'd you get your subscribers?
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
Cold War's over, Jerry.
They're big details, Jerry.
Okay, I will.
Thanks.
This way.
Come on.
Did you kill my father?!
I'm sorry.
Jerry...?  <u>Jerry</u>.
Where are you?
I can't promise you anything.
Lysergic acid diethylamide... With a little kicker of my own.  Surely it must be coming back to you by now?
You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
That's your option.  Ours could be to keep you locked up for a very long time.  In case you didn't know it, you're crazy.
That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
Terminal?
Me?  I was a minor missionary, a heretic really.  But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs?  Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance.
If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live.  Why are you telling me all this?
So you'll believe what I tell you next.  Because I need to find Jerry.  And I don't think I can do that without you.
This doesn't make sense.
What do you mean?
Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
What do you suggest?
That you come with me.
How is that possible?  How could all that information be encoded in --
So?
I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
And only two probabilities:  One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --
'President's Science Advisor' -- so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...?
No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.
You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...
I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  This is absurd, David.  We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
Actually I'm running late --
Thank you?
It could be anything.  The first volume of some Encyclopedia Galactica...
A transport.  So are they coming or are we going?
Well --
We've repeated.  A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
This is how you see the sky?
It's beautiful.
I'm saying you might have consulted us; the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive...
On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.
Am I artifact or dream?  You might ask that about anything.
The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
So.  What happens now?
-- even if he doesn't receive the entire transmission.  Heaven is the mustard seed.
A machine.  But a machine that does what?
We've just lived through a century of incredible violence and self- destruction.  Do you call it 'interventionist' when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck?
You're implying that the whole selection process is a sham?
It's beautiful but it does get a little lonely.  Sometimes I think the reason we build these things in such godforsaken places isn't to avoid excess radio traffic but because we're all such pathetic antisocial misfits... Speaking of which:  How're you getting on with the old man?
'... is indistinguishable from magic.'
Any luck on the grant money?
This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
'The work,' Jesus, Ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work?  Okay, maybe that's the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes --
That you, Valerian?
Like it or not.
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
And mind, yes.  What are you --
Some of my best friends are scientists.  They're saying the machine is alive.
Not exactly.  It has organic qualities, but we don't really understand how they're integrated with the mechanical systems.
And everybody you care about would be dead and buried.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
Maybe the reason people are having trouble finding meaning isn't because science has obscured it... maybe it's just revealed it isn't there.
I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?
Oh.  I brought you something.
I do seem to be... Maybe because I'm just a little bit terrified about tomorrow.
I'm sorry.
What are you so afraid of?
What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it?  If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave.  Now.  Please.
Have your department make a full report.
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
I've got this weak heart. Too much drinking, I guess. As soon as they find out about it, they'll probably send me someplace else.
Yeah, would of been nice to of knowed him, the way you talk about him.
She took off with that convertible feller...
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
I'm leavin' the place to John.
Gotta go, Arletta.
Ram it in and break it off!
Yeah. Come on out, Luke.
Git to work!
Hey, Tattoo!
You jes' watch us!
'Bout two hours left.
What happened? How far did you get?
Shut up. Let him eat. Don't pay them no mind, boy.
What for?
He's gonna be awright.
A Lucas Jackson.
I just always did like truck rides.
Boy. You jus' asking to be handled!
They ain't never seen a bull gang before.
That's it. That's the end.
Yeah, I know. But what we gotta do first is stretch that l'il ol' belly of yours -- git it all strained out, in fightin' shape, like a barrage balloon.
On my own.
You jus' may be great at hangin' paper around the big cities, but us country boys is not entirely brainless. When it comes to the law, nothin' is understood.
Bet! Babalugats, bet here!
Cuter again.
Damn.
He's gonna lose a finger eating eggs like that.
You threatened to drive her downtown.  She has agoraphobia.
A little homeopathic cure for the willies.
He whispered, but it was <u>him</u>!  I know it was him!
Andy?
But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.
Reminded me that I used to be attractive.  That men used to want me...
You <u>slut</u>!  No sexy young cop for you unless you shampoo your hair.
I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed it.
Hey, no.  Leave those here.  If you really want her help.  I mean if you really do, leave them.  Let her see them.  I'll see they're safe...
Only part.  What else?  What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.
Because people who are suffering from aural hallucinations hear voices in both ears.  Daryll Lee told me that Joan of Arc always appeared beside him on his left side and spoke softly in his left ear.
I was?  How you spell that?
I brought a present for the lady, there.  I'm looking for her, to give her the present...
Who was the man in the basement?
It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?
Do it.  If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  Have enough guts to do it.
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
How do you know that?
Work with me.
I just came from her... here's what you haven't seen.
Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the Festival of Love?  You make any sense in that?
That's no surprise.
You're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style?  That doesn't happen.  These men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual.  The method itself is part of the pleasure...
Helen -- the killer directly contacted you.  His interest in you is <u>intense</u>.  I'm worried about you. I don't want to lose you.  I know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the only direct contact we have with him. The only chance we have to trap him.  So, you can turn Internet back on, or I do, and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick, scream and hyperventilate.
Clint is putting a guard on you. But if you swear to leave the computer on, Winona will assign him to the hall outside.
What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ!  Any God that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button.  Just give me a minute here.  The letter is addressed to me...  You don't feel fear, do you? You're young.  You feel like you'll live forever.  How wonderful.
It's also the major piece of evidence, and it makes you a key part of his plan.  You can't run away from it anymore.  Look at the order he's doing them... He did three as the Boston Strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work.  Then he did one like the Hillside Strang- ler.  And then one as Son of Sam. To lead us on -- to where and what end?  And he's doing more than that -- he's imitating each killer's method as closely as he can -- in details.  Injecting Windex.  Using .44.  Playing Abba.
They get fan letters...
You do that one, I don't want it...
A man?  I thought he was a boy.  This last Christmas was the happiest Christmas I had in the last ten years... you know why?  It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love.  Son of a bitch <u>married men</u>!  Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets crowded and noisy?!
They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph...
He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape.
Go and look for a note.
No.  I didn't.
Who came in after you?
Just horseshit luck.
It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody.
Sure.  She likes <u>you</u>, Rube.  She likes the way you move.  She sure as hell isn't in love with me.
Honest to God, Ruben!
I like women like that!
What about her arms?
Am I in charge of this thing?  Or not.
I said you were...
Good.
What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
I know.  Get out here.
What?  I talk like a cop, this is the way I talk.  I can't believe this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. "Let me help you!"
It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests...
I'm sorry it had to come to your attention.  I am dealing with it.
Helen Hudson...
You have no authority to make a deal like that.  That' s for the D.A...
No, she can come in tomorrow... gonna want to know a lot of things...
She doesn't lie!  You sure you fed her?
She lies all the time.  Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
If I groundloop during my flying lesson on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you.
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
No, I couldn't. I feel too close to her.
I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine.
So - why the airport?
Are we imagining it?
Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.
The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage.
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.
A crude sci-fi concept that floats on the surface and doesn't threaten anybody. I use it to test the resilience of my potential partners in psychopathology.
I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out.
But everything's OK?
You look beautiful.
Look, Mom, I think I've found the dress.
What about the souffle?    Has that gone in?
I'll be back before you can say souffle.
That settles it. I'm never leaving.
Will you get time off to do that?
Paul could pop the question at any time.
I just want to go home.   Can we go home now?
But what about Beast?   Who'll...?
Mottled really.   Green and red.
To talk?  Well, OK, that might be good.
I understand you just got engaged. Maybe that's where we should start.
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
I know this can be a real drag, but the attending physician on day shift is required to do his own prelim exam when a patient is admitted during the night.
Anything interesting.
Good God.
I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
That's where I always go when I get out.
And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
Tell the doctor.
And did you go to the mission?
You're so wrong.
That's Mr. Beast to you.
Sounds grim.
Coming.
Why'd you tell?
Michael, take it easy.
I think I should call someone.
Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK.
Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
Good going. I knew you could do it.
Forget I asked.
So, I've been thinking a lot...
Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
Of course. Yes. I will.     I do.
I don't mean to hurt you.    I know this is a terrible thing.    And I have really loved you.
Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems.
I like those sapphire earrings myself.
No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place.
A pass.
No. I have it. The lamp? The one with your fingerprints and her blood on it?  Remember?
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
Hey, you're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world. I took a shot. It didn't work. Did you bring the tapes?
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
What for? The minute I get him some other Gavone will take his place. I've been doing this for twenty years. When I retire it's not going to be to some trailer park in the suburbs.
They left about a half hour ago.
I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go?
You're calling me on is phone?
Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh.
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
Yeah. That warehouse over on Merchant Street. The volume on our import business has risen dramatically. The proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the --
Yeah -- you do that.
Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
Black market art. Zammito got to a few key security guards at the Metropolitan Museum. The Bastaldi's supplied the artists to make copies of famous works. They'd switch the paintings, send the originals to Paris and the Bastaldi's would sell them to private collectors.
No problem.
Why do I always have to answer the phone?
I'm not any closer than you are.
Where are you from?
This ain't about that and you know it. This is about you never forgiving me for leaving the crew.
Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.
Good idea.
I'll be Elvis and you--
That's Frankie Zammito.   The Under boss of the Chicago Mafia.
Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.
No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
Hey, idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car.
I don't give a shit about your cousin's car. We're here about my car. So, shut your mouth! You think you can do that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut?
What'd they take?
If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?
Just find them!
Okay boss.
And the other car?
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
What room number?
Oh yeah.
Go where?   The police are outside.
Oh, then we will have the house wine.
You can use my car.
This kind.
How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
I don't know.     It's gotta be millions.
Okay.   You can be Elvis.
Give it to me, Sami.
I said a clean break.
And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
I don't know what you're talking about.
The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow.
Take a nap.
Something like that.
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
That's why we're only breaking one arm.
I didn't have the heart.
Then leave her to me.
That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.
You're already a thief.
If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me.
He is my defeated foe!
Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long.
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
How so?
They forced me to marry!
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
Spare your energy.  I'll be back!
Give me back my comb.
And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit.  He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb.
Let them look.
It's time for me to leave it behind.
First I must visit my master's grave.  It's been many years since Jade Fox murdered him.  I have yet to avenge his death.  And yet I'm thinking of quitting.  I must pray for his forgiveness.
But something is going on at the Yu household.
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's.  Were you involved?
It was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.
I don't know it was stolen until I got here.
You did your job well.  But, this girl... I saw her last night.
It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
I wish there were something more I could do to help you.
Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.
To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.
Use it to meditate.  Free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  Do not waste it... for me.
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master.  Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.
I doubt it.  This thief... it very unusual...
What does it say?
They make you fart.
Fucking A, my friend.
Leave here.  Don't do this.  I don't want you here.
No.
You gotta go now, I bet.
Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps for you.
I took yours from you.  Your little girlfriend?  I took hers, too.  Your meaningless, petty life?  I took it so that tonight your existence might gain a purpose.  You're no avenger. You're mine.
Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.
Interested?  Follow the crow.
Very well, it's your ass.
18k.  Crap.
I'll be fine.
His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.
You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.
Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
A friend wrote me.
This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
I sincerely doubt it.
Give me the fucking letter.
Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you.  You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
I'm busy.
Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind.
Of Human Bondage.
I'm doing some volunteer work.
"I actually feel good about myself?"
I did. We played three games of backgammon and...
Yes it does.
I can't win with you.
Lighten up.
You don't know Monsieur Philipe?
Because I'm in love with you.
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
That's not fair.
Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
Hi.
Sure.
Don't think it's not going to cost you.
Doctor King is my favorite.
Absolutely.
Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.
Okay.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
Well do you like him?
What do you mean?!
Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did.
I want to go home.
Of course. I'm not a monster.
Good night Cecile.
Don't you want to change that?
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
Baby?  Right on time.
I'm pretty sure she did.
Pretty sure or sure sure?
I'll be in touch.
Outstanding.
So that's what this is all about.  We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
I'll think about it...
It would feel so yummy.
Loser.
Well, let me know when you do. Until then.
Who are you spying on?
She's really getting to you, isn't she?
And that's why you're losing your bet?
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
Exactly the opposite.
I want to fuck.
Is that what you think?
Then do me a favor and get rid of her. If not for me, then do it for you. Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's turned you into jelly. What do you want to be, one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling. People used to respect you. They feared you and now you're going to throw that all away.
I knew this guy last summer in the Hamptons. He and his girlfriend at the time were madly in love with each other. But she had this huge weight problem. His friends taunted him mercilessly about it. You know, "How do you breathe when she sits on your face?" "It's embarrassing for you to be seen with her." Finally he couldn't take it anymore and decided to dump her. She flipped and he went on the defensive. I distinctly remember him saying the same thing over and over again. "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up."  Poor fatty never had a chance.
Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
Not that it's any of your business but yes.
Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette.
Will you calm down?
I think you have your answer.
War it is.
I'll do my best.
What about her?
I've already told you, she's not home.
Do you know where she is?
Do you mind if I check upstairs?
Don't worry about it.
How will I get to her?
It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
Did you hit her?
But you don't keep a cat, do you?
I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.
But quite harmless, I'm sure.
But where did you get it, Amy?
Are they nice?
Sh! Then you must keep it true. Goodnight, darling.
You can't open it yet. You have to put all of them under the tree until morning.
Amy's been lying again.
I'm sorry. I was somewhere else. He returns to the card game.
Your birthday, Amy --  as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my locker. A present.
But I told you about that so long ago; you couldn't have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.
But, Amy, that was just a story; it wasn't real.  That tree's no mailbox.
But you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.
They ran away.
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
Don't you see her?...Right there, under the tree.
She's upstairs.. .the lady who lives up there.
You called me by my name.
Oh, I like the sound of that.., Amy and her friend... Amy and her friend.
Whenever you want.
I'll just never learn arithmetic.
Of course,
That one's an elm.
Pretend, darling.  It's All Soul's Eve.  Round about the fire we go...  Over the flames we leapt
My dolls. We can pretend.
A merry Christmas to you, Amy.
You wanted to share this moment with me.
Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
But what happened to the little deer?
Then I'll tell you a story — a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
Don't you read Shakespeare?
The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died.
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
Yes...yes, that's true.
And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
We'll see that she gets there in good time
What's with her? If they're not bleeding they're PMSing. If they're not PMSing, they're warning you about the impending doom. If you're lucky, you get a sane person one week a month. Then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life.
My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
Can we get some service here?
Yeah that's like a three bagger. Today a bag is also a condom, so now a three bagger can be a chick that's really hot. So hot you gotta put several condoms on to dull the senses.
That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.
Nearly four.
I get crazy dreams and I black out.
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
My shrink says he's not so bad.
Every woman at some point has to date a musician. I wish you'd get rid of Mark for good. Every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out.
People notice you Frida.
Maybe he's just shy.
Sorry. It's just so bad lately. You're so lucky you never get PMS.
Can't you get contacts?
Frida, grab that red one.
What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom."
I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out.
No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.
Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
Tuesday. Are you okay?
Shit, I guess I missed work.
Relax. Carlton was torn apart. No way could you have done that. Maybe you saw someone kill him and blocked it out... or...
I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
You should have seen it erect.
Does that mean this whole thing is over?
The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
So what do I do?
About Mark? Carlton?
Starving.
That's great. Highly original.
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
Oh come on. Knock it off.
Frida, you know you're it for me.
It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
My bra is my biggest supporter.
On your desk.
Are you following me?
What are they for?
Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
Is that how you feel?
You didn't say it.
I loaned him to Jennifer. George moved out and she was lonely...
They do? Oh no...
What? Is there someone else?
I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.
What about... those guys... I might have...
Thanks.
Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
He's been running money for the Mafia.
Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?
You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk.
Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.
No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.
She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
Madonna's in Penthouse?
One of our only leads... You had dates with both men right before they were killed.
Only two bucks.  Shave as well...
Jesus.  Small world.  Where's the photographer?
No one available.
Actually, I was wondering, sir, if you could let me have a few uniforms, to follow up for me...
I didnít requisition a secretary.
<u>Fine</u>?  Look here!
Don't know that either.
What?  Who has?
No.  Have a look.
Yes.
Where does it lead?
Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are insignificant.
Then we must call the police.
You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.
That's what people keep telling me.
I told you, I can't remember a thing!
I'm nothing then.
Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is short.  Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
No it isn't.  <u>You</u> are doing it!  Now raise it over the glass and...
Uh -- I don't know.   Sometimes it's just like a barter thing...  Is this legal?
We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.
Alan
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
Share...
Yeah.
Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
... What?
What do you mean, he's clean?
Clean.
Check his kids.
You think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months!
Oh.  Excuse me.
It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
Couple of days.  Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
I'll lock him away for good.
I was gonna do something with Joan.
That'd be great.
Look, I'm sorry.  I know you said not to talk, but when I saw the crowd I just got excited...
Extend things?
I'm not sure... I might have.
At a press conference.
Dave...
Alan...
Oh, I know, I know... It looks awfully bad.  It's really embarrassing.  But it was Bob's idea.
He's not.
And it's proving quite effective...
What about it?
First thing they teach you at the academy.  `Don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King.'
Oh... right...  You know, ever since the stroke...
Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
Where are you going?
Home.
Truman used it all the time.
) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?
It's nice.
Fabulous.
To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...
Oh, yes. Quiet. Yes. We must be quiet.
THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS...
Gasparilla?
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
Farther than you think. You'll get lost. You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie.
What?
Forever, darlin'. Forever. 'Til he turns ta dust and blows away on the wind.
Look...I know you have no reason to trust me. I've got friends in the Cave. I got some stuff comin' out this mornin'. I'm gonna try to get off the island.
We got a boat.
I got some fuel comin' out and, I hope, some automatic rifles.
You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done.
No. You won't be able to do it. He will rise. He will rise and you... you will die.
Leave me alone, you...COCKSUCKER!!!
I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need...
Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
Hell no, I'm not afraid of them just, if we get caught with them, we're dead.
Come on.  It'll help you get Chris.
Women swoon!
And English, and trig
I'm not?
Yes... sir.
No.
Stop what?
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
Chet won't know anything.  We'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
Carpe Diem... seize the day.
Courtyard?
A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
Then you can help him.
When you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please.  Until then, you will listen to me.
Yes sir.
Beyond the stream.  I think I know.
My brother went here.
I don't.
Thanks but  I'd better do history.
God, you really have a problem, don't you?  How can it hurt you to read?  I mean isn't that what this is all about? Expressing yourself?
So I'm gonna act!  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
Jesus Christ, whose side are you on?  I haven't even gotten the part yet.  Can't I enjoy the idea even for a little while?
Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you.  When you say things, people pay attention.  People follow you.  I'm not like that.
Neil, you're not gonna...
Lots of girls.  The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
Put more into it!
Boat or no boat...I'm going...
He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.
That's where my boat's moored.
You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
What are those things?
Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
Right... You have a boat.
The quiet...
You should talk...
What?
Right...
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
...we gotta get outta here -- NOW.
Shut up, man, just shut the hell up! I gotta think! I gotta think!!
If I don't, I ain't going back to get it...you think we're safe?
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
Seafood salad.  You ever operate a jet ski?
You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN...or like made up countires too?
Nothing.
What happened to Vivo?! What the hell happened to Vivo?
She fucked me too.
Gimme a Hostess Twinkie, Merle.
Get the boots.
Fuckin' A!
Who's going?
You're full of shit!
They did too!
I know! I fuckin' know!
Yeah.
But I insist.
Merle is under his tree... Beside the terrace. You can't miss him.
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
You mean...?
Get anything?
No.
Too bad.
Naw.
Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more... He retired, you know.
Shhh! Albert's gonna hump the Coup de Ville.
Vince!!!
Nick, she won't say why.
Biederman, yes.
Linda... Hey, Linda...
I made you a sweater.  Here... You have to take that off.
Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from.
Naw, it's... This guy wants his money.
Nick. It's okay... It's okay.  I have to go now.
I see you're going hunting.
I... No. You do this for money?
Right here.
I know.
Huh?
I just wait. For this... It's what I wait for... I wait all year.
Yeah.
Yeah... I guess.
You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac!
Pow.
Merle --
Tomorrow I go with Vince.
What are you, hoping?
Nick, you're wasting your time... Listen to me! You're wasting your time! This is no fucking time for hoping or praying or wishing or any other shit! This is it. Here we are... And we gotta get out!
We what?
Merle... Hey, Merle, listen...  Why?
No.
No!!!?
No.
Place is great. Really. One great place... Basketball, bowling. You name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of guys are making salad bowls. What I'll do is make a salad bowl for you, unless you'd rather have a pencil holder. The pencil holder's neat, I mean --
You didn't get a deer?
Phantom Mary?
I mean, I guess you still think about Nam. Right? I mean --
Sure.
In the timeless words of Squire Albert...
Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
I'd think about it.
You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
Out of the room.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
Not anymore.
I heard about today.  Good job.  I'm all for capital punishment.  Why don't you go home and see your family?
You're crazy.
How do I look?
You sure?  I can help you.
Commissioner Gallagher gave me specific orders not to let you drive until you re-familiarize yourself with the process and territory.
But Sergeant...
When you're frozen, you're legally dead, right?
I also PVC'd you.  Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs.  Four honor medals...
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
Nothing makes sense when you're a cop.
This is where I found Doucet twenty years ago.  Thought maybe he'd come back.
No, sir.
Not too good.
What's it mean?
You never want to find out.
You could always take it off.
Oh --  Didn't mean to talk like that in front of a lady.  Get some wine for the Squire, Belle.
Guess there will, if it says so.
It does hurt! And don't you do it again.
Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself.
You're wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that. Well, I hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown. You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair, to be sure. But if we'd had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains.
Daniel! ...  I've stood just about as much as I can bear!
Daniel! ... You must go to sleep.
Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?
Sure am.
What Grange?
That farmers' association -- we were talking about the other day.
We'll be mighty glad to have you with us.
Belle.
-- in gold.
Some other time, Stevens.
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years.  It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.
Well, why should that worry you. A soul -- a soul is nothing. Can you see it, smell it, touch it? -- No! -- Think of it -- this soul -- your soul -- a nothing, against seven whole years of good luck! You will have money and all that money can buy. Upon my word, Neighbor Stone, if it weren't for my firm's reputation for generous dealing--
Look here now--
Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --
Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose.
You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?
There's no joy in it for me.
I know -- that was mighty queer Medford -- knew it the minute I tasted it. But it takes more than that to down Daniel Webster.
Well? Don't a politician have to be?
Yes.
That's what we said.
If the pig hadn't broke his leg, we could have taken him.
Mary -- what would you do?
Mary -- you just wait and see -- It's all -- just the beginning -- just the beginning -- of everything. I'll be the biggest man in New Hampshire and you'll be the wife of the biggest man.
Don't take cold, Jabez.  Come -- it's warm in here.
Hello, Jabez --  Here's your son.
I am going to lock him up.
You're not supposed to punish my son, Mary.
Oh, for heaven's sake, leave me alone!
That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet. A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say, didn't he, Ma?
Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
That's a word you're too free with lately, Jabez, consarn this and consarn that ...
A man can always change things, Son. That's what makes him different from barnyard critters.
And I say she won't! I'll not have the scorn of God on this place -- with the smell of fish in it, polluting up the Sabbath!  And as for you -- let me tell you, young woman...!
Mary -- Jabez --
Land sakes, I don't mind. I never did hold much with Job, even if he is Scripture. He took on too much to suit me. I don't want to malign the man, but he always sounded to me as if he came from Massachusetts. Yes, Mary, you go ahead and read.
Yes, Jabez -- don't worry.
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
What mountain?
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that.
I've heard some odd things about Jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.
And now come on, Mary. I want to show you the all-fired biggest parsnips in the whole United States, raised right here in Marshfield -- of course!
Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.
I can't be honest with them.
That's okay.  This is my first time riding in one.
But meant her moving here.
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
Tell that to Mr. Takagi.
I told them we're old friends and you were my guest at the party.
What does he want?
I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
I'm afraid not.  But you have me at a loss -- you know my name, but who are you?  Just another American who saw too many movies as a child.  Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne...Rambo... Marshal Dillion.
One weekend I went to a combat ranch...  You know, that game with the, the guns that shoot red paint?  Must sound pretty silly to you...
Sounds better than nothing.
* Well have a look at what our friends outside are doing and I'll be right up.
Oh?  What idiot put you in charge?
No.  But I'll have a sofa brought out to you.  Good enough?
Sure.  Follow me.
Oh...Where does he live?
No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?
Holly Gennero?
I've seen enough phoney ID's in my time to recognize that the ones they've got cost a fortune.  Add all that up and I don't know what the fuck it means, but these are bad ass preps and they're here to stay.
No, but it's gonna need one hell of a paint job and a shitload of screen doors.  One spotters say you got two with that blast.
You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
Not yet, the wife in working on our first.  You got any kids back on the ranch?
Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours?  That doesn't even make any sense --
Yeah.  But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
I still feel like shit.
I'm serious.  Hey, this is my wife... Holly Gennero.
We don't exactly know, Sir.  He won't give us him name.  He appears to be the man who called in the report...he's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others.
I don't think so, Sir.  In fact... I think he's a cop.  Maybe not LAPD, but definitely a badge.
Going in...are you out of your mind? There's 30 hostages in there -- for all we know --
-- all we know?  We don't know shit, Powell.  If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom?  If there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands?  All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio!
Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene?
I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out.
What if we gotta kill a whole lot of people?
Listen.
Come on, what's under this?
Yes, I would.
Heidi, I'm dying.
Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up! Will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?!
It's too late - just get away from me - don't talk to me now - go over to your place...
I love you.
That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
So... that sure is something.
I don't know what I'm doing.
I gotta listen to it if they think...
That's great.  Just terrific.  You talk to me with them on the phone, right?  That is really smart.  And, you don't tell me?
I don't know what to say to him.  I can't.
I told you -- keep away.  I don't know what we do now.
Okay, give us the women.
So -- you want me to send one out there ... Okay.  I'll see what I can do.
I don't know, Sonny.  I don't know if the helicopters can land in here. I'll have to check it out.  I got superiors, unnerstan?  They don't always see eye to eye with me. I'll do what I can.
Nothin' doin'.  I give you one hostage when you bring my wife, and one for the helicopter, one for the jet, and the rest can come home on the jet.
It can't happen again ... I'll do everything I can to stop anything I can ...
You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ...
Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
He's totally unstable.  He'll make a mistake.
He hasn't so far.  I'm the one who can make a mistake.  That's what scares the shit out of me.
Do what the gentleman says, Howard.
It's locked on the inside.  It's through that passageway and to the right.
I got two kids ... and I'd like to see them again.
What are you talking about?  What do you think I'm doin'?  I'm gettin' the ball rollin'.  I'm keeping these people happy ... I'm keeping you happy ... I gotta keep the cops cooled out ... I gotta do everything ... I gotta pay for the pizza ... I'm workin' on it, do you know what I mean?  I'm workin' on it ... Jesus Christ!  I gotta do it all ... I got all the ideas ... you want me to give you the gun?  You want to take it over?
I'm not going.  I'm okay.
I stay here.  Damn it.  I just needed the insulin.  I'm used to it. Go on.  Go on.
You tell me.  Is he endangering his health, because if you tell me he is, I'll get him out.
Oh, Jesus!  You want to be a martyr or a hero or what?
Would I hire you?
Listen, I owe a couple hundred dollars!  I don't wanta leave owing anybody anything!  A clean slate, a new leaf...
Girls, I wanta apologize.  For my language back there.
Yeah.
Pure?
For God's sake!  As soon as I'm outta this bank robbery, I'm gonna stop ... okay?
You're really pure, you know?  You got a perfect record.  You never used that stuff to ruin your body, why start now?
You know, you remind me of my 19- year-old brother - only he's got his hair down to his knees - he looks like something that eats berries and roots out of the ground. God forbid I should say something to him like, 'Listen, if you ever smoke marijuana, just remember that it's illegal' and he storms outta the house.  You rob a bank, but you keep your body pure, is that it?
Fuck him - let him out!
Get 'em in the vault!
We won't have to.
Wyoming.
Wyoming ... That's not out of the country -- that's in the United States ... Look, I'll be back.
It's nothing - it just goes up - it's the safest thing in the world. Safer than a car.  Don't worry about it, Sal - it'll be all right ... they're great ...
All right. 
Okay, when do I get them?
I have to see.
What I said.  You just sit quiet and we'll handle Sal.
You can't allow!  I'm running this thing, what gives you the idea you can say shit?  Come on.  I'll pay you.  Whatta you want?  Two hundred?  A thousand?
Okay.  Which one goes?
Sonny - Here's your document.
What's wrong with that?  The FBI was very understanding when I explained it to him.  Everybody knows it isn't you ... It's the pressures from your home life.
He's right.  You shoulda done what he did.  Go home.  Don't talk to the FBI anymore.
What about, ah, non-union occupations?
You're news, Sonny ...
I don't want to be paid.  I'm here with Sal and eight other people ... and we're dyin'!  They're gonna blow our guts out, man!  You're gonna see our brains onna sidewalk! How's that for all you shut-ins and housewives to look at!  You gonna help, or you just put it on instead of AS THE WORLD TURNS?  We're dyin' here!  What have you got for me?

On a raid. If she wants to see justice... we gonna take Domino to the Jungle, baby. <b> EXT. JUNGLE -- NEXT </b> The El Camino pulls into the entrance to the JUNGLE.

You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.

Where the fuck do you think you're going?

No. What's the big deal?

Is that the only tape you got?
I like 'em, but you don't play anything else.
Who told you to buy a brownstone on my block, in my neighborhood on my side of the street?
I'm under the assumption that this is a free country and one can live where he pleases.
Did you ask Sal?
What was you saying?
I don't know how he does it.
Yes indeed.  You almost got yourself killed last night.
I've done that before.
Wake up!
Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
I'm working.
I'm going with you.
Nice!
I didn't stutter.  You heard me.
Do I have to spell it out?
Talk to your son.
Depends.
Sal, just do me a favor, leave Jade alone.
No, just checking.
I'm not guilty of nuthin'.
You only pay me two-fifty a week.  I owe you fifty bucks.
I can dig it.  It's gonna be HOT as a motherfucker.
Gotta go.
I work too, but I still make time.
Tina, what do you want me to do?
Do I love you?
What took you so long?  Is it hot?
Come in then.
I've been working hard, getting paid.
Why you gotta curse?
To get my money.
Remember what I said.
I didn't know you could read.
Keep dreaming.
I love you, Black.
Sez me.
I'm listening.
I know.
That's gonna be the last time you hit Vito.
Mister Radio Raheem, I can't even hear myself think.  You are disturbing me and you are disturbing my customers.
Yeah, you are. He touched you. You're "it" until you touch someone else.
I have five kids at home, I know how it works. I'm just not "it". Okay guys? Two fifty.
... flying gracefully... over the rice fields.
Excuse me.
Four colors? Neato!
HARRY Dunne.
MS. HELLER said not to talk to you.
Yeah. Look at this polar bear. It hasn't moved in half an hour. And those Eskimos over there...I'm sure at least one of them is a mannequin.
Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special
Gotcha.
She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.
I'm just not ready.
Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie!
So boys, how was your first day?
Me too!
Cool.
My mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
Don't we want them to talk to us?
Shift to your left.
Can we eat there tomorrow?
The second R is silent.
Sounds like a pirate.
You take that back!
I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
Kids.
HARRY, I said don't 'dress like a Queen'!
How do you know it's for us?
Who's your partner?
Alright, if you really want to go down this road, well girl's like chocolate.
I kinda screwed things up.
Yes.
I bet you want your head scratched.
Captain Rob came back?
You wouldn't get it. Just a private joke between best friends.
The answer is George Jefferson.
A blimp.
Who?
You thinking what I'm thinking?
It was a diamond and you swallowed it.
Do you know what this means?
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
That's what Jessica was talking about!
Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!
Try one in a million!
Nevertheless, you could have mentioned the sauce.  Well, I see you have a camera.
I wouldn't know. Being that I'm just the teacher and all.
Don't play with me dear, you're way out of your league.
And, Ching Chong, you're not a Special Needs kid. You're just a foreign exchange student.
HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something.
Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.
Uh-oh. Harry?
I liked it a lot.
Hey can be on top?
Have you got what I want?
Class, please study on your own. There seems to be a family emergency because there's no other reason why my father would interrupt me WHILE I'M WORKING!
Collins can be a pretty crafty guy, what do I do if he smells the trap.
I don't think he'll smell anything - just make sure he takes the check. I've been through this a hundred times.
Well you know Detective, he's expecting  'Moffit' to be someone who has... certain... well...
And I you.
Yes, it's the big potato. Just have a look at this.
Oh wow. Look at you.
No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.
Just like the President.
No... no it's not horse, you see I sold the horse.
The carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester. Try and get in close over the harvester... you'll find this interesting Sire. -- The Duke accelerates the ornithopter in the direction of the harvester. Paul can SEE...
LISTEN TO ME!! The spice must flow... the spice has given me accelerated evolution for four thousand years... it has enabled you to live two hundred years... the spice helps make the sapho juice, which gives the red-lipped mentats the ability to be living computers... the secret side of spice... the water of life.
Play out your little comedy while you can off-worlders...

I will take the boy-man... he shall have sanctuary in my tribe... -- A LOW NOTE on a dip stick is blown by one of the Fremen tribe.  Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon, Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat. Paul moves on her first move.  He races up a rocky incline.
That's it! The Missionaria Protectiva has been here planting protective legends against a day of Bene Gesserit need. And that day has come. I must play out this sham.  I know the Dark things and the way of the Great Mother. Miseces prejin.
What does she fear?  What about my Father?
I know the secret.  The worm is the spice... the spice is the worm.
Bless the Maker and his water... Bless the coming and going of him.  May his passage cleanse the world.
SILENCE... SILENCE.
Where?
It is my home.
Oh, tract housing, huh?  I guess I shouldn't complain about my duplex in Burbank.  What a dump. Some places have a Murphy bed, this place has a Murphy <u>shower</u>.  I still don't know where to hang the towels!
Yes.  I'm embarking on another bus- andótruck tour of "Dracula." Twelve cities in ten days, if that's conceivable.
Do you want me to get it for you?
Of course!  Well, we got a big day planned for you... First, we're gonna start off a little easy, with you in that armchair over there.  Then, once you're up to speed and cooking, we'll reset and bring out the laboratory equipment --
Who do I play?
Of course!
No hospital.  Just take me to the couch...
We didn't make a dime.
Stop worrying.  This is going to raise your spirits.
Huh?
That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
Fine.  Let them!  There is no such thing as bad press.  A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page!  First celebrity to ever check into rehab.  When I get out of here, I will be healthy.  Strong!  I will be primed for my comeback!
Uh... you're a very important and respected man.  You're leaving your house... and you're in a hurry to a big social event.
That's great.  Let's do a take.
Eddie, how was I?
I dunno.  Lie on the beach?
If you say so.
Sound!
I mean I can't see the difference. I'm color-blind.  But I like the dark gray one.
Nothin'!  I told him he was great.
I don't understand.
It's that easy?
Will he be okay?
The ghost can be barefoot.  <u>Give</u> <u>me your shoes</u>!
I know... But sometimes I get scared this is as good as it's gonna get...
Aw, er, it's just a bunch of hot air. I had to say something to get in the door.
Yeah!  I met a movie star!  Somebody <u>really big</u>!
Close!  The <u>other</u> one!
Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
Say it a little louder.  I don't think Bela heard you in his trailer.
Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.
Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going...  But <u>of course</u> I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.
Don't get angry at me.  Maybe you just need a day job.
I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?
That's right...
Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
I don't know.  Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?
Ah!  Atomic Age stuff, huh?  I like it.  I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward.  Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus.  Maybe we can do business together.
Yes?
We are gonna finish this film <u>just</u> <u>the way I want it</u>!  Because you can't compromise an artist's vision!
Da pleasure be mine.
Tor!
Nah, that doesn't matter!  It's a visual medium.
Hopefully, very soon.  I'm just awaiting the final okay from Mr. Feldman at MGM.
Don't worry.  You just haven't met right woman yet.  Oopsy.  That cabbage goes right through me.
And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even <u>matter</u> if they're right for the part!
Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
No, of COURSE I'm gonna make the movie!  I've already preósold Alabama and Oklahoma.  Those repressed Okies really go for that twisted pervert stuff.  So we'll just make it without that she-male.  We'll fictitionalize it.
No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
Yeah!  Five pages right before it ends!  The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.
And what's with this new title?!  My poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"!
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
Good.  And one more thing.  I think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.
How long's he been here?
I am.  How's your father?
I just picked them up on the way over...
I was a fuckin' HACK!  I let people recut the movies, cast their relatives...  I let Bela down...
Let's get married.
Yes?
No!  I don't want you to show the movie, I want you to be <u>in it</u>!  See, maybe I should explain: We started shooting, but then after three days we got shut down.  So we're having a backers party, to raise some more money.  Perhaps you'd like to come next door and meet some of the backers...?
Look buddy, I'm a big star.  I've got real offers from real studios.  I don't need to blow some dentist for a part.  So forget it!
You know, to make the legs move --
I'm directing.
No, I work in pictures.  I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.
Who?
ME?!  No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.
At the point -- I don't -- Look you'd be on TV maybe one or two times each. I'11 try to avoid I'11 go out of my way to avoid, getting together with you. Believe me.
Who?
They celebrated the common person.
Okay, I'm nuts.
Leave her be.
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
According to your mother. When the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that --
Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --
Mm.
Hank! All of a sudden. Because now you're famous and he can get something from you. I don't wan you to become a victim like Marcia.  Not that you're a victim, honey. You're not. Life's just been a little hard on you, sweetie.
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
Oh God. What hospital?
I'm coming right over. I'll be right there.
I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!
No, I understand. That's - where is she, is she all right?
Shari, Ray feels --
She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself.
She wouldn't tell me.
They're gonna mock our foibles.
Cream rinse?
All right. Okay. I'11 ... see you.
Really?
Weird? If this happened last month it would've been weird. Now with... the TV and... now it's just too weird.
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
What?
I know, I ...
I really like you too...
Everybody hates me!
Ohh...
Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care.  Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other... 
So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.
...yeah?
Where were you?
I know. I mean I'm sitting there and her father's asking me about my "career prospects" and I'm playing "Risk," with her kid brother, Leon and at dinner the dog's sniffing at my balls -- at least I hope it was the dog. 'Cause her mother disappeared for a while.
Screw off.
How many opportunities are you going to get in your life?
See, they should've picked him. Look how comfortable he is out there.
What's the dif --
"Quick pull off the highway" is not a relationship. Oh man, I gotta pee.
Great.
While I'm gone, tell them about our cousin Lenny who's gay. We knew from when he was five.
Me?! That's you!
Hi, Shari.
No. Am I supposed to?
No. Two times.
What...
Thanks... That's ...
We have to stop meeting like this.
Ohh... do you own a cat?
Everyone has foibles. Then the whole country sees them on TV and mocks them. Then we have... mocked foibles.
Foxy. . . Foxy. . . You know you're a cute little heartbreaker... Foxy... You know you're a sweet little love maker...
He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him.
Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.
Yeah, just --
What?
You're kidding, right?
Larry, we're not electing the fucking Pope here. Just tell me who won.
Huh.  Okay.  Well, I guess I'd better do my count.
I think we've got a problem.
See, it doesn't add up. There are only 801 ballots but 803 people voted. Two votes are missing. Check the register.
...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
Hey, that's super
You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.
well, I don't know.  It could have been anybody.  There are a lot of, you know, subversive elements around Millard.  You know, like Rick Thieson and Kevin Speck and those burn-outs.  Or Doug Schenken - what about him?  Or what about Tammy Metzier?  Her whole thing is being anti- this and anti-that.
I'm looking at new cars.
My house.
Take as much room as you want
Thanks. Well. I'm going home now.
Okay.  Give me the drill.
Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little.
All his life.  He's tried everything.
We'll let it run awhile
Easy, tiger.  Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
We made a mistake.  Let's not make it worse.
Me?  I took advantage of you?  You hugged me!  You kissed me!  You're the one who --
No, wait -- apples.  Apples.
What?
People can see this.
Okay, Mr. Popular.  You're on.
Yeah.
Thanks.  You too.  It was great working with you.
So Mr. M. calls me in and tells me --
What's it to you?
Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>.
It's practically stamped on your forehead.
How'd she meet Patchett?
He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
It's Bud.
I used to.  What I do now is strong-arm.  Sitting duck stuff... No, I don't like it.  If I could work Homicide like a real detective...
How'd you get to know so much about him?
So tell me about it.
Dudley, what do you want?
Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.
I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation.  That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely.  Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell. 
Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight.
Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.
Somebody got wind of it, killed them all.
They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
What about him?
If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all.
I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come?
What little studio?
There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.  I use girls who look like movie stars.  Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.
Of course... this is personal with you, isn't it, Mr. White?
<u>Ear plugs</u>.
It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
The public demands justice, sir. This was a full-fledged riot of policemen.  Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured.  Force them to retire.  But someone has to swing.  Indict, try and convict Stensland and Bud White.  Secure them jail time.  Feed them to the sharks, sir.  Protect yourself; protect the department.
Until he gunned down six people.
Nothing.
Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
Man, what're you saying?
Ray, we got the shotguns.
What does that have to do --
And what?
Answer yes or no.
I... No.
She may still be alive, whoever she is.
Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.
Not even with Exley?
I'm snitching three old timers who'll be fishing in Oregon next week.  Next to you I'm clean.  And smart.
What?
Just don't shoot me.
It's not a request.  I need to know what White knows.  Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.'  Permanently.
Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?
I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I can't hear your confession.
Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?
He said you were smart.  He also said you were competing with your dead father.  How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost.
Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.
I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  There's more if you want to hear it.
You, me and White, huh?
I know how he feels.
Some men get the world.  Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.
What's Dudley's scheme?
He's queer too.  Metro paid him two grand a week to fake it with ingenues.  On screen and off.  I'm getting him to fuck the D.A. for a hundred bucks.  That's twice the fifty you got for wrecking his career.
Give me some Narco skinny.  I want to put out an all hop-head issue. Shvartze jazz musicians and movie stars.  Maybe tie it into the Rosenbergs.  You like?
You didn't get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute.
He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
Brill's dead. He died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a Kansas field.  My name doesn't matter.
It started with the information you gave me on DePinto. After we talked, he agreed to resign. Next, a phony detective asked me about Daniel Zavitz. Then an investigator questioned me about an extortion scheme they claimed Zavitz was behind. The FBI started looking into mob connections. A doctored picture in the paper. Overnight, I'm ruined. Wife. job, bank accounts, everything gone.
Nothing.
Who are you calling?!
You're not.
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
Who else have you told?
Why?
One of many people who would live a word with you.
It's a SAT-tracker.
Why are they after <u>me</u>?
I don't know <u>anything</u>.
No shit.
What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
I'll pay you.
In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building.
'Kay, well, could you walk faster, please.
They shouldn't have come without calling first.
Listen--
What if--
What if <u>what</u>?
Reynolds.
How fast can you learn?
Who's calling?
It's Pat Cary. I work for Senator Sam Albert and I was given Jerry's name.
Are you sure about this?
I'm married to my wife...of several years...and I'd like to buy...as a Christmas present...
Yes. I have her permission.
Very good.
I don't know anything about this. Well, I mean, I know a <u>little</u> about--from a certain perspective. My point is, I don't want to do anything foolish.
Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.
Daniel's life is already ruined. Maybe if you guys stopped thinking about yourselves for a change and--
What kind of trouble.
You tell me.
Are you invoking attorney/client privilege.
For your wife?
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
Not a very good one, but--
A toaster. And no terrorist talk at dinner. You're spookin' the kids.
What do you mean?
Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
Robert--
"At the center of the investigation are well-known Washington-area attorneys Robert Dean and Rachel Banks."
You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.
Stacy--
Was that doctored-up, too?
I know.
Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me. Now goddamit--
It's over.
Albert's gonna get me my job back.
You did good.
I want to talk to a goddam lawyer.
You didn't squeeze DePinto?
I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same.
Never.
I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law.
This conversation's over.
What makes you think it's you?
We'd rather not--
--otherwise we may have to--
Fuck you. You may have to--
Shut the fuck up.
Gimme the shoe.
Forget me, forget what I did for you. Don't <u>ever</u> mention my name or try to contact me again. Get it?
I have to go lingerie shopping.
Well until we find, you're gonna have to take a leave of absence.
Mr. Dean--
Dad!
She's in the kitchen.
No. We're never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens sometimes.
You've got a bunch of Armani suits, they didn't take 'em?
Usually they take clothes.
What about jewelry?
You're tired.
I won't <u>make</u> it to the police. They won't let me get there. You go.
I have a family.
Yeah?
Go fuck yourself.
It's been a few years.
How can I reach you?
The police?
No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?
You remember Daniel Zavitz?
Why not?
Because we, and our associates, have paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars to shyster lawyers like you, <u>because</u> of shyster lawyers like you, and we'd just as soon sit back and sip a beer while you get ass-banged by as many people as possible.
He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
We found the originals.
The originals?
Am I to understand--
He never made it to the newspaper, but there was private sector contact.
Several indiscriminates and one primary who we've ID'd as Robert Dean. A Crystal City attorney.  Mr. Reynolds?  Sir?
He had help.
No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside Greenland.
We believe?
Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
Lyle?!
The door was open, sir. I just need a signature.
This guy's carrying the <u>flag</u> for the damn terrorism bill. You think this is the best time to piss him off?
That insults them.
Excuse me.
After the market, you followed me to the hotel.
I thought you might paste them into your book.
See what's happening to them - the stars.
I believe you still have my book.
Now.
What do you hate most?
Ownership.  Being owned.  When you leave, you should forget me.
What?  No!
Arabic?
This is a different world - is what I tell myself.  A different life. And here I am a different wife.
Do you think you're the only one who feels anything?  Is that what you think?
It hurts too much.
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
Could I trouble you for some water?
No!  NO!  Don't radio anybody, just give me the fucking jeep!
What did you do?
Bermann!
What's the matter with you?
Tomorrow afternoon.  Don't worry. I'll be ready.
Shut-up!
Fritz?  What are you talking about? Who's Fritz?
It's impossible.  I was buying or selling something.  I've been to Cairo many times.
Or was it Toronto?
No.
Rabbit hunting.
I think that's called looting.
No-one should own music.  The real question is who wrote the song?
Finally!  So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
There are going to be trials, they want me to interpret, don't they know I'm allergic to courtrooms?
But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?
I'm not pregnant.  I'm hot.  I'm too hot.
Marzipan!  I think you've got marzipan in your hair.  No wonder you're homesick.
Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.
I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.
I can see my wife in that view.
Are you crazy?
Because I'm a nurse.
Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.
Really?  That's sudden.
My mother always told me I would summon my husband by playing the piano.
You'd better be.
That was a dance we invented at the International Sand Club.
No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.
There's a mine here, but the others are far enough away, I think at least to give me a chance.  I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over.
I follow the wires.
You must get away.  Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.
It's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean literally.
And what if he really is a spy?
Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others -
Only we have to go to work.
I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
This is making me incredibly angry.
A more modest expedition, or even wait a year.  Remind our families we still exist.
It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives.
No.  I think I was a pilot.  I was found near the wreckage of a plane by the Bedouin.  I was with them for some time.
You tell me.  I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France.
I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
I don't recall asking your permission.
Through a window.
Give me a break. Remember Manzini? When he stole Montezuma's scepter he left a Pepto Bismal bottle. The best ones always copy Mac.
We're getting close.
I can't?
It's nothing serious. I'll just run into that building. They'll have some sort of first aid kit.
Excuse me?
Oh, that's quite all right. No charge.
Maybe I should drive this time.
Not a word.
I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
And--
Hmmm. I'd be surprised if you could.
My job, my rules. We've got a job to do. No mixing business and pleasure.
Nice spot.
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
You need a partner for this job. You'll never find one as good as me.
It's not a village. There's nothing there.
I've got something for you.
How in the devil did you do the Rembrandt then?
Yes. Yes.
A billion dollars.
I always knew you'd do the job.
There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
Where the money is.
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.
Look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. You've done that a dozen times.
Packed.
Hong Kong midnight, happy new year. Except at China Bank.
It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.
Because it pays off.
Check out my ball.
It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.
To yourself, that's where.
We wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces, you know? And they don't come off. But when you find the one person who really knows you, and then you lose her...
Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.
That's a joke, right?
Don't use language with me --
What about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors.
He's a low-life.  Speaking of which, that's your nine o'clock in there.
You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...
Yeah?  I should learn to do stuff like that. They make the place feel real homey.
It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
Yeah.
Well, I was gonna head over to the Browns now.  I was thinking -- Mandy really values your opinion ...
Both.
Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God damn, he made me look like some cheap --
I told you the questions might get a little personal --
Oh.  Okay.  That's okay.
I guess I'm not the right kind.
I left a message.  I've been dealing with that real estate thing.  I was gonna write up a whole damn report and --
I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
Well, that was nice of him.  Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax?
So what made you think it was?
Look, Erin, this is not the way I do business, this extortion nonsense.
A ten percent raise and benefits.  But that's it.  I'm drawing the line.
I don't remember seeing any ponds up there.
And that's what caused the contamination?
It didn't help, but no.  The real problem's on the bottom.
What do you mean?
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
Reasons PG&E thinks it shouldn't go to --
Bullshit.  It was a misunderstanding.  But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect --
Okay, look.  It's an important meeting. Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --
And, what, I'm not serious?
With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.
Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
Here what comes?
I wasn't gonna --
Ross -- you are an absolute angel.
There's more than one kind?
Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.
With repeated exposure to toxic levels -- God, anything, really -- respiratory disease, liver failure, heart failure, reproductive failure, chronic headaches, bone or organ deterioration -- plus, of course, any type of cancer.
Yeah, we had them couriered over.  And listen, good work.  They're a great start. We're just going to have to spend a little time filling in the holes in your research.
Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs.
I do.
I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to.
Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.
Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.
If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so.
Just a few more minutes, then we can go.  Take her, will you?
I can't.  Look -- this job -- it's the best thing that ever happened to me.  I mean it. For the first time in my life, I got people respecting me.  Up in Hinkley, I walk into a room and everyone shuts up just to hear what I got to say.  I never had that.  Ever. Don't ask me to give it up.  I need it.
Real early.  We're just gonna take your car to get some breakfast.
I'm real sorry, Laura.
Uh-huh?
Outside with the sprinkler.  So it's good?
My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me.  I'm going to move in with her.
You're moving away?  When?
Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to this?
This one I have watched a long time.  All his life has he looked away ... to the horizon, to the sky, to the future.  Never his mind on where he was, on what he was doing.  Adventure, excitement ...  A Jedi craves not these things!
He's too old.  Yes.  Too old to start the training.
We've come this far ... He is our only hope.
No ... there is another.
I'm cold ... so cold ...
Howls.
No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.
We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
Fine.  But they'll have to take care of themselves.
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?
He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look.  Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me.  If I don't pay off Jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop ... Remotes, Gank killers, and who knows what else.  I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head.
Me?  I don't know what you mean.
Now you're making sense.
Would you please stop calling me that?
Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.
It's not my fault.  I can't under- stand it!
Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
You look great.
Me either.  They had me howling on the scan grid, but they never asked me any questions.
Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.
Hyperdrive.
Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.  They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.
He doesn't want you at all.  He's after someone named Skywalker.
Would you care to join me for a little refreshment?
You're part of the mining guild then?
This is no time to be choosy, honey.  What do you say we debate this later?  There's still a chance I can get you out of here.
What chance have we got in here? What are we going to do when they cut ...
His fate is sealed.  You'll be lucky to get out yourself.  All systems are on alert.  everything's locked.
Luke needs help.  We must go back.
It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando, open the hatch.
Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
First Han, now you.  When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...
Jabba the Hutt?
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
But I feel The Force flowing!
Yes ... I also feel danger ... death.  Something's not right.
This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force.  A servant of evil it is.  Into it you must go.
What's in there?
Difficult to see.  Always in motion is the future ... Back away, little machine!
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
Time will tell.
Good God.
They're...pretending to dress.
We know that.
Believe what?
I did not call her mad.  I merely asked her if she was.  And I repeat the question.  Are you mad?
There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.
With food?
I don't believe it.
He's a gorilla.
I like you.
Plissken, slow down the sub. You're overloading the power plant.
Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two armies. No one gets near him.
You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin' things up as you go along. That's why I cut out on you in Cleveland. You're just a bum like the rest of us.
Don't lie to me.
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
Dream on, blue eye.
And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
That's the deal.
I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken.
Call me Snake.
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
You're free, Plissken. But if you even so much as break wind on a country road I'll crush you like a bug.
All right. Anything for you, Snake.  Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones' place.
Right over there.
So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
A little bit. But pretty soon I'm gonna be dead. So are you, Snake.
Give me the prototype.
He heard Lady Guenevere's request and he said nothing. That is all.
...Perceval!
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
And a great heart it is. Sir Lancelot, you will be my champion.
Of Merlin?
Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives! He lives in our dreams now, in that dark and shadowy place that is as strong and real as this more solid one. He speaks to us from there.
Is this a dream? Tell me, Merlin!
So be it.
You freed it, son?
Not you, my husband?
I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice?
I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live.
Why?
Love demands it.
I will run.
--What issues from your lust will be mine. Swear it again.
You didn't ask!
To kill and be king, is that all?
How about Lankaster Merrin.
That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now.
Let's see whose around. In the meantime I'll call you as soon as I know.
In here!
Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
Maybe the circuit is busy?
Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!
Of course I didn't.
Storage.
It's serious?
We still don't know.
Watch out for drafts. A draft in the fall when the house is hot is a magic carpet for bacteria.
Never mind.
No thanks Karl.
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
Oh no. I'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. Wait two or three weeks.
Lies?
Well, you see, that's quite similar to things like her lying- uncharacter-
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
Pretty close?
Didn't tell you of what she did?
That depends.
You wouldn't.
I beg your pardon?
If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?
No, you don't understand. Your daughter-
Like what?
It's not important good night.
I found it.
Where?
Here I'll show you.
No you don't. I do it all the time.
You think?
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
Well you know it's okay.
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.
Well your thinking's not so good.
That's good.
That's an insult, I got a vow of poverty.
I believe you.
Ah, that's good. That's all that's important. Back to business. Back to work. Bye now, Father.
I'm not Regan.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
Intensely.
Uoy era ohw.
Don't listen.
No we haven't met, but they said I could tell; that you looked like a boxer.
Only what I read in the papers.
And Dennings, you read how he died?
Yeah, a fall.
No I probably wouldn't.
I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K though, she gets tired and never likes to go.
...from this creature of God!!!
You killed your mother!!! You left her alone to die!!!! She'll never forgive you!!! Bastard!!!
Yes?
You're not going to drive!
Maybe next time.
No bones?
Recognize these two characters?
Wednesday next. Frank looks across the room at Jack.
How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?
You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack.
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
Of course, back then, things were a little different.  I was eight, Jack was seven, just about the only song we knew was 'My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean', and the only one who would listen to us was the family cat, Cecil.  We must have shaved three lives off that cat, eh, Jack?
Fuck him.  Great.  Terrific.  Fuck him.
It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little one ...
Cindy.
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
Seeing anyone in particular?
What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
Funny.  Strike a bell?
You'll see.
Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
Yeah, okay.
It wasn't like that.
If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
I thought maybe twenty percent. Look, with the additional bookings we'll come out ahead.  The big hotels, they want a pretty girl with a big voice. We have to stay competitive, Jack.
She'll get here.
Here, how's this?
You recognized me.
All right, but if you change your mind, let me know.  I gotta go get Ma in the morning anyway.
Not true.  Besides, Jack's the romantic.
No, you take the right.
How dare you say you love me.
Yeah, well, she's our girl now.  I think we better keep an eye on her.  There's trouble there.  Hey, listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane. Married seventy-five years.  You believe that?
What?
I'll take the Mallory.
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
Yeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others. Donna said even Lloyd called the other day. Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh?
We're finished.
Uh ... Frank Baker.  This is my brother.
I sing now?
When we know.
We're a team.  We work together.
Changed?
A seven.
Nine.
Zip me up?
Maybe.  I'll call him.
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night.  Chills. Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.
They must've bought the same map we did.
I don't believe it.  You're a romantic, Frank.
That song.  I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick.
Uh, well ...
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
He doesn't bite.
Black.  Labrador.
He mentioned you had a girl for a while.  A singer.
Forget it.
Nothing personal --
So why's he do it?
In and out.
Yeah, well, I wish God would go a little easy on the trumpets.
Practice.  There are worse songs, you know. Not many, but a few.
What's that supposed to mean?
Friend?  What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
Sure.
How come you didn't close your eyes?
Yeah, they got a convention for everything. At least he was clean.  Boy, the guys I met when I was with the service, you wouldn't believe.  The older ones, they were okay.  Nice.  Polite.  Pulled the chair out for you.  But the younger ones ...  Mama used to say, dance with a man once, but if you can feel calluses on his fingers, don't dance with him again.  She thought she had it all figured out. But she wasn't so smart.  There are killers with palms like a baby.
You sending me home?
He calls her, asks her to marry him, she thinks he's crazy, he asks her again, she still thinks he's crazy but says yes anyway, and the next thing you know he's got his brothers down there and they're tearing the thing right off the curb.
Terrific.  I'm doing vegetables next week.
What happened to the donut king?
How do you know?
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
Oh?
Eighty proof. What d'ya say? Think you can handle it?
That's what I want to do. I want to make a snowman.
You look great, Castor. Really.  Here -- I got a shot of your favorite -- Mescal.  Even has the worm.
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
You mean if I get sick?
... Thanks.
I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
Of course he is ...  -- He's yours too.
Yes.  Pollux bought one along with the original batch.  Obviously, he found a way to make more.
Must've been after we got engaged.
I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
Never mind that!  Just take Jamie and get out of that house.  Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.
I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
What more proof do you need?
Eve ...
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
Not anymore.
So's a noose.  Now keep your mouth SHUT.
You'll be seeing a lot of changes around here. Daddy's a new man.
It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!
Don't worry, nobody knows I'm inside.  Check it out.  Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand?  He's being treated for bone cancer at the V.A.  Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid-technology ...  -- Ooops!  His radiation does just quadrupled.
There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN.
Okay, then.  I leave it in your able hands.
Don't I usually kiss my wife?
They say love is blind. Do you think that's true?
So you see, I'm not going anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs with you ...
Great.
She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
She's probably just having a fit of nostalgia.  You know, lonely Christmas Eve, call the one that got away, that kind of thing.
I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why?
Is this another one of those Sun Tzu “Art of War” tricks?
I’m not worried, Mom. He’s still learning our ways...
Where’s my real dad?
You know how to make chocolate milk?
Mom liked it.
No, honey. Go back to sleep.
She is relentless.
Pretty much.
It wouldn’t really be cheating...  It’s complicated.
Yes...Jack Campbell...
Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise it’ll be returned!
A lucky streak, huh?
You just said everyone needs something.
Basically, it’s my car now.  Get in.
What the hell is happening to me?!
How much time?!
Look, I just want my life back.  Now what’s it gonna take?  You wanna talk turkey?  Let’s talk turkey!  How much money...?
Look Jack, in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it...let it come to you.
Get out!
Look, I don’t know what’s going on here but I am Senior Vice President of this company.
No, I didn’t...that’s great.
Well, I’m just a little confused right now about why I work here...
You’re having a bad day, I’ll go with you...actually, there’s no way in hell you’re gettin’ me back out there...
Well that’s just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful...
Look at me like you haven’t seen me every day for the last twelve years...
Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you...  ...who knows what would’ve happened if you hadn’t stepped in at the store.
Zeena...
I think it may help us but there’s a slight chance it could make things worse.
I already told you you were gonna get lucky, Jack...
Don’t worry about it, Jack...
Paris?
Don’t get on that plane!
We have two kids, Annie and Josh...
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
Okay, I’ll take them...
You won’t regret it...  Tommy!  Set Mr. Conlin up with four B.F. Goodrich G-Force T/A’s...  ...and give him ten percent off for having the best costume...
Christmas?  It can’t be Christmas...
I wouldn't know anything about that.
I mean...
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
Relax, it's casual.
No, I mean...I'm a little...dusty...
My step-dad's.  I'm strictly into stone.  I was wondering when you'd walk by.
He's made a few changes.
<u>Should</u>?
This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again.
They're fine.  Everybody <i>else</i>...is fine.
About me?  How sweet.
To help you.  I've run every test known to man.  And they all yield the same result: <u>the machine is ready</u>.
I don't really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds --
The Center for Disease Control.  If this thing is contagious --
Ben, are you there?
Gotcha.  Okay.  Supernova bad.
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
Johnny.
Ben's still out there --
He's had some kind of...reaction to exposure from the cloud.  And he's not the only one.
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
What?  What do you mean you --
That's what we're here to find out.
What in the world would give me that idea?
No.  There weren't.  There was <u>you</u>. And <u>me</u>.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does.
The plants, from space.  Their particles are still charged.  With the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
Please, no apologies.  I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos.  You'll have round-the clock care.
Let's find what the devil's holding them up!  Contact the Proteus!
How bad off is he?
Before he could breathe a word. He's the only scientist who knows the answer to what we're after. That's why we have to operate --
Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
Tell him where he fits in, will you? I've got a few things to check out.
Attack? Who -- or should I say what from?
Not now. We need air, not greetings!
What gives you that idea?
Under a cloud without cause, I take it.
Well, if you happen to be very fond of him -- even in love with him -- it would certainly affect your point of view.
Yes...
If we can go in past the Oculomotor Nerve...
Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late?
We have no alternative. With only six minutes left, we'll just barely make it.
"Proclaiming in incandescent glory The myriad Mind of Man..."
Yes... We can go forward on this course, but it means going directly through the Heart.
Two in a row?
Just what it is. Antibodies, destroying Bacteria -- or any other foreign invader that threatens the System.
I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
That makes two of us.
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
Certainly.
Yeah, well, it depends on the artist. You know, Jose Feliciano, ya got no complaints. Waiter!
I need ...unguent.
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.
Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
I'll see you tomorrow.
Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.  I want you with this money on the Dayton- Radisson parking ramp, top level, thirty minutes, and we'll wrap this up.
...Yah, well, you stay away from Scotty now -
This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time.
That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.
Oh, don't be silly.
Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
Yah, that can happen.
Uhn.
Yah, right -
Yah.
We're gonna get Mom back for ya, but we gotta play ball. Ya know, that's the deal. Now if Lorraine calls, or Sylvia, you just say that Mom is in Florida with Pearl and Marty...
Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.
Yah, so we're all set.
Yah, okay, I'll have my girl send you over a copy, then.
All right, Jerry, you got this phone to yourself?
Know who this is?
Stan Grossman called.
Whatcha watchin' there?
You told me about it.
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.
Yah.
What kind of finder's fee were you looking for?
No, but, Wade, see, I was bringin' you this deal for you to loan me the money to put in. It's my deal here, see?
Say, ya know those two fellas ya put me in touch with, up there in Fargo?
Call 'em up.
I'm fine - it's just morning sickness.
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
You don't think he's mixed up in -
Yah. Say, Lou, ya hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name to J2L 4685?
Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.
Yah.
Yah - how are you doon?
Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.
Yah, ya know it's the Radisson, so it's pretty good.
You're livin' in Edina, then?
Well, yah, I was married. I was married to - You mind if I sit over here?
No, I - Mike - wyncha sit over there, I'd prefer that.
And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.
It's okay, Mike...
Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater.
Yah, is this Marge?
...Well, yah. Who's this?
So... they didn't...
Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.
Gustafson's accountant.
Still missing. We're looking.
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
Don't go in! Wait for back-up!
Copy. Yah, send me back-up!
Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good.
It's terrific!
And his wife?
Oh, my.
Better than I've ever been in my life.
You need to make these your primary "action items."
No, I wasn't aware...
I want brain parasites.
Here.
Do you care?
That day you came over to my place to play doctor... what was going on there?
Say my name!  What's my name!?
I did, I think.  But, I'm okay... I'm fine...
Who's this?
Who's this?
You're a tourist.  I saw you at melanoma, tuberculosis and testicular cancer.
What do you want me to do?
I mean -- for a living.
How's that working out for you?
There's always that.
Delivered from Martha Stewart.
The things you own, they end up owning you.
Don't I?
Yeah.
You called me so you could have a place to stay.
No, I...
Go ahead.  Say it.
I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.
After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "Get a job."  When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know. Get married."
Oh, a new riot control grenade...  "...the successful combination of concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash- blasts and simultaneous high-velocity disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..."
I'm fine.
Hey... don't knock librarians.
She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
I said I promise!
We don't need him...
Okay, and... and...
Look...
Tyler...
I would feel nothing about my life? Is that what you want to hear?!
What?
... is over.
Why did you do that?
Why do people think anything?
I don't know!  Tell me!
Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?
What a ridiculous thing to say.
Green?  Did you say green?
Fuck you.
You want out?
Not my mouth.  Our mouth.
It's the only way to get rid of you...
What?
My eyes are open.
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
You told me you'd say that.
What he wanted?  Look... look at him. Look at him!  What does he want?  This is a person.  This is not a cog in your machine...
We need some towels, Lou.  We need replacement light bulbs.
How'd you know?
Stuff.  That means you have to get more schooling.
The songs on the radio.  But wait.  I don't understand.  Why is this even happening to me?
That's what Alex used to ask himself right up until...
Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition?
So let's do it.
How you doing in there, hero?
Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
And when it was Rory's turn to die, and Thomas was in the way?
I don't think so.  Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it.
Yeah, you should have specified.
Does she have a cell phone?  A way we can contact her?
Eighteen.  And it's "Hebrew".
I never mad it.  The Greyhound bus I was on splattered some chick all over the road and we had to stop.
Yeah, I thought he was supposed to be helpful.
I don't...what if I made a mistake?
Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.
I guess so.
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
He's not a witch.
They blame me for everything. Her, Tod, the plane crash...
All I owe is these people.  To live my life to the fullest.
Been on many planes that blew up, have you?
Did you take any sedatives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping pills?
Oh, you've noticed it, too?
No harm. No foul.
They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
That's what I'm doin'!
Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there.  But this is real, isn't it?  You're taking me home now?
Really?  How come he didn't take me?
There's the Mekong.
That's what I'm here for.
We're leaving tonight, not in a week.
Keep it down, man.  I got problems.
This is state-of-the-art firepower.
There's a compass in the handle.
No.
Fermented fish sauce.
What's that?
Let me see.
Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.
You take pictures and split.  I'm going in.
Yes.
What... whattaya do?
Duck soup.
Forget it.
Crazy motherfucker.
They heard about escaped prisoner on radio.  Make deal.  More than we pay.
Let's get that tent down!
That's an order.
Well, if there weren't POWs before, there are now.
We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
Listen, Kirkhill.  I'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... I thought I'd go out with the extraction team tonight.  Unless you have an objection.
That's a pretty hairy ride.  Full Colonels are supposed to be above that sort of thing.
Not my people.
You think I'm some whacko?  I like to hurt people?  I'm doing a job here.  If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right?  So I follow directives... I do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.
Am I out of here?
That's it.  My life.
Well, I guess I'll come back then.
You threw him out?
Well, there's nobody special!
Fine.
What?
<u>What</u>!
Please... before you go on... let me tawk... okay... We've had a wonderful time together... When we first met, you said this wasn't serious and I shouldn't get serious and then you moved in and we haven't been serious. And I just wanna say that I have no regrets.  None.  And don't wanna have any now so I want ya to be up front with me... I want the truth. If you're seein' somebody else, let me know... You don't have to pour gasoline on yourself and light a match just to break up with me.  Just tell me the truth.
Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You...  ... stay out all night long...
And who's Lydia?
My agent.  I called my agent.
Thanks.
Ya know, I'm thinkin' -- with another income coming in, I would love to get a bigger place.
No, I... I think we should talk about this.
No.  So what time do you need?  I love you -- you love me -- you want to get your career going, great!  I'd like to be a part of it -- I think I deserve that!  So what do you need to figure out alone!?
All right... I'll pack my stuff tonight.
I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
Well, it's not unusual in his case... Sometimes victims of tragedies are subject to the brain's replay system. The brain never loses anything - it just stores it up and waits. A person could actually re-experience the full effect of a tragedy, long after the event took place. Are you relatives?  Well, it doesn't matter. We'll take care of it. He'll have to be sent back to the same institution.. 
Yeah, well... I let him stay there. What else could I do after such a tragedy?
Tragedy?
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
Leave me alone...I wanna go...
People spend a lot of hard earned money for this neighborhood.  It's not fair... looking out their windows to see your ass asleep on the streets...
They're putting me on film tomorrow.
Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
Great place huh?
I know!  You can't imagine how surprised I was.  Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side.
Listen... I don't mean to be flippant or to enrage you or anything but... you're an imbecile.  And I'm not The One... I'm not <u>any</u> One...
No..no, it's..I don't know what to say. This is so nice of you...Jack...
All right! Listen - please...don't start drooling or...rolling your eyes when I tell you this but - You shouldn't do this..There is no Holy Grail.
I don't need a job. I have a quest.
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
So what? You going to help me?
Buddy, the days of the debutantes are ... not what they used to be.
Have you ever done any cloudbusting? You lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds...and you try yo break them apart with your mind. It's wild.
Maybe, when we get the Grail...
In a bar called Hellfire.
BINGO! Tell the man what he's won!
You're out numbered son.
... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
And then we'll exchange phone numbers and you'll leave and never call and I'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch.  Why am I putting myself through this?  It was very nice... uh meeting you. Good night..
So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now...  ... I'm not coming up to your apartment.  That was never my idea.
You're married.
No, I...
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
A wig?
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
You're goin' a find me dead one time.
I'll tell you...  ... l-a-t-e-r.
Who said I was depressed?
We'll get off in Washington and hook another ride.
Alaska.
Shut up.  You have bread, don't you, and a toaster of some kind?
Well, I don't claim to have sold 'em all. They still have some left, I believe.
Well, I don't mean to.  Here's your tea, Tita.
This is a very special, very old CB 275...
Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
Daddy's very ill.
Well, I'll be seeing you in a couple of days, won't I?
With applesauce?
Why are you being so mean?
I'm not. He does walk funny. Don't you see that?
Yeah, well, he's...
My turn.
What would I do with it? Run amok?
Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
Why?
No, it isn't what I think.
Yes, that's what's important to me...
That's what you said?
Of course I'd like to.
For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
Right, steam. A car you could ride around in and not cause a stink. But do you know, they will not even let us have it. Can you believe it? Why?! Man! He likes to create a stink. I wrote them a note once, and told them to clean it... I mean, don't you see that? It's just filthy! I mean, I've seen filth you wouldn't believe! Oofh, what a stink! I don't even want to talk about it...
Well, she was.
God, I just wanna speak to you. I just wanna speak to you the way I feel about you.
Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
You look good.
I buy them flowers.
Fa what?
Forget it! C'mon Let's go to the pool.
I'll be right down.
I think he's 18 or 17.
She's like this high, dark hair, skinny
Positive.
What?
So, then whadda ya want?
We'd have no way of knowing that, sir.
Sally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn't work in your office, she's not from around here.
Sonofabitch.
Not luck. They don't want me.
You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?
Full name.
Fletch F. Fletch
For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin...
Its been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column.
Really. The California Racquet Club?
Well, which one?
For sure?
You don't know me.
I'm serious, Sam.
For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy gave me a deposition.
You find the source?
Right. Fine.
Yes, right away.
My associates did a biopsy on this man recently.  He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it.
I guess not.
I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
My lawyer was a bum.
Of course.
California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
It’s okay. The cops did it.
I know. I got bad luck or something.
Wait here for me, Gummy.
I don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. After that... well, I'd rather not be around for it.
My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
You sure got the hard part.
Shoot.
His bride. Cute as a button.
No, thank you.
I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are.
You are a rich woman.
None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off.
I ordered lunch.
Down boy.
What is this?
What does all this mean?
Stop it.  Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?
You shouldn't be here.
Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill.
Very good sir.
No wonder.
I commend him on his choice.
I commend him on his choice
No, I want an answer, Is the story done?
Who?
How gray?
I want something I can print!
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. 
Not really?
Of course.
Please.
Nonsense.  After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.
I'll do my best.
Great pipes.
Exactly.
Cash or check, Jazz?  Don't do this to me.
Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.
You're saying you need money.
Shut up, goodies from the ice queen.
Contacts.
Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
I've always said the one reason I'm the best detective in the industry is that I'm the only one... but hey, I never throw away a clue...
I can't believe I lost an eye for a bunch of phony C.D.s
It's Spunk Lewis, the lead singer for Dead Ribbit!  Mr. Bus Driver, stop!
You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
Ye-ah.  Sure.
Forget it.
These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know...
Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
The point?
Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.
Golly, I'd probably faint.
Don't play games... ugh.  Did you say you don't have the third... ugh.  I'm not going to torture <u>you</u>, Ford.
What is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?
Accident?  Accident!  You naive pussball, when I realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry.  I <u>cut my fucking</u> <u>ears off</u> so I'd only hear <u>my</u> music. Here, look.
It is to us!  It's computerised.
No - no.
Got a wife named Angie.
Don't forget anchovies. 
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Yes --
You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!
Non!
Une erreur!  C'est génial.  C'est une vedette à la télévision.  Il peut aller partout sans être soupçonné... En plus il a besoin de fric.
What happens to the schedule?
But will they?
It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.
Who financed it?
Get up on the bar and show me how you work.  If I like it you don't have to go in.
Marseilles.

Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?
Walter, I can make this case if the Feds will get the hell out of my way.
How about that time you were picking your feet in Poughkeepsie?
He coulda been white.
Not a chance.
The other guy's a frog too.  Checked in at the Edison.  Had a hooker sent up.
Then fuckin' find it.  I'm going for the girl.
I'd go with you and Chinese take-out over her any time.
Did he?
It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
I love you more.
Okay...
I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come outside.
I think you know, Frank.
No.  This isn't what you think.
Are you listening to me?  You're in a world of shit.  An eye witness has you outside the dead girl's apartment.  We got your prints all over the place.  Plus the fucking driver's license, Frank.  You gotta give me something here. Something I can believe.
How's that?
Get him home safe.
Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.
I been Q-ing you all night.  How the hell did you do it?
What'd you say your name was?
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
My dad's name was Frank Patrick Sullivan, he was a fire fighter and a die-hard Mets fan.  And every night when I went to bed he sang to me...  Take me out to the ball game, take me out with the crowd...
I'm not dreaming.
I don't know.
We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.
I think I'm losing you.
But you're not...you're not still here.
On the job?
I don't understand.
So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
Satch is busting me for Sissy Clark's murder.  John...
Sully!  Is that you?
I talked to him Gordo.  I talked to my Dad.
Better.
What?
Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.
This case just got hot.  We pull on this string...
Sounds good.
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
Look who's talking.
Are you a good cop, John?
Where are you going?
Going?  How do you mean?
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
I don't know...
I vote for me.
What?
Will you come with me?
It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs.
Your bed.
Have you ever made love in a hammock?
I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?
Sort of.
In that little thing?
Yes.
That's it.  We're driving this baby back to town... in reverse.
He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
I could swear I heard...
Yes.  And I said, hand me those padlocks.
Are they grown-ups?
Why not?  I used to play it alone. I love murder games.  Have you ever played The Consulting Detective?
There's no time for this bullshit...
Please, Sheriff.  You'll see we dug it up.
They coulda danced a jig on it an' fed it to goats -- don't matter.  Ya' can't kill Jason by gettin' rid of his body.  He'll come back the way he always do, to drag the kiddies into the darkness and crush their little skulls -- maybe even your skull, Mr. Campbell.
I understand.  However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.
Do you have to ask?
That's very colorful, chief.
That's what I'd like to know.
Tell me!
Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
Listen, since I got you on the phone -- ask the guys there if they wanna chip in for a hooker.  I'll send her right over.  Her name is Vicki.
Okay.
She did!
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
I mean really never.
A pizza?!
I don't care about being hip anymore.
Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...
What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.
Time to check out the waiters.
Hear what?
Rennie's not coming.
This is Jason's fault!
They're out of town.
I don't think that's such a safe idea
Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull down anybody who falls in and can't swim.
I'm staying.
I'm staying.
But Sean said...
But what about the drowning boy I've been seeing?
Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.
After your parents passed away?
No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or LORAN?
We changed our minds.
Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you.
What do you mean???
The window...
Don't talk like that.
I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
We must abandon.
I think we Nought to wait.
What about the haircut?
He'll kill it. He'll write a review so devastating it will shatter your career and cause the most unmanageable psychic grief. What happens to your apartment on the East River? Your house in Connecticut, where you watch things grow.
Let's work on it.
This could be it.
You know about Adele.
I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
In and out of bed.
I go to college. I thought you knew.
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
Why do you need a radio?
Opening night?
I'm not sure.
A flat-out hit.
What's sexy?
I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
It violates so many trusts.
I respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi. But let's put a lid on the questions.
One more out.
This could be it!
I'm at the door.
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
I'm on my way to get a haircut.
It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
Where's your elastic brace?
I'll go get you another one. You have to wear it.
I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.
Everybody else does. Why not you?
You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
"It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day."
You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.
This could be it!
I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?
So what happened since? You're worried about this kid who writes these reviews?
Postpone. We have every right.
Too late. All the elements are in place. Delay the opening and we lose the theater.
You're dangling from the last letter of your last name.
How come?
What color?
I kissed her while she was laughing.
Yes.
I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love.
Oh. You know him.
Endearing.
A little drastic maybe?
I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.
No one's waiting.
Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs.
As I told you about English policemen.
"I will follow close behind you and help to serve the people."
I'm sorry.
No, no -- just a moment, please.
I think if we all worked to publicize it... all of the Congress... every avenue we know.
You will respect the law.
There are unjust laws -- as there are unjust men.
Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand.  It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.
No. You were the surprise. It's been all over the prison. We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press.
I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
...an eye for an eye making the whole world blind.
Bapu -- please. Where are you going.
Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?
Now is your chance to find out.
He's right, Maria.  That's right.
So there's a 20 percent chance he's <i>not</i> dead.
This is a murder investigation.  The public should be happy to co-operate, to get this disease off the streets.
No.  But one or two "borrowed ladders" have shown up there in the past.
A man can change his face--but blood is forever. Sample every employee within the parameters I gave you.  Intravenous.
Surely you know what you have.
This time I will supervise each test personally.
Hello, sweatheart.  Come on up.
Could be worse.  They could have found it in your eye.
I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
Is that all?
If you say so.  The stripe.
Never stopped you before.  And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.
I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer.
It happened in Australasia.  He checked in yesterday.  No family complications, no record he ever broke his neck.  As far as anybody's concerned, he's still a walking, talking, fully-productive member of society. You just have to get him off the pipe and fill in the last two years of his life.  Excuse me, <i>your</i> life.
Even with lifts I'm never that tall.
There's a way.
I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
No it can't be verified.  Yes I was alone.
I was at home.
It was a mercy-killing after all.
I guess somebody beat me to it.
Come on.
You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.
Antonio--
You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.
Assumed name... Houston.
Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.
No. It's been a long time.
Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.
You got the parole, didn't you?
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
If we are clean Gollie will take us over at Nogales. If we are hot we'll have to try Laughlin at El Paso.
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
Jackson panicked and nailed the guard.
There are three men dead.
He might be ready to chop us up.
Who's she?
He must have.
I'll bet you can.
Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.
If I hadn't killed Beynon., you would have.
Let's do it.
Listen to me. It's hard enough.
I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...
That's all I want... It's the only thing I have ever wanted.
Yeah.
If they are not here, he must have sent them away.
Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.
I guess we are.
No, I'm not.
That certainly makes you kind of special...
I really hope you have a nice trip.
Thanks. Hope you do too.
Tell her you robbed a bank...
I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
Okay. How many bank exits?
What about the vault?
Aren't we going a little hard?
Growing -- all of them - every day.  318, you'll be the only ones on the floor.
Just sandwiches...
Not now.
That's what I want.
Wish you hadn't said that. When Slim Canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed.
That's not possible. We can't leave here... we've got all this.
I know.
Did Eric Pake pull her?
Yes.
Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?
'Good.'
I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
I had to. It was the only way I could get at them.
Good evening.
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
You stay in the car. I'll come and listen.  What you want to tell me, Thorpey?
Yes you can.
Who sent you, Thorpey?
Doreen.
Yes.
Could you do me a favour?
Could you please put my glass on the table?
He must have been pretty sure I'd come.
Entertaining.
Not entirely. No.
Well, it's Carter. That's my name,  And her father was my brother. And he was murdered last Sunday. Now get up and get dressed.
At the Half Moon.
Yeah.
I see.
You sure?
My brother, Frank.
Is he staying the night?
I'm sorry.
I'll call the police.
Pension him off.
You're a bastard.
What am I supposed to do?  I don't know where they've taken him. Do you?
That's not always a healthy way to be...
Nasty way to go.
Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle.  Now, where are we?
All of 'em.  They, hey: it happens to us all.
Where am I going to work?
I'm not?
They came in and they, you know...
...this shit...
No.
That's right?
And so they kill the goose.  I, I, I'll...and a fuckin' man, worked all his life has got to...
Nurses.
Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for yourself.  The hard part is...you know what it is?
You...
You build it!
Men come work for you...
Look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no.  No.  You're absolutely right, and I want to tell you something.
Huh.
What could we get for them?  I don't know.  Buck a throw...buck-a- half a throw...I don't know...Hey, who knows what they're worth, what do they pay for them?  All told...must be, I'd... three bucks a throw...I don't know.
Talking about it as a...
Not actually, no.
No.  Not actually.
What did he say?
You have to steal the leads tonight?
That's right, the guys are moving them downtown.  After the thirtieth. Murray and Mitch.  After the contest.
I...
It's not something for nothing, George, I took you in on this, you have to go.  That's your thing. I've made the deal with Graff.  I can't go.  I can't go in, I've spoken on this too much.  I've got a big mouth.  "The fucking leads" et cetera, blah blah blah "...the fucking tight ass company..."
They come to you, you going to turn me in?
Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact.
Why?  Why, because you only told me about it?
If anyone's going, I could use some coffee.
What?  You can't do any what?
I am?
You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
He filed half of them, he filed the big one.  All the little ones, I have, I have to go back and...ah, fuck, I got to go out like a fucking schmuck hat in my hand and reclose the...  I mean, talk about a bad streak. That would sap anyone's self confi... I got to go out and reclose all my... Where's the phones?
...what am I going to do all month...
They aren't?
No.
At home.
No, who?
Oh, God, I hate this job.
I didn't...why should I..."Where were you last..." Is anybody listening to me...?  Where's Moss...?  Where...?
The leads come in, I'll let...
Will you get out of here.  Will you get out of here.  Will you.  I'm trying to run an office here.  Will you go to lunch?  Go to lunch. Will you go to lunch? 
Moss...Who told him?
What two?
Not lately it isn't.
Let me...
Let me tell you something, Shelly. I do what I'm hired to do. I'm...wait a second.  I'm hired to watch the leads.  I'm given...hold on, I'm given a policy.  My job is to do that.  What I'm told.  That's it.  You, wait a second, anybody falls below a certain mark I'm not permitted to give them the premium leads.
Then how do they come up above that mark?  With dreck...?  That's nonsense.  Explain this to me. 'Cause it's a waste, and it's a stupid waste.  I want to tell you something...
The premium leads.  Yes.  I know what they cost.  John.  Because I, I generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them.  Nineteen senny-nine, you know what I made? Senny-nine?  Ninety-six thousand dollars.  John?  For Murray... For Mitch...look at the sheets...
Will you please wait a second. Shelly.  Please.  Murray told me: the hot leads...
The leads are assigned randomly...
Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?
I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...
Now.  Yes...When?
I can't do it, Shelly...
I can't split them.
That's alright.
The deal still stands, our other thing.
Did you tell 'em my sale?
That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...
I...
That was easy, wasn't it?
Call up the bank.  I called them.
"...you have to believe in yourself..."
"...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..."
Ricky?...That I don't care they stole the contracts?
Shelly...!
Hey, big fucking deal.  Broke a bad streak...
"Always be closing..."
That's what I'm saying.  The old ways.  The old ways...convert the motherfucker...sell him...sell him... make him sign the check.  The...Bruce, Harriet...the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds...I say fuck it, we're going to go the whole route. I plat it out eight units.  Eighty- two grand.  I tell them. "This is now.  This is that thing that you've been dreaming of, you're going to find that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that's full of money.  This is it, Harriett..."
...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
You're a client.  I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry Farms.  I rub my head, throw me the cue "Kenilworth."
What is it?
Beautiful.  Beautiful rolling land. I was telling Jim and Jinny, Ray, I want to tell you something.  You, Ray, you eat in a lot of restaurants.  I know you do... 
Ah.  Ah, his wife is.  Ray: what time do you have...?
I've got to get Ray to O'Hare...  Come on, let's hustle...  John!  Call American Express in Pittsburgh for Mr. Morton, will you, tell them he's on the one o'clock. 
She called the consumer...the attorney, I don't know.  The attorney gen...they said we have three days...
Of course you have three days.
I'm not.
But I'm not counting it.  Wednesday.  Thursday.  Friday.  So it would have elapsed.
Tuesday.
I don't know.
I told you.
We'll speak to her, Jim...
The "deal," forget the deal. Forget the deal, you've got something on your mind, Jim, what is it?
What are the police doing here...?
When...
And fuck you.  Fuck the lot of you. Fuck you all.
They got, listen to me...
You did?
Then I'm over the fucking top and you owe me a Cadillac.
Okay, okay, okay, gimme this shit. Fine. 
I know.  How long will you be gone?
That's right.
This man informs to the police; this man allows his vengeance to be bought off... No, he is alone.
Michael...
It was my father's money; and I'm entitled to what I need.  Where is Tom Hagen?
I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
You would risk your life for strangers?
I'm not afraid of his words.
I understand...
You remember Willy Cicci, don't you, Freddie?  We was all together with the old man Clemenza in Brooklyn... before...uh...
Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.
I'd like to come along.  There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days.
I never looked down on you, Fredo. You don't look down at a brother.
It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
What is it?  Can I help?
We have time.
I've always taken care of you.
It wasn't the way I wanted it!  I can handle things.  I'm not dumb Christ, not like everyone says. I'm smart; and I want respect.
He's an Italian?
What?
I'm going to see my parents.
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.
What the hell does that mean?  Come on, Tom, speak out straight once in your life.  I know Michael can't, but you're not Sicilian, you can tell a woman the truth; you can treat her like an equal, a fellow human being.
I don't know.  I hope soon; but it's not over yet, and that's why you and the kids have to come back to me.
We don't know that's true, he never said that.
Talk to him.  Tell him how you feel.
Yes.
Connie's outside.
What was it, so I'll know.
Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead.
The new government arrested him, held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people, including Roth's brother, Sam.  The American Embassy arranged flights for citizens; I'm not sure, but I think he's somewhere in New York.
I want you to reach Fredo.  I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him.  Assure him that there will be no reprisals.  Tell him that I know Roth misled him.
He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
That plane goes to Miami...
Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've always been loyal to you.
I'd like to go outside with him, in the open air.
That's my brother.  Nothing could get him away from that two mule town.  He coulda been big over here -- he could of had his own Family.
You know there's a Senate Investigating Committee recently set up; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though-provoking to your name.
No one can trace anything to me; I pride myself on that.
Maybe two, three thousand dollars.
Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
I don't think that's necessary.
This meeting is adjourned.
The committee is adjourned until further notice.
I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left.  Won't you join us, Mr. Ola?
Why too late?
I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.
No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!
There are still things I have to do.
It means... &quot;The Lie.&quot;
Six million dollars in cash is a high price for a piece of a country in the middle of a revolution.
Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
Very impressive.
Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?
Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.
No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed.
Always... But sometimes I don't understand.  I know I'll never have your kind of brains, in big deals. But Mike, this is a street thing. And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind the Rosato Brothers.
Sure, Mike.  I'll go along.
I trust these men with my life. They are my right arms; I cannot insult them by sending them away.
I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.
What was that?
He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
What are you then?  What will you be ten years from now?  Still cutting lawns?  Still banging horny divorcees in your trailer?
Sure you're free, for now at least. But how long before you're just alone?  Pathetic and alone.
Damn straight.  I'm sick of playing games.
What kind of man are you?  Are you a good man?
Why?
You proposing what I think you're proposing?  Don't you think I'm a little young for you?
You did not know?
You and he are not doing things?
What do I do?
Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
I put him to bed.  He's not there?
He wanted me to kill him, but I didn't.  He did it himself.
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.
Just that I was in the Marines.
What?  Oh yes.
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.
Merely comfortable.  Here's Hanna with our refreshments.  Can you get the door?
Nothing serious.  A touch of stroke.
You went to university?
You mean -- you really want to draw me?
No, you were middle class, like all Americans.
In Dudley there were more sides of the tracks than any American can imagine.  Every Englishman knows his place.  And if you forget, there's always someone to remind you.  My family had no doubts about who they were.  But I was an aberration in that household a freak of nature.  I had imagination, cleverness, joy.  Where did I get that?  Certainly not from them.
Did you now?
Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.
Why?  Was it supposed to be funny?
Quite true.  Hand-to-hand combat is the true test.  Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?
What is we say phooey to the hedges?  Could you spare an hour after lunch?  To sit for me?
I never thought you were.
But we have to match the other sketch.
Very well put.
It's so far in the past now.  Over fifteen years --
Twenty years.  Too long.  We were like a play whose run outlasted the cast's ability to keep it fresh. So I finally decided to close down the show.
Everybody has stories to tell.
I was an officer.
You don't want me to sit for you anymore?
Neither of us really belongs here.
Can't you see?  It's raining!
Catch my death.
Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?
Never gave it much thought.
I don't remember that one.
It's too tight.
I haven't done a damn thing with you!
I told you.  I don't turn on the TV except for the fights.
You remember how a production eats up one's life.
Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to.  You'll be fine on your own?
In a manner of speaking.  I've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but I'm sure they're related.
I am not forgetting your last brief chat.
No.  I do not cook for them.  My daughter's no-good husband will not take one bite of our food.
No.  I never said you were.  Or will be soon.
Will you tell me everything you remember about making "Frankenstein"?
Okay.  "Frankenstein."  Tell me everything.
My idea.  Muchly.  My sketches. Big heavy brow.  Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.
Tell me about Kip -
I knew you'd say that.
Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...
How is he?
What for?
How's Atley -- ?
Get out of here, then. Now.
You know my back.
A little family emergency --
What are you still doing here, Randall?
You know my back.
Double-meaning intended --
No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...
Yeah.
We're partners here --
Donny-nothin'!
Hey, Donny --
Hell, yeah. Mirror Man here is our electronics expert. He's got some gadgets you old farts maybe never -heard of; Tumbler can drive anything with wheels, and some things without; Toby's a hacker, can do things with a computer, that are pretty amazing ...
What color?
How you doing, man?
All I get are the Orientals. They can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em So? What are you doing here? What's with the outfit -- ?
You know where the others are?
It's arright ...
You, too, Ma...
Atley Jackson. How is that one? How's the leg... ?
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...
I heard you were pumping gas -
You're kind of cultivating a new look.
"About what?"
I can handle it --
Me.
Shadow games ...
It's for assholes. The Legal Buck blows, Memphis.  You know that. Doing this, we make mad bank, my boys are down, the girlies come around and the boosts are a breeze. Yeah, sure, you're gonna get jacked-up every now and then - but ain't that a small price to pay for never, never-ever, having to say "paper or plastic?"
I dunno. Whatever will be will be...
What?
She's for sale. They're asking forty thousand. Give 'em sixty ...
We can't do that, dude --
Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -
It's going fine. The Quiet Riot and me are swapping trade secrets ...
On account of me.
That what you want?
That's what I want ...
No ... ?
A little trick I picked up at the Car Thief Retirement Home ...
I take out my slim-jim...
Let me worry about The Club ...
He's gotten involved --
Tell me...
Is he still working here ?
The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
His criminal career has officially come to a close ...
I'll see you soon --
Who's "Eleanor?"
So she flies -
So what's in there -- ?
Wha?  Me?
I understand.
Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.
How much?
What's the matter with you?  You're crazy.
The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?
I'm just having my last few drinks.
I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.
Don't worry about it. You listening to me? Now, come on. We gotta go see Paulie.
Hello!  Hello!  Have a good flight?
Paul will calm down. You'll see.
Just get me out.
Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money.
I got seared.
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
I better call again.
Jimmy and I could never be made, because we bad Irish blood. It didn't even matter that my mother was Sicilian. To become a member of a crew, you've got to be one hundred percent Italian So that they can trace all your relatives back to the old country.
I can't make any more deliveries.
I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
What could I do?  If she insisted, I had to drive her home for her goddamn hat.  I threw the package in the kitchen and went to take her hone.
Tommy.  Come on. Relax.
Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend?  For Chrissake.  Come on.  You don't even have to stay.  Jeesuz!  What's the big deal?
He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.
Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night.
I don't want them left back.
You think that matters?  You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.
Oh shit.
Oh, Morgan!
--or a tail--
Probation, counselin', few days a week.
It's a way outta here.
Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
How you doin'?
Well, I don't have no trousers on...
--and he's like "shit! Motherfucker!" And he looks in his rearview and sees this cat-- I'm sorry--
You could put a pool in that backyard.
I told you, I just got change.
I'm serious Chuckie, I ain't goin'.
Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before.
Oh, Morgan.
Shut the fuck up.
History.
Hey, I'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar. But as long as you're here I want to "seize" the opportunity to ask you a question.
Codebreaking.
Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building--
Which one's your building?
Building two.
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
Yes. Under two conditions.
Of course.
I think so.
C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work.
Then don't set up any more meetings.
It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.
Yeah, cured polio.
The Field's Medal is the Nobel Prize for math.  But it's only given out every four years.
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
Where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age--
Why would he do that?
I live right around the corner.
Well, have you talked to him at all about his future?
Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
--I'm not angry at you--
Who is he?
Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift.
Yeah, I read your book. "Mike" had the same problems as "Chad" the stockbroker.
Who is "Danny Terrio?"
Have you read all these books, Will?
How about the ones on that shelf?
I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're your books, why don't you read 'em?
You people baffle me. You spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books-- and they're the wrong fuckin' books.
What does?
I was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occured to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since. You know what occurred to me?
Fine.
I gave that up when my wife got sick.
When did you know she was the one?
"I gotta go see about a girl"? What did they say?
Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate.
Not to me, they're not.
That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
I didn't ask for this.
You're right, Will. Any man who takes a forty minute train ride so those college kids can come in in the morning and their floors will be clean and their trash cans will be empty is an honorable man.
Look, a lot of that stuff goes back a long way.  And it's between me and him and it has nothing to do with you.
I used to go with the wrench.
It's not your fault.
I know.
Only if you grab my ass.
See, it's my life story. Five more minutes and I would have got to hear your best pick-up line.
It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
It was great. There was always someone to play with, give you advice.
No.
They don't come over here that much.
I think I can make it to South Boston.
I'd say...  It's only four in the mornin', they're prob'ly up.
Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?
I want you to come with me.
'Cause that's a serious thing you're sayin'. I mean, we might be in California next week and you could find out somethin' about me that you don't like. And you might feel like "hey this is a big mistake."  But you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back. Now I'm in California, 'cause you asked me to come. But you don't really want me there. And I'm stuck in California with someone who really doesn't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back.
What do you mean "What am I afraid of?"
I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died.
I'm not honest?
What about your twelve brothers?
No, you don't want to hear that.
Well, I'm contracting the land.
Joe!
I never knowed they was anything like her!
*Some*body got to take the blame. They just *got* to hang it on somebody, you know.  An' I ain't doin' nothin' but set around.
Sure. Why not?
That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.
But ef you *do* whup me, I swear you better not ever go to sleep again, because the minute you go to sleep, or you're settin' down, or your back's turned, I'm gonna knock you belly-up with a bucket.
Lots must a died, too.
How many of you?
They don't get in here. Sometimes the boys patrol the fences, especially dance nights.
Government.
Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.
Excuse me for asking.
I'll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. Well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' I give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that.
I ain't no preacher anymore.
It's hard to say. Stay here till mornin' an' then go on over to Uncle John's, I reckon. After that I don't know.
Casy! What you doin' here?
Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?
I don't expeck we can las' much longer-- some a the folks ain't et for two days. You goin' back tonight?
Save your strength, lady.  Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.
Just a few miles. I'd a walked her if my dogs wasn't pooped out.
Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
You been acrost?
If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
It don't take no nerve to do somep'n when there ain't nothin' else you can do. 
And can't nobody *make* me go, either! Ain't nobody here *man* enough to make me! I'm a-stayin'.
No plants.
Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?
Go get Tom an' Al.  I dunno what to do. I got to feed the fambly. What'm I gonna do with these here?
How come I got to shh? Run out, didn't he?
I'd a found you, Ma.
I'm ready.
Your pa tol' me you didn't ought to cross it if you're paroled. Says they'll send you up again.
No.
Well, tomorra you'll get in a full day--full day's pay--an' we'll have plenty.
Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.
Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier.
I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But--  --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.
Then what, Tom?
Sure. Good-by.
The rest of my fambly set out for the west--there wasn't nothin' to eat--but I couldn't leave. Somepin' wouldn't let me. So now I just wander around. Sleep wherever I am. I used to tell myself I was lookin' out for things, so when they come back ever'thing would be all right. But I knowed that wan't true. There ain't nothin' to look out for. And ain't nobody comin' back. They're gone-- and me, I'm just an 'ol graveyard ghost--that's all in the world I am.
I can't help that. All I know is I got my orders. They told me to tell you you got to get off, and that's what I'm telling you.
Me an' you both.
We gonna stay, ain't we?
Keep qui'te, will ya! Shet your mouth!
Lissen. You done busted it. You hear?  But lissen here. I won't tell nobody, y'understan'?
What's this?
Morning.
Ain't gonna be no trouble.
I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Yes I do.
You do not.
Sometimes we sell them to McDonald's and just change them to special barbecue sauce.
Whatever I can get away with.
What?
Fine, Bob. How are you?
Really?
You could've been a contender, huh?
Overflowing with love.
Uh, no. So you're back now, a decade later, and you want to sort things out with me. The question now is, do I allow you... access... to my being?
Bad people.
What's that?
Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in.
What?
Wow. I have to give this some thought.
Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.
It's something I do...
Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other...
Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
I'm staying here.
Other people can't.
We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.
Shouldn't you be taking notes?
Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.
I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor.
I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving.
Hey, Bob.
I don't think so.
--Nooo--
It was the PLO.
-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.
They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.
Never enough.
I'll do it tomorrow.
I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
You don't have a headache. I have a headache.
Paul?
You too.
Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
That's too bad.
I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
I'm a professional killer.
Well, that'll be a little complicated --
You stand still too long in New York you get hit by a bicycle messenger.  You know, sometimes, I get the feeling, Mr. Booker, that you're laughing at me. Why is that?
Does Chicago count?
Just who's been laughing at who here?
I thought you lived in Chicago?
I thought you were an editor, not a reporter?
You too.
You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...
Son?
How did you meet her?
Ever think of moving there full time?
Why?
Okay.
It's still early. What's your next class?
I brought it to you in the hospital.
I didn't know I had to.
You know what I mean?  Is this it now? Is this the way we're going to be from now on?
Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
I don't believe this!
That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.
Did he mention it?
When? Tonight?
I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
That's not true.
Yeah. Bye.
All our "favorite" people were there saying all their "favorite" things about their "favorite" subjects. I thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with.
Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.
I'm in charge. I went back very soon after the accident. They didn't expect me for a couple of months. I'll just take that time now... I can still oversee things from Montana... Take my fax... My computer...
I'm not pretending anything!
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
When are you coming home?
Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her.
I can see why you put your faith in him. He's a genuine... good guy... Good at what he does. That's rare.
How are you feeling about work?
Let's not talk about that now.
Yeah, what?
Take your time.
Mmm. I made good time.  Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.
Where to?
Either fight the way things are or accept it.
I was there for that shot, actually.
Sounds like something Tom would say.
Yes, it does.
He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land.
I already know the way... and it's not like I have a job I have to rush home for.  Between you and me, I could use the time alone.
Promise.
- See, what you can do for him --...
Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it.
We should be fine, then.
And next time, Miss Annie, you can run down the calves...
I don't think Warren would go for that.
Twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch.
Not a question of if you can -- you are. Just keep your eyes on the road and your foot on the pedal and the rest will take care of yourself.
Sure.
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
So?
I want to see Pilgrim.
I did. He said he had work to do until late.
I don't any woman in New York. But from what I hear, most of them are wound up.
Well... Dale... you know, a lot of this stuff... it just... nuts and bolts.
Hack the Planet!
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks. Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that won't fit on a shelf.
The sensitive type.
Dead?
Mm-hmm.
Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin!
Hmmm.
What did we learn in school today?
Give it up! Just give it up.
You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
Do my ears deceive me?
Okay, thank you.
And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.
I got a record. I was Zero Cool.
It's my subway defense system.
Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques.  Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem?
I think we've got something.
Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool?  A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
Gill.
Cancer, brain... Brain Cancer?
Joey, Joey...
Love, secret, and uh, sex.  But not in that order, necessarily, right?
Hey, it's me.
What?
From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.
So?
Not everything. But enough to implicate us.
"Minor glitch" with you seems to turn into a major catastrophe.
555-4202.
Real charmer.
Okay sure. What about?
I'm not angry it's just
You don't owe me anything.
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
Go!
An accident?
It's okay..it's okay.
For Christ sakes. Spare me the speech. I've listened to it for a decade.  The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient, and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law.
How many people in the bus?
Outside.
Al here lost his boy 10 years back.
But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you can't.
He's coming to get me Rachel.
Well try dammit!
I've got you come on, go down.
Fact it Rach, you are desperate.  Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.
Its not over yet.
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
Yeah in the trunk of my squad.
What are we doing?
He's here, Sheriff.
It isn't a man.
Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?
Anything for a fellow pilgrim. Sometimes we need help getting where we want to be.  Reverend Jackson Pete Sayer of Dumon County, please to make your aquanauts.
Sure.
Exploring uncharted territory?
I have a place for that.
Terrific. I've got three choices. Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda screw, or talk to you.
Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
I've already lost it.
Sure, see you later.
That's probably all he can do.
Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.
You guys will make a fabulous couple.
This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
If you watch her, I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning.
Lindsey, open the door! I'm locked in the laundry room!
I want to stay here and watch this.
Annie probably took Lindsey out or something. Let's look for a note.
Want a beer?
Yeah.
Go get me a beer.
I'll be here.
He isn't a man.
As usual, I don't have anything to do.
No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
Same time, same place.
Just watch.
See you.
What about the rest of my comic books?
After the Jack-O-Lantern.
What about the bogyman?
You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.
That's the idea. Here we are.
Only minimum security.
What does that mean?
Oh.
Mmm.
...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?
Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it.  He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
Gee, um...  I...I don't know what to say.
Yeah, it was funny, it was very funny.  But the show was about the two Frenchmen, now that was funny and it was warm.
Do you remember that summer in France?  Hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks.
Is this your first job?
What time do you get off?
Oh, okay.
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
Mm-hm.
Oh, uh, about a month ago.  Wha- what do I have?
Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing.  Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something?
You know, there's no reason for panic.  I just want to rule out some things.
It's nothing.  Will you trust me?
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
Well, are...are they big?
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve.  It reminded me of you.
But I go nuts.  It's a conflict.
Oh, that's nice.
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
But-but, but how about you?  Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
I want you to take care of me... And I love when you do things to me.
Oh, not here.  There are too many people around.
Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.
If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
I care a great deal about him, yes.
Holly and April, thanks for helping.
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
No!
Me?  Of course not. HANNAH There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you.
So, just 'cause I was born that way... You know, I'm old enough to make a mature decision.
No, nothing.
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
Lee...  you are the only person I can be with...who I really look forward to being with. 
I'm not your pupil.  I was, but I'm not.
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!
But who?  Where did you meet him?
Jesus...Jesus!
Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.
Hello?
But there's nothing wrong with you.
No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.
Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
Oh, me, I'm okay.
Y-yeah.
He's fine.
I know, I know.
...so I, so I like that.  I always like an underconfident person...
...you know?  I, uh...
Thanks, thanks.
How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?
W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.
Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.
True.
I'd have been a great dope addict.
Yeah.
Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy...  and some old debts I have outstanding.
Are we talking about cocaine again?
Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you.
Uh-huh.
Look, everything's going your way.
But what I decided to do is some writing.  Yeah, I think I've had it with acting.  You know, these meaningless auditions at cattle calls.  And I can't handle another rejection.  Now let's face it here.  I gotta, you know, latch on to something in my life.  You know--something with a future.  I'm not sixteen anymore.  It's just...crazy!  I've got...an idea for a story. More than one.  And I just need a few months, you know, or, uh, a year even.
I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
Oh, so loosely.
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."
And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?
...I had a great time tonight, really.  It was like the Nuremberg Trials.
Good.  How are you?
Well...
Yeah.
Nobody ever said it.
No, the reason I ask is--
You have.
I've done no television whatsoever. No.
What...what about your script?  So what's it about?
Oh, no!  It wasn't anything bad. But she just... you know.  I don't know.
I should have kept going.  I-I have a sneaking feeling, a nagging sensation I should've kept walking and...
Really?
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
It was just great.  Uh, I was all set...I was set to be bored stiff.
Uh, gee.  Would you like to have lunch?  Uh, uh...
Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.
Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?
Just a few minutes ago.
You know, I was talking with your father before...and I was telling him that  it's ironic.  I-I used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and I never thought  that I could love anybody else.  And here it is, years later and I'm married to you  and completely in love with you.  The heart is a very, very resilient little muscle.  It really is.  I...  It'd made a great story, I think. A guy marries one sister...  doesn't work out...  many years later...  he winds up  married to the other sister.  It's, you know, it's a...
A reward for what?
Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
Yes?
Why me?
You want me to be?
And have <u>you</u> found Peace..? 
You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....
...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're... 
Well, you wanna shoot <u>back</u>, it give you a big <u>target</u>...
I know her by the Back.
Who called the <u>TV CREWS</u>...?
What's up...?
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
...what a world.
That's why my wife adores me.
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
You give me whatever I want...?
Yes.  You know I will.  That's right.
Now, why in the world would he do that?
Try Barney Clark.
No, no, of course not.
..suitcase...locker...
....what...? 
'fraid it's too late.
He requests your presence, once again, as part of...
I had... one moment, I had an <u>agent</u> in there, waiting for <u>backup</u> from...
And how did she get close enough to disarm you?
One moment, I'm not done with you...  Give him the file...
How's your <u>child</u>?
I have had many excellent meals there.
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
...how so?
Yes, I think I amused them.  To what do I owe...?
We got KittyKat...
Yes.  Franklin, you can't live there anymore.  With Mama and Shirly and Kittykat.  You have to go away.
Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
You were given backup....
...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...
I realize, you're under a lot of....
<u>Perhaps</u>... shall we <u>see</u>...?
He saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it...
The girl needs help.
...what has she done to harm you...?
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
...not to turn around.
I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet.
I met a man, and His Troubles Were Greater Than Mine...
N'not <u>that</u> sad.
You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
I don't understand.
...why are we here in the <u>first</u> place...?
Then we cannot go.
Because we cannot <u>pay</u>...
Waal, you c'n only get it in one shop in Alexandria Virginia, n'that's where I'm going, cause I'm goin <u>home</u>, f'i can get n'y'one, Of That Nature, to <u>take</u> her there...
They're grilling the applicant for the Vacant Post.
...yes, yes, yes....
You have no idea. Now run away.
I couldn't tell her...it's, it's too major...Jesus, I'm starting to believe in God and what's worse I think I like the guy. The lightning bolt was just a test, right?  Wendy and I--we're meant to be. I'm right, right?  I have to see her...
Ooh, I'll think of something, missy. A telescope?  Where you going?  I don't want to know.
That wants to be a Yes.
I just don't know about this whole actual sexuality thing--How do you go from being friends with a guy to wanting to put the thing he uses to go to the bathroom with in your mouth?
The oak where Jocelyn sprained her ankle.
Yes, it does.
"...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?
So what?                                                    ]
That's not what I was worried about.
Yeah, we talked about sex, too. Oberon must be sweating in his sleep.
Yeah. I guess I do.
I should leave. You probably need your rest.

It's so you...I didn't think it was possible                        ] for you to make me feel worse,                              ] but...you're saying you <u>deliberately</u>                        ] destroyed us!

What are you doing, Wendy?  What's in that cup?
Don't get cocky, girl.
Nice guys finish last. I should know.
What are you talking about? She hated you! You hated her!  What are you smiling at?
I don't get treated at all, but hey, don't worry about it. I'll do your thing. It'll give my Mom a smile.
Yeah, and who wants that on their teeth?
Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?
Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?
You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.
Give me the clipboard.
If everyone jumped off a bridge, young lady, would you?
No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.
I didn't. Cherry.
It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.
Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word.
Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....
Sure. Can we make an ice run before the funeral?
Don't <u>even</u> talk about that stuff!
"You say tomayto, I say tomahto. Let's call the whole thing off...Hold it!
You want to wipe the slate clean as much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. You have a purpose though! Remember? Let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven.
You're not listening. People are going to look at the ashes of Westerburg and say there's a school that self-destructed not because society didn't care, but because that school <u>was</u> society. Is that deep or what? I'll let you put it in your diary, babe. Free of charge.
You've got power, Veronica. Power I didn't think you had. The slate is clean.
I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?
Let's kick his ass.
Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest.
But my name's not...
What's that?
I work at Dennis Brothers Fish Supply.
Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.
Look who I've found!
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
grabs Pauline by the shoulders.
snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.
What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
All right! You go out there and get a job and you damn well pay your own way!
stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.
turns around and Juliet presents her with a brown paper bag.
Oh! I'll pop them in a bowl.
It doesn't matter.
Daddy says the Bible's a load of bunkum!
What??
Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.
That's great! We'll have the fare in no time!
Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
The way you just looked at me...
Eighty third most common.
Pitbull attacks.
I did more then that.
Since what?
Someone special.
Have we met?
The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
Where's my wife?
For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally.
Two.
This game is over do you hear me?
But that's what I need. To be sure... to be absolutely sure...
You can trust me. Your wife is dead and you need to move past that. And the only way to move past something completely is to go straight through it, not around it. Surrender yourself to your wife's death. Let it chew you up and spit you back out on the other side. It's the only way you can become whole again.
I surrender...
I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp out in the woods.  I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up.
Hey, do I look crazy?  I don't go for that shit... interviews, media. They're manipulators.  "Keep a low profile," that's my motto.
In private.  They got cameras and alla that crap in there. Microphones.
Well, we gotta work this thing out, John.  It's a goddamn mess an' I'm halfway to doing serious time in the joint an' the TV lady's so stuck on you she don't want it to come out you stole her purse because it might break the heart of millions.  Looka those maniacs, willya?  They love you, for Chrissake!
I got your bail continued.
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
Twenty-five grand is peanuts!  All you gotta do is get me outta here long enough to collect.
You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?
I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance...
TAXI!  HEY, TAXI!  Well, at least I'm gonna get my goddamn million bucks.  TAXI FOR CHRISSAKE!
You couldn't have a problem, Chick, because I personally have got them all.  I cornered the whole goddamn market.  You wouldn't believe... Oh, how ya doin'...?
It's never your fault, Bernie! Never ever!  You screwed up my life, now you're gonna screw up Joey's life, but you're never gonna accept responsibility for anyth--
He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.
-- saved your...  whaaaaaaat?  What? Blackmailing...?
Lie, you mean...
I'm working on that.  It's just I got some business problems and... whatsa matter?
I could go to a movie Thursday night.  'Cause we don't have school on Friday.
All the adulation?  It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?
You're a celebrity, John.  People are going to want to please you... or use you... or both.
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
Apparently the guy who pulled you out wasn't a passenger...
A "mystery guy!"  "Not a passenger." Who?
Said he's not an actor.
I... I saw him out the window.
Never reach out!
An hour after...!  Deak, for Heaven's sake!  Let's give her a night in New York City.  We'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel...
Reporters don't have hormones?
Call him back.  Ask him.  I'm a little...busy.
Where are these toys of yours?
All right then.  That's important, isn't it?  -- For you to be in an "up" environment.  I'm saying you should literally take that as your <u>base</u>, do you know what I mean? It's something positive that you've accomplished -- even if you were forced by circumstance -- something for you to build upon.
Right.
The whole disapproval thing.  If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you?  -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.
Yeah, I've always been able to make my way in the world.  I don't like having to rely on other people.
"We don't want to be late for our first day of school."
Mom, I heard someone downstairs!
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
Honey, nobody buys a house overnight -- if someone else comes back at them, well, we might have to make a counter offer.  But we can't look too eager or we'll get screwed.
It's very nice, but it's still a little pricey for us.
Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar.
I know someone else who's sensitive.
Oh, space!  -- You said the right thing.
I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?
Get on the other side of that.
Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
Even better.
Parker.  We found him knocked out in the can.
You can believe what you want.  You saw the tape.
Well, technically it's not mid evil - - it's Renaissance.
He had to come from somewhere.
Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
I see your point, Bedsoe, but I have to look at this from the law's point of view.  There's something missing here.  It's something I'm sure you've come across many times in your career.  It's called evidence.  Get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it.  Find me an eye witness.  Dig up a motive.  Until then we don't have a case against him.
You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
You sure?
Aye -- yet one such as I who has wandered this world for nearly nine centuries can remember back to other days of change.  Days of Robin of the Hood and Arthur Pendragon.  They were real enough once, but they drifted into men's dreams and became legend - - as we shall do one day.
Yes.
For what?
As friends -- always as friends.
If it came down to it what would you do?
She's the King's cousin.
So, you do this for yourself?  What about her?  You cannot not have a relationship, Macleod.  You've told me of your wife, Heather, and how you loved her. Romeriz warned you then, but you would not listen.  You watched her grow old and die -- and there was nothing you could do.
The only thing you can do.  You must end it.
I lied.
Where I'm going you cannot follow.
Huge.
I was wondering if I could talk to you?
Yes.  We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.
In the highlands?
He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
It's mine.  It's been in my family for years.  It belonged to my great, great, great grandmother.
Because it's my name.
Then who's Russell Nash?
Meet me Tratino's at nine.
A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
--the Calan.  Do you know who they are?
On the back it has--
Then we shouldn't break into the cavern until tomorrow morning.  This could be a very important find.  I want it documented.
His head.  Someone cut it off.
I don't think it is a duplication.
It's not been long enough.  What witchcraft is this?
The Kurgan was a pussy.
I know.
Yes.
I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--
My dreams died long ago.
I can take care of myself.
Yes, sir.  But what about the disks?  If the cops end up with the disks, we're gonna see a whole lot of heat.
The best.
I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.
It's happening right now.
Don't go Rambo and you'll tell'm about this on the back nine.  I'm gonna tie you up, then we're gonna take your car.
I didn't know he would have a gun!  It just went off!
What if he's dead?  What if you killed him?
We're on foot.  We can't get away.
We're surrounded by houses, dumbass. Every house has a car in the garage. All we have to do is take one.
I'm not going to die for this!
The Bristo Police Department.  Look out the window.  You see the car?
Dennis?  I want you to release those people.
What?
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
Only if you try to grab me.  We could've shot you from the wall.
My father.
<u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!
Find something, Kevin.  Don't just stand there.  And tie this bastard, too.  I don't want him waking up and goin' Rambo on us.
That would be Mars Krupchek.  Jesus, he works for me, too.
It won't be a problem.
An hour, tops.  Might be sooner.
Where is it?
You sure?
I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it.
Whatever.
Yes.
Keep your head down.
I need to talk to him.  Alone.
We only have eight officers on duty, Chief.
She didn't answer.
Maddox!  You got that?
-- then when you get him, you damn near assault the man in the ambulance!  <u>What</u> <u>is going on</u>?
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.
Contact the landlord.  I want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy.
Special Agent Jones.
They've been in there all day.
How about you and your sister?
They nailed the windows.  I can't get'm open.
If I try to climb out they'll see me on the security cameras.  They would see you outside, too --
How do I reach him?
We want them.  You will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks.
Smith will know.
We, who is we?
How much?
Name a price.
Six.
I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside.
Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
Excuse me, Colonel.
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
Will you protect us.
Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you.  Your cellar is well-stocked, right?
Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily.
I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one.
They can go where they want. They are in charge now.
I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
Listen, you need me.
If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
I will do nothing unless you help me now.
At least.
You’re drunk.
Good. I'd like to book a massage.
Please, except my humblest apologies...
Don't worry. I have a job this morning. I must go to visit my good friend George Rutagunda. You know George?
The guest list. It hasn't been updated since the murder of the president.
I need a great favor.
I will give you my house.
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.
We can't wait. We all go together or not at all.
I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
Homework?
I couldn't help.
You could have asked for a favor.
They do not have your connections.
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
Where are you hurt, son?
What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
What!
Go out! Where?
Yes, when you worked as the nurse.
Why?
Tell me what it was.
A car.
A Volkswagen.
Please, please try one more time.
We wait until 7:00. If he is not here with the twins he is not coming. We leave. That was your promise. Go help the children.
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
What's wrong?
That is why they call it coach?
Boss, some of those men are my neighbors, they know I'm Tutsi.
Let us remember this night and tell the world that even in hell there are good people.
As the trucks go.
I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all.
The staff, the guests.
The staff and guests! How many?
Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
Go downstairs, I will help you.
If that's the fact, Price, okay, you've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --
-- the whole thing is falling apart!
I got an engraved -- literally -- invitation -- with my name --
-- she's not dead! Just have to get her heart pumping aqain!
Running all the bells and whistles we set up to scare hell out of everybody --
What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...?
What?
Up here --
-- yeah, we did that --
-- that's the fact, bud --
-- where the hell were you?
-- listen to the man --
Oh, I think we're going to have several.
Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.
Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.
Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The "O.J." knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your "Jim Jones Kool- Aid" that was exactly that?
You're hurting me.
My guests were shredded. It's your sick little scene now, Steven: enjoy. I'm going to go run scalding water on the places you just touched me, and then I'm calling a cab.
Really? Well, let it rip.
A simple leak, if it's okay with you.
Steven??
You didn't think to ask?
I've designed and built six of these places -- take my word for it, everything's fine.
What?
I am.
-- no -- that's when everything went ragtime -- whoever else is in this house has been doing everything since -- I thought it was Evelyn --
Evelyn, go stir your cauldron or something for a sec.
-- it wasn't me.
Believe me, we need to.
Pritchett, what is this "core of darkness"?
How, he's supposed to be dead!
What's the matter?
I'm sorry.
There's no need to be.
Sure.
Yes.
She's hiding.
He's blessing the house.
Aubrey run! Aubrey stares in horror at Maura - just then the knife FADES AWAY as Maura rolls over, returned to normal -
Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here...
What will Aubrey think?
Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
Ok.
Were you fooling with the power?
Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy after all.
I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
You seem to appreciate the local scenery.
What?
It was a shame.
I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
There's something through that wall!
Well what is it!
He'll do what he does best.  But he'll do it unfettered.  He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering.
The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...
No.  No.  It's fine.  Come now.  I was having bad dreams anyway.
Right.
Your dream.  You said you were having a bad dream.
It's Saturday morning.  Let's go shopping.
What else came with it?  Anything still here?
You gonna buy?
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
No.  Thank you.
Good.  So did I.  And that's all ...
What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you?
But how in God's name ...
You're apologizing?
I miss you too.
Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
A girl?  Anyone I should know?
Hudson, God's given you a gift for cat burglary, you can t just...
Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me."
Three minutes, 51 seconds.
Oh man, you still got a thing for those unmasculine European coffees? Who's your buddy?
Hey, get this irritable guy a cappuccino.  I gotta go be a boss.
Rutherford Auction... that name...
What am I doing here?  There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy.
Why try?
I don't want to sound immature, but we were here first...
Last rites, sister?
Sorry.  Seventeen Hail Marys and five minutes outside.
I'll bring my entire repertoire...
Wow, you were "in the joint." "Doing hard time."  It's funny, but that excites me.  I seem to have a thing for sinners.
Oh.  No.
It's from the machine.  All they need is the crystal to run it and they have 2/3 of it already.  We can't let that happen.
Actually he never told us what it was.
That's two hundred dollars a day? So he can get a hooker and some tequila.  Veto, Darwin.
Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones.  But now finally I got my new goal.  World domination.  With your help...Bunny....quit that!
We're here to say, your government was right.
What job?
The only thing you can't do is get sex for free.  I know I was in prison for like basically the 80's, but, call me daffy, aren't you supposed to <u>stop</u> me from committing crimes.  You know, Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup, Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute.
If you think you're getting past me...
I used you as a diversion.  while you were getting captured upstairs, I was shredding documents in the basement.  Deep down, I guess I was just jealous.  You were one incredible thief...
Tell me about it...
He didn't look unhappy!
Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. There's no point in looking back. At the time, Stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock -- then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap --
That smart?!
Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
At any rate I arrived in town not ten days ago, full of dreams and aspirations, anxious to make my way in the world --
Mind if I join you?
Don't bother to thank me, it's the easiest thing in the world. Matter of fact, I know where a vacancy just came up.
Well, can I at least call you deer? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma' -- the great circle of life, death and rebirth.
We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker --
Now, Aim --
Phony, huh?
I filed it yesterday.
I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
It's about a dimwitted editor who --
Terrific.
This you're familia' with.
I like to think so! It's this little idea I been working on!
Nobody wants a hare-brained product like this! Ya see, Buzz, it lacks the creative spark, the unalloyed genius that made, uh...
And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here --
And Sid says you stole it!
It's sittin' in your apron pocket, right where you left it. Imbecile.
Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.
Disappointment? J'etais destroyee! I was in bed for a week! Positively sick with fury! I called in the gardener and said, 'Monsieur Gonzalez, either those azaleas come up next spring or you are terminee!
Hmmm.
You're fired.
Well... I'm for it...
Ya don't say.
Fah from it...
She is!
They even cure nonsense, Miss Betsy.  Mama Rose was mindless.  I was at the Houmfort when the Houngan brought her mind back.
Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?
So -- he says I'm nice.  He's a nice boy, too, Miss Connell, a very nice boy.  But I'm worried about his drinking.
But you didn't have to come up here.
Perhaps not.  But I did come here and I found it was so simple to let the gods speak through me. Once started, it seemed such an easy way to do good.  I should have known there was no easy way to do good, Betsy.
I've never heard of a cure.
Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.
Ah, yes, our Paul, strong and silent and very sad -- quite the Byronic character. Perhaps I ought to cultivate it.
It's my day off.
But what in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian?
I'm a nurse.  I always watch people when they pour something.  I watched Ti-Joseph and it was exactly two ounces.
That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.
Not to a nurse.  Sleep is a cure.
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
Mrs. Holland must have been beautiful ---
Good morning.
Wesley can be very entertaining.
I'm afraid the decanter will have to stay where it is.  I engaged you, Miss Connell, to take care of my wife, not my brother.
And instead,  I came -- bringing you nothing.
You have deliberately endangered Mrs. Holland's life.  There's no telling what you may have started with this insanity.  Why did you do it?
You know why.  You saw it the other night at the piano.  You turned away from me.
I have no defense.  So far as I know -- it is true.
Ah -- that's where reason took hold.
Two things had happened, Mrs. Rand. One was that your daughter-in-law had been taken ill with a fever. The other thing -- completely disconnected -- was that you had wished her ill, because she had hurt your sons.
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?
I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?
I do. I'm -- are you...?
Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.
I have no idea.
What's on your mind? Don't --
Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again --
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we'll be right back, Dot.
Well?
I'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. That's not why we're here, right? We're simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that --
Ben.
The phone's out.
Yeah. Well, we can just --
Lab experiments? Right smart guy -- Paul, you know your mother's gonna be disappointed not to see more of you -- In fact, let me make this more than a simple request guy, I think you should...
Hnnn.
Stay out of trouble.
After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one?
Damn right, but where the hell were you?
What?
If I were a fascist I would have sent you to one of those Southern military academies a long time ago. Now get to bed.
Good night kiddo.
Jesus all right enough!
I mean, he's not serious, he'll end up living off Janey and Jim, you watch. It's just that you develop a sense when you get older, if things are going to work out or if they won't, and sometimes it's not worth the mess...
And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
You know, dah--
But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I mean really hated each --
That's besides the point. The point is if I'd had any sense in me I'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 --
Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --
I thought I'd start trying. If you don't mind. But I am going to Florida and I do have a new nurse.
Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other --
I suppose we'll make an appearance.
Well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen --
You're not a psycho!
What sort of problems are you planning exactly?
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
Where you going?
Moisture! Moisture!
One for you and one for me.
Hey, it's a sellable skill.
Yeah but you don't even know me really.
And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets.
Geometry?
Sure, anything but this English.
What are you doing?
They left it in the jungle.
Vodka?
Huh?
That's the name for when you wake up and find this little pool of sticky stuff, like after a sexy dream.
About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
Actually...
It's all about the small stuff.  Small lies.  Small mistakes.  Small oversights. People give themselves away in a traffic violation just as much as they do in a murder case.  It's human nature.
Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in.
Isn't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop?  A good cop can't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing.  A bad cop can't sleep 'cause his conscience won't let him.  You said that once, remember?
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
I told her to come.
Seven years.
You know my plan of action.
No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
That's not what he thinks.
What did he look like?
But she was seeing someone else on the side.
She didn't tell me.
Good to see you, too, Randy.
Must be tough for you.  What happened.
Long as it's fun.
I said you're going to get a phone call.
I was a mentor to her.
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
Told you I could write an ending.
No.
Then there is nothing.
If you say so. You are innocent.
But you asked the wrong questions. Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? How quickly they perish of their own will.
Louis, I can't save her. I will only risk losing you -
And yet you knew what I would o.
Yes, cherie, of course you want more. And I'll show you how to get it. You drink from morals, my beauty, but from me? Never again.
Yes you are, my dearest. You are mine and Louis' daughter. You see Louis was going to leave us. He was going to go away. But now he's not. He's going to stay and make you happy.
Not you my dear.
Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death.
He'll never let us go.
Don't mock, Claudia...
Yes.
No. She's frightened. She doesn't know where she is.
That's not so.
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
I want it!
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
You asked for death. I didn't promise it -
Sure...
The sun will destroy the blood I've given you. Every tissue, every vein. The fire in this lantern could do that too.
I don't know any hell -
Vampires are killers. Predators, who's all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment.
That and more.
Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our little daughter?
It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you...
And the more you tried, the more I wanted you... a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart. And how you suffered... I need your forgiveness, Louis.
I'm a vampire.
Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.
Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...
You loved your wife, surely.
You need a new passion, Louis, a new reason to feel... what a story you've told, you don't understand yourself.
Yes...
Yes!
Is that bad?
Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.
No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time.
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
No.
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
Then, don't.
Yes.
Yes.
We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.
No, you're not.
Yeah.
Ben Willis.
I'm sorry.
I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.
Deep breaths --
No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.
I guess so.
Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical!
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
Baby, I finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin' hair care.
Well, I'm in school and --
How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
Excuse me, but this island didn't have a murder rate until you people showed up.  I've never seen a dead body before.
You don't have to be a jerk.
And do what with it?
Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.
This was the temple of Hades --the God of the Dead. It contained no images -- just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry.
In case you do so, would you --
Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
I have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say, I believe everything, a little.
I just came to see if your prayer would entertain me as much as my medicine seems to amuse you.
Maybe you're right. Help me get something to carry her downstairs.
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
No, that's Thea's bed. Miss Wollsten's bed is in there.
I do not know him, but I have seen him.
When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
It was, the plague
Didn't you? But now -- what are you thinking now?
Would you care to explain what you're talking about?
You've been playing on the superstitions of that poor old man — — working at him — — turning him against Thea.
If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
Theodosia.
I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at Nukden, Port Arthur.  What do you expect after a battle?
Better no general than one carrying the plague.
Dr. Drossos will tell us. We will know what to do then.
And I'm your friend —— but that doesn't explain why you are always trying to come between Thea and me?
I don't know. Everything's so mixed up --
Why in the world can't you?
He hates all my race.
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
The groom, idiot. Come on, get that ladder.
Ernie, I'm a rich tourist today. How about driving me home in style?
Bert, what's happened to this house? Where's Mary? Where's my kids?
Carter –– bank examiner.
Well . . .  . . . now, come right in here, Mr. Carter.
Ridiculous of you to think of killing yourself for money. Eight thousand dollars.
Oh, I've got to earn them, and you'll help me, won't you?
Now look, you mustn't talk like that. I won't get my wings with that attitude. You just don't know all that you've done. If it hadn't been for you . . .
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow –– you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
What do you mean, I wasn't there? I remember distinctly . . .
No, of course not.
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
Yes, George?
Thanks.
Looks like we'll have to send someone down –– a lot of people are asking for help for a man named George Bailey.
Fine.
I see, a flying carpet, huh? I don't suppose you'd like this old second-hand job, would you?
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.
Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
Oh, George.
I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
I thought when we put him on the Board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.
Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
How's that?
Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.
Hello, what am I bid?
Hello, Vi.
Oh, I'll probably end up down at the library.
Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
Have you put any real pressure on those people of yours to pay those mortgages?
I see. I've suddenly become quite important. What kind of security would I have, George? Have you got any stocks?
Uh-huh.
Too young or too old?
In that place?
Uh-huh.
Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful, Mary. I know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that. I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm going to see the world. Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum. Then I'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know . . . and then I'm going to build things. I'm gonna build air fields. I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. I'm gonna build bridges a mile long . . .
Where'd you get that dress?
Do you like it?
I feel like a bootlegger's wife.  Look!
Darling, you're wonderful.
Hi.
Yeah, just started.
Where's your coat and hat?
George, darling! Where have you been?
Oh, shucks . . .
How fast is enough?
We'll take your supercargo.
What the hell, we're steering for it.
It's okay, it's okay.  What's the matter?  Tina?  Honey?  Hey ---
It's still there!
I just made it up.  It means, "Get me out of there."  What the hell's that?
Diver's camera.  Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
Sailing?
Every day?
Pop.  I'm sorry.
Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.
Heck of a way to treat a taxpayer.  Don't you have any pull with the chief, here?
Look -- I just got this from Phil Fogarty.  It was in the camera belonging to the missing divers. It proves I was right, all along.
Is that what it is?  Dollars? Money?  I'll pay for it.  Take it out of my salary.
Come on, let's check the bite radius.
What shark?
That's it.
Okay, so that's it.
Late.
Mrs. Silvera.
Use the little brush there.  Why were you at Santos'?
Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
Oh.  Want to talk about it?
Are you going to be able to sleep?
Yeah.   I think so.  Mike!  Keep it down, for chrissake!
That you were fired.
Fired me!  I'm not a hysterical man.  I'm responsible.  I know what I saw....
Very impressive ceremony.  Good speech.
Thank you, thank you.  You know my son, don't you?
We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone.
Larry, I don't know how to say this, but I think we got a shark problem. A real one.
We have to do something.
Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....
Two of them are still missing!
Go ahead, whatever it's worth.
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
That's it?
That's it.  Just do it, all right?
If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!
Affirmative, affirmative.  Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port.  I heard you.  Patrol out.
When?
I want you to meet my cousin.
Maybe.
None at all.  I wonder what the Brebner twins are doing tomorrow night.
They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started.
It'll be fun, come on!
Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the town beach....
No way.  Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so.
I can go out if I want to.
Your ass I will.  Besides, the wind's turning with the tide. Sailing back is going to be a bitch.
Anyone want to go the lighthouse?
Eat Cheerios.
No.
Quiet!  Shhh!
Michael....
I'm not in the way.  Andy, am I in the way?
He thought he had a good reason.
So?  So?
So it can't be done like that.  The man's a menace, plain and simple.
Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
Pre-opening jitters.
Okay, bye.
How come?
Yeah, you really don't like him.
We play hide and seek all the time.  They find a lot of things.
Nothing.
That we swim.
Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.
Why?  'Cause they're hungrier?
No.
Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.
... Mean through the tubes?
It's a shark's tooth!
But you --
Wait a minute.  These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton.  They're dolphins.
I'm sorry.
That's preposterous!
Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
Why are you?
The grenade's just to intimidate Whitey.  He knows I have it, so he watches out.  Same is true when I film lions, tigers, rhinos...
Don't blame yourself.
... Massachussettans aren't.
Why you sonuvabitch...
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
Goes up.
What, hon?
SEAN!
Hold still, damn it!
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!
Gotta sneeze.
What the hell's there?
Polar bears.
... I'll go to McDonalds.
That's Dad...
Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas.  In one of those chapels.  He can meet us there.
Give me a 400-foot magazine;  we may be down there for a while.
I wouldn't mind going down with her.
They're at the beach....
Where is she?
Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?
Whatever happens next.....
Part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't...I don't know why he wants me....
I don't know what he thinks...I don't know what I think...I don't even know why I'm talking about it...  It's silly...I'm getting too old for this sort of thing....
That....
Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
It picked Sean...It killed your father....
Dad died from a heart attack....
I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
I don't want to talk about that.
I'm the captain of this majestic ship.  It goes where I take it....
Mostly it feels like driving.  You digging for buried treasure?
Doesn't matter....
Sure you can....
I don't know how....
You're impossible....
Get her started....
Tell Thea I'm sorry....
Tricky little devils, aren't they? How's the degree doing?
How's Ellen?
It was like having snow in the house ...Jesus, I miss them.
Maybe it's the tags that suck....
I stuck them on, man....
Where the hell's the beer...?
Money is money....
We got it together, Jake....
How long have you known Hoagie?
Nothing.. But stay within a quarter mile...I've got a three-mile radius on the monitor.  If he comes back I'll hear him.  You'll have time to get up.
You fall off a horse, you get right back on or you don't ride again....
I didn't ask you to....
How come only me?
Maybe he only likes white meat....
Don't flatter yourself.... 
I'm not going to marry you until you straighten out your life and your hair.
I'd have to manage a nookie parlor to do that....
We're out of decaf...We're out of petty cash...And we're out of requisition forms....
Anything to do before I go home?
Gone to Ben Masters' place.  Cow tipping.
Claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows.  They're not giving milk.
What d'you mean, I just opened it for you? This is <u>French</u> champagne.
I already did. What's his problem?
Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something?
Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump ..
It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs?
No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day.
He didn't shoot it, Ross. And no way by accident. There's a flash-burn. It was point-blank.
Just makes to so God damned mad ..
I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
You don't really believe this?
No .. You didn't know that ..
I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..
What d'you mean, "bits."
We're not <u>here</u>. I don't want the desk to hear us ..
Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. See these striations right here?  It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something?
Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
We have a body part in suspicious circumstances - a tailor's dummy wearing a brassiere - <u>and a bill</u> <u>for seventeen dollars for its wig</u>!
I'm talking, outside the girl?
I may have said some- thing. I don't recall.
<u>If</u>, your friend from San Diego was up here, and thought for <u>one</u> out of <u>two fucken seconds</u>, she was a danger to him, he'da taken her out weeks ago ..
You <u>haven't</u>. And you got no voice in here, Taylor, <u>so keep it shut</u>.
Lotta scratch-marks on your door?
Hamlet. Have you read it?
No.
No, Wordsworth .. Do you like poetry?
No, I don't pray .. Had a dream once, about God, just around the time I was getting well .. He was a nasty lookin little guy, moved into the apartment right on topa me .. I said, don't you listen to people's prayers?  He said, prayers? Not often. They're Junk Mail.
Alright, I'm worried about Christmas. I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..
Then why didn't he kill me?
I know about alcohol, John.
I wanna be near you ...
Wasn't frozen, was it, Sergeant?
Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
I'm here, honey. I'm right here.
Even better.
A derelict.
I know about the bachelor party.
One of the accountants.
Well, no you didn't --
Could you just stop moving?
It's not "love me."  It's not "trust my handshake."  It's make the sale. Get it signed.  There shouldn't be "confusion" about that.
I'm not trying to make history. _ 67.
Oh come on --
Oh, tell the story.
I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
Hello?
Happy for us.
Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
Good evening.
Plus, you could use that commission.
You don't have to explain.
Yeah, what happened there.
Bye you guys. _ 88.
Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.
I don't need you to "stick."
I don't know --
Aw, shut up.  You had me at hello. _ 130.
No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
Thank you.
But you just gotta hear me out on one thing.  You're very responsible with Ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.
Good.
That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling?  I mean, he must have been needing that.
-- well, Rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. He says that your deal memo has been signed by the Arizona Cardinals. Four years for ten-point-two million dollars.  Playing in the state where you grew up.
It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready?
Here it is.  "Show me the money."  Show.  Me.  The.  Money. _ 36.
Very much.
You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
Don't you even see -- I'm finished. I'm fucked. Twenty-four hours ago, I was hot. Now... I'm a cautionary tale!
Fine.
Rod, get on the camel.
You know when you know.  It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?
I'm worried too.  I'm worried that the only reason I'm here getting my brains blown loose is that you weren't asshole enough to get my ten million three months ago.
No, I'm going to answer you.  You want an answer?  I'll give it to you.  Loyalty.  She was loyal.  Everything grew from there.
For loyalty, you buy a dog.  For love, you get married.
Where'd you find the perfect white shirt?
Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.
Gorgeous.
To the pools?
Jerry.  You two will be together forever.
Jerry, Rod is very very upset. Tyson, no!
I'm fine.  What's up?
You did this to yourself.  You said "fewer clients."  You put it all on paper.  Scully was very upset.  Heart attacks make some people sweeter, but not him.  You did this to yourself --
Okay.  I've been hogging it. You're right.  _ 76.
A lot.  We got a big fax today... we need this commission, buddy.
That's why they cheer, you know. The white man sending the black man into battle...
He says it's a bad idea!
What did you say?
I filmed this the morning they left.
Eric!
That one time was just the bumper.
How low?
Where is it?
Sure.
Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment.
It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
The bones will be there when we get back. That's the nice thing about them. They never run away.  And besides, you got me into this. I don't intend to be alone with these people.
I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES!
Sorry, Alan it's been six years.
I dunno. I mean, it was kind of preachy. Chaos-this, chaos-that. And like, to me, the guy seemed kind of high on himself.
Closer you get to the water, the bigger things get.
Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government.
There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The "plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like that.
Stan.
You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?
You are an academic.
It doesn't matter what I think.
When you have a lot of time to think, it's funny who you remember.  It's the people who challenged you.  It is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning.  I never told you how sorry I was about what happened after we returned.
We've got to see one to find out. Is there any --
This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.
Where does it say that?
What?  Why?
Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down.
Piss.
It's just fed.  It won't attack unless it's threatened.  Don't move.
Our chance to do what?
You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.  And they asked him, "why did you go up there to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I went up there to live."
It's called self-testing.  But in your case, it sounds more like self-destruction.  A uniquely human characteristic.  In fact, human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase.  Maybe death and destruction are our job, maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that-
Maybe.  Maybe not.
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
I'm trying!
Rotten luck, this storm.  Get my grandchildren on the radio will you?  I don't want them to worry about a wee bit of rain.
I will not do it.  You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not.
I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
Uh - - about two million.
There's only one way to be positive.  I need to see some droppings.  I have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
I'm sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I'm in a hurry. Will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then?
Oh my God.
But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.
Control?!  You never had control!  I was overwhelmed by the power of this place.  So I made a mistake too.  I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now.  You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John, there's nothing worth picking up.  The only thing that matters now are the people we love.  Alan, Lex, and Tim.  And John, they're out there where people are dying - - people are dying, you know?
Why?
Anything else, you old fossil?
- - totally incidental  unrelated to the feeding pattern - -
You can't hold it by yourself!
The fences are electrified, right?
What's that?
We'll discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.  You just take me through this step by step.  I'm on channel two.
It changed.  Why?  Okay, back over your wrist.  Because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -
- - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -
Alan?
Please - - chance it.
People were gettin' bloody noses - - things on your head - - aneurisms - -
Forty-eight hours from now, I'll be accepting your apologies.  Now get out of the way.  So I can see them!
It's just like coming out of a tree house.  Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?
This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
The kids okay?
Kids get scared.
I didn't say you were scared.
For today, I guarantee it.
John Hammond.  And I am delighted to finally meet you in person Dr Grant.
- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!
I'm coming up there Tim! I'm coming to get you!  Lex, I've got to get him!
Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
John, John.
There's nothing that great about discovery.  What's so great about discovery?  It's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores.  What you call discovery I call the rape of the natural world!
You're all right, John You're okay.  It's just you don't have intelligence.  You have "thinktelligence."  You think narrowly and call it "being focused."  You don't see the consequences.  You're very good at solving problems, at getting answers - - but you just don't know the right questions.
Wait a minute?  What do you mean "worked"?  Everything is still off!
There's no sign of him anywhere.
Turn it off, Lex!  Turn it off!
They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals.  And these are herbivores.
No, but...
That's not true...
I don't think you're getting in the spirit of things, Janet. We'll buy whatever studies we need --
I want to look at the rest of the house.
Who is this? What's going on?
Janet, goddamnit, what's going on?
Fuck you.
_Krueger_...
Who's chest?
I think it's our best bet. They're taking apart his house right now... they found weapons, blood, a mountain of evidence. We can't say he was framed.
I don't know if anything's going to work in this case. Therefore, we have to try everything.
This is a legitimate cinematic genre. Just like Westerns, Comedies, Film Noire, Science Fiction...
One of the deputies is pretty cute. I think she likes me.
Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.
The mother said the boy hadn't slept for over three _months_. A physical examination showed dilated pupils, temperature of one-oh-two, blood chemistry highly imbalanced...
It's a neurological disorder affecting the hypothalamus. The part of the brain that causes sleepiness is inactive. They didn't know about it back in the sixties. Even now, it's not understood very well.
We're going to need at least two full REM cycles to get a clear neurological profile. Three hours minimum, six hours ideal.
Me too. I'm drunk.
Fascinating.
Now.... according to the file, Krueger was burned to death in a fire in 1968. But get this -- beginning in 1984, there was _another_ series of murders in Springwood. All teenagers... all killed in their sleep... all killed with finger blades just like Krueger's.
Not yet.
Great.	When can you do it?
Alone... but with a murderous fury inside him... which led him to kill dozens of people.
Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.
Then we're all in a lot of trouble.
If I give you a bigger dose, it'll give you a heart attack.
My client... is dead.  But I think he's a free man.
You have been hearing the sordid side then.
Up there.
Yes -- that's us.
Did you?
Where do you get your ideas?  Only joking -- I'm just joking.  Let's go to a brothel then, Kafka, come on.
What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?
Not a chance.  I'm the thinnest person I know.
Then its authority is in doubt.
I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
He has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
You might find a more athletic hobby -- put some color in your cheeks.
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
When I have no reason to doubt.
The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.
Tonight?
Burgel hated Eduard.  And me.  I'm sure he knew about us -- and I'm sure it drove him mad.
I knew you walked this way to work.  I wanted to find you before they did.
Wednesday.  We left the office together.
Your office is the Workmen's --
Eight -- and seven months.
Can I ask -- how you found me?
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
She's missing.  I went to her house and she hadn't returned there.
It's all right to be sarcastic in private to us -- because we have a sense of humor -- but when we're up at the Castle we suggest you don't make a fuss.  It would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects.
That's obvious, isn't it?  We have an opening for a new member.
You must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in.  It wouldn't have been so bad, but even the Medical Officer for the district was killed!
I did read that.  They gave him a posthumous medal.
This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?
We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.
Take your filthy paws off him -you ignorant pig!
Do they have him on display at the weekends?
No!
I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
Relax ... it was fifteen years ago. I don't do it now.
We're leaving.
Two... maybe three.
Oh my God ... Ann?
A man eater! Fantastic!  Making history, Herb
) They are now.
Yeah? ... Well, I gave 'em a taste of American lead ... and I don't see 'em coming back for seconds!
Oh you've got to. He does such fun things with imagery. And I've been reading The Fall --  -- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo -- it's the same thing, you know the imagery --
Do you always have to repeat?
Well I have to close up now.
We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.
I guess he figured it was better.
Grunemann? I've looked at him a --
Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?
Gee.
Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --  Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he --
OK.
I don't want you to look up. There's someone on the skylight.
I don't see anything, do you?
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
It got lonely upstairs. There's someone on the roof.
Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do you really like other kicks? Is it more just having power over someone? -- so you don't really need to --
You could help me find her. You know the people.  I'll pay you a hundred dollars.
Why?
Because I didn't want to be touched! I didn't think you'd get that!
Oh.  Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.
Doesn't scare me. I think we could handle it.
I'm on my way to Chicago. Very important meeting tonight. Well -- any new developments?
Yeah, two things Pete, that --
Yeah. It wasn't Tom.
No. No mistake Pete. It doesn't prove who it was -- but proves it wasn't Tom.
No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.
Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.
I wanted to give it to you first.
Goodbye, Pete.
She told me.
I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
Did she talk about him to you?
We grew up together. Kids.
No.
Everybody's got some, I guess.
Oh, yes.  Won't you come in.
He's in his room, playing.
The prospect of losing my child.
Very well, I'd like to see him if I may.
My daddy doesn't hit me, silly. Why would my daddy hit me?
Ladies and gentlemen...
The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. Where is mommy?
That's right.  You're absolutely right...It's been a long time since I made French toast.
Sorry.
All it is is onions and gravy.
Some of the brown stuff is still there.
Then eat around it.
Are you...gonna go...away?
See you in the morning light...
Sure.
Sure.  Lots of times.
What did you do when you were little?
Yeah, there was apple juice.
I don't understand, daddy.
Overruled.  The witness will answer, please.
Yes.  I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.
Objection!
And did you have a close personal relationship?
It was good.  He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler.
Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?
No.
No.
More than three, less than thirty- three--permanently?
Then, we don't really know, do we, when you say "permanently" if you're planning to remain in New York, or even to keep the child for that matter, since you've never really done anything in your life that was continuing, stable, that could be regarded as permanent.
I suppose...
Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you.
I consider it less my failure than his.
Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry.
I want my son.  I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son.
Joanna, go fuck yourself!
Me?  I've never been better. I mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine.
Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay?  But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.  Just until you get yourself straightened out.
Well, ah...I thought it over and I decided we're doing it Murray's way.
Jim, this is garbage.  This isn't anything like what we talked to Revlon about.  None of it. You can't--
No.  No, I don't believe it. Jim O'Connor would never let anything like that happen.  He gave me my shot in this business. If it wasn't for Jim O'Connor I'd be--I don't know where I'd be. He's a wonderful man...
Kramer, I'm sorry.  All I was trying to do was--
Kramer...There's something I ought to tell you.
I've been offered a job in Washington with H.E.W.
I'm going to take it.
Oh, Christ.. .John, there's some- thing I ought to tell you.  My... ah, situation has...changed.  I lost my job.
Any prospects?
I don't know.
She's the mother.  That means she's within her legal rights.
I mean...things.  Ted, Joanna's very unhappy and--
Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being I have ever met.  No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps.
Lenox Hill.  77th Street between Park and Lex.  The emergency number is 327-0800.
What d'you tell her?
Me?!  You want me to take care of Billy?!
Any day.
Maybe.  I said maybe.  What I mean is, ah...I don't think it'll really work out, but Charley seems to want it, so...
Ted, I just heard...
Yes, Holiness.
Hmmm.
You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
The People's Liberation Army pays for all food and lodging.
All?
He is a capable man.
General Chiang Chin-wu, the Chinese representative, is en route to Dromo. He is coming to meet you.
At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.
Two.
So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
Can India help us?
Britain?
Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
I will alert the Chinese delegation. You know, I would never have let you go alone, Kundun.
Arrange for me to speak to the people's leaders.
Good day.
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
Thank you.
Yes, I am aware. How has your time in China been?
I have one more piece of news. A baby is coming.
He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
Is that a true story, or pretend?
True.
I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing.
The people will cry when they learn you are gone. But they would all want you safe.
I do.
Too young?
<u>No</u>, <u>I</u> <u>did</u> <u>not</u>.  The crocodile <u>did</u> kill him, though. But it was all... it was a mistake.
<u>So</u> <u>why</u> <u>are</u> <u>we</u> <u>landing</u>?  <u>Hector</u>.
They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
No crocodile has ever--
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
<u>Bite</u> <u>my</u> <u>bishop</u>.
That <u>sounds</u> good but underneath it's hurtful.  Nightcap?
I see blood.  Maybe you got him, Hank.
Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.
Are you sure?
Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.
Yes, it <u>did</u> seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it <u>worked</u>, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body.
Hank <u>says</u> he's sure.
It's too dangerous for--
Um... y'know...  Yeah.
I didn't say it like that.
Night.
<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.
Hector.
Take him.
Yeah.
White perch.
So does he.
Hector.  <u>Do</u> <u>not</u> <u>move</u>.
You too.
He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
Seconds.  Three, four.
What kind of backup do we have?
It's just that--
Gee.
We're staying in <u>tents</u>?
Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets?
I'm sorry.
What?
Kevin, hey.
It's ten after nine.
Well on this one I'd like you to be.
I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me.
It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
I love it when you talk dirty.
Not random at all, maybe. Like there's some pattern here...?
He's got a lot on his mind besides Buffalo Bill... His wife, Bella, is real sick. Comatose... I'm tellin' you about it now, 'cause he may never.
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
Good. Then you should be able to remember the rules.
I'm going to show you why we insist on such precautions... On the afternoon of July 8, 1981, he complained of chest pains and was taken to the dispensary. His mouthpiece and restraints were removed for an EKG. When the nurse bent over him, he did this to her...
Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
He's my patient! I have rights!  I'm not just some turnkey, Miss Starling. I shouldn't even be here this afternoon. I had a ticket to Holiday on Ice.
Gun. Jesus. Turn in the ID as soon as you get back. The gun, too. Be on the next plane, Starling, there's one in 90 minutes.
The market in Lecter hints is way down, today, okay? I've got two good men dead in Memphis, and three civilians. I've got -
Oh.
The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
You're qualified and available. And frankly, I can't spare a real agent right now.
Every word, Starling? Every gesture?
Sir, that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on -
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
Murdered...? How?
He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.
You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
He starts this - buzzing in me, in my head. He makes me feel violated... You used me, Mr. Crawford.
They weren't there. Get close-ups.
Raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls. And Lecter knows him. Maybe even treated him... You think so, too, don't you? Or you'd never have sent me to that asylum.
Not lately. But maybe someday.
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?  Do you think she could've had a friend you didn't know about?
"We" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect.
Mmmmm... That's rather slippery of you, Officer Starling. Sit. Please.
I didn't.
No. I only hoped that your knowledge -
What's that, Dr. Lecter?
I don't know. Is it?
By the book, he's a sadist.
Life's too slippery for books, Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from the same God.  Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was she a large girl?
Mmm. And what else...?
No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
Quid pro quo, Doctor.
I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.
The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.
Then tell me how.
No! That's incidental.
Anger, social resentment, sexual frus-
No, he covets. That's his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer.
Later, listen, I'll -
No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
I took one lamb. And I ran away, as fast as I could...
Do you think if you saved Catherine, you could make them stop...? Do you think, if Catherine lives, you won't wake up in the dark, ever again, to the screaming of the lambs? Do you...?
Goodbye, Clarice...  You looked - so very lovely today, in your blue suit.
The Latin name comes from two rivers in Hell. Your man - he drops these girls into rivers, every time. Didn't I read that?
I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure!  I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded, red men in the wild!
Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.
Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.
...never doubt what you are doing.
My letter...
Duncan...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.
No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?
Fort Edward, then?
: Only one or two loads.
Really? Do you want them to overrun all New York colony?
...No...Do not call myself much of a subject at all.
Folks here goin' to join in that fight?
Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east side of the swamp until you clear the French picket line. Head north over the ridge, then come about southeast and fork left in Little Meadow and you're free of the outpost and skirmishers...
Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?
Yes.
Heart. Give Magua new heart.
Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy... These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves.  Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British reinforcements arrive?
La victoire.
Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.
Well, how the hell does a skin rash kill you in eight hours?!
And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
Not exactly a big ocean country.
Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
Maybe they already have.
Seeing how my stock's doing...
What's wrong with it?
Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one.
And it killed Bo?
No...she killed herself.
Sounds like a good week, Beck. In fact...I put your folder in front of the Vice President of District Operations last night...
Well, suit yourself, then...its your decision...  Ha ha...a little joke...suit yourself...
Unfortunately.  We can't.
What about his suit?  That's a million five the company's got to replace.  They'll make somebody go get it.
Shhhh...don't tell no one.  Job security.
Pretty good.  He sent them out videotaping outcrop.
He didn't say it was a "routine check-up," he said it was a "routine <u>precaution</u>."
I do, man.  That's a beautiful place.  When I get out of here I'm going there.  Find a nice little snow covered chalet, warm little woman, crackling fire--
You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
He's tanking on us...
Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that stuff?...
Twelve hours!
What?  That?...I've done this one before.  You hungry?  I'm hungry.
I'm going to try to remove it.
It's had a meal.
Like a leech.
How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
Probably no longer than four weeks.
I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.
Well not exactly, no; I got 'em sitting in the car, actually; I thought we might sell them back to the Greek, but I am having a bit of a problem getting hold of him.
I still will, if you don't mind.
Let's have a butcher's. Jesus, there's lots of everything. We've got god knows how much of this stinking weed; we've got a shit load of cash; and we've got a . . . traffic warden.
I dunno, but I don't think we need him. Dump him at the lights.
No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.
Like antiques.
They were . . .
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
They were going to pay, then?
No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?
You had better be careful.
Try that one.
Out the back.
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
Hit the fuckers.
No, just one of them is in charge of them going to the job. So I assume he will still
If you think I am going to war without one, you're mistaken, mate.
I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear.
Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.
Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.
. . . What?
Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
You're not funny Tom; you're fat and look as though you should be funny, but you're not.
Tom, you're all heart.
What about all the gear?
You would take a pain ín the arse full stop.
How many wings have they got between them?
How many feet?
That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
Er, fertilizer.
I'm not talking to you. You don't have any friends.
Just shut up.
Oh, come on, Amado--
I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.
What exactly do you think your job is, Private?
Chaos.
Thank you, sir.
From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
I'm sorry, Sergeant Major. There wasn't anything I could do. Shadow gets crazy--
Yes, Sergeant.
Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated.
Skinny?
So he could have gone out to the base, hopped the fence, dug down into the dirt on the old rifle range and had a heart attack.
A .45--
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old.
Yeah, it's a pretty cold trail.
Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft hands, lateral movement--the whole package. Only a sophomore--
Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?
You look awful good in that uniform, though.
Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead.
No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?
I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.
I never met her.
Uncle Al--
He a Black man or an Indian?
So they stayed in Florida?
He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's--
I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know--
I finished that. I'm just messing around.
You own this place?
This place, the one across the street, four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of the Tires. Lots of your people rollin' back over that bridge on my rubber.
You ever know a fella named Eladio Cruz?
Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
Man's gonna retire in two years and he offer to quit. Big goddamn deal.
You know who it was they dug up?
Substance abuse?
It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
Just a shotgun, huh? Better let me take a look at that.
Aqui! [Here!]
They need help. Jaime, Anselma-- esta es mi jefa--
Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]
Tipico.
Buddy Deeds. He had a way.
King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--
That Buddy was a cool breeze.
Oh, you know, the usual troublemakers. Danny Padilla from the Sentinel, that crowd.
--Santiago.
Right.
I haven't been out here for a while.
Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
He still living?
People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.
I got an idea what happened.
You ought to put up a banner-- "Frontera, Texas: Gateway to Cut- Rate Pussy"--
Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail.
How 'bout the Sheriff?
Nobody's too busy.
Thank you.
I don't mean Fernando.
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
No. Is he sick?
I have new respect for some of my kids, meeting the parents they've been dealt--
He ever accept cash for a favor?
What do you think?
Just 'cause you went to Catholic school and wore a uniform.
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
Three months.
And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day.
Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
We haven't talked since high school.
With Paloma, it's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's never been book-smart. Had a hard time learning to read. Me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment--like a betrayal.
Pilar--
There's nothing on the walls. No pictures--
Pilar--
They got telephones.
White man just using you to keep the Black man down.
That the problem, son?  You Slow?
What's up?
We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.
Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.
You bet.
Who?
How?
My life was too weird for her.
Nope.
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
Knew what?
It was me.
I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
What is he?
Maybe he'll show you.
Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared...
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money,
I can be very persuasive.
I told you --
No.
Nothing you don't want.
Sure.
No.  I'm not going near him.
What makes you so sure?
He was a freak.  Everything he did was tainted.
I'm going back to New York in--  Shit!  I'm outta here.
Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real.
Are you a believer, then?
What for?  You need to stay busy?
You want more money, is that it?
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
Help me.
And what does Jennifer think's real?
The Puritan?
Not the Walter Wilder?
I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
Have you been in?
No.  There's only three keys. Vinovich has got one, of course.  He's a little crazy, by the way. And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise, he's a real charmer.
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
Oh yeah?
I don't know what else to do.
Will that do?  No?
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
And you believed him?
Looks that way.
In my time, and nobody else's.
You didn't try hard enough.
No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
Yes! Yes!
You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
We're looking into it Bob, but they really want you to stay to do that talk show Friday, apparently it's a really big deal, he's the Johnny Carson of Japan.
These people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it?
Bob, it's me.
Oh.
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
No.
No way.
OK, see you downstairs.
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
Yeah, you don't remember?
How old is she?
Working.
Yeah.
No.
I don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a Jazz band.
He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...
That's not what I'm talking about.
What?
When are you coming home?
Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.
It's amazing  there!
Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...
Sorry.  It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today.  Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.
I don't know.  In a way, I'm glad it all happened.
Yeah, like...
I thought the spare set was in the kitchen drawer.
I'm gonna go make a stink.  Sit tight. I'll make sure you get a change of clothes.
No, I wasn't, actually.
You heard voices, you know you did.
Given all that's happened, I understand. The world is random, but then there's faith.  Where are you in death without it?
He spoke to you?
No matter, my son, he believes in you.
Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.
You raised me, like a son.
You are my son.  Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
What do you mean "don't worry?"
Thirteen.  The last time, can you believe it?  This is how he says "Goodbye?"
On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
I think you gave me the wrong one.
Your 33rd birthday.  The transformation will be a perversion of Christ's rising from the dead.  Townsend discovered it in one of Lareaux's books.
Maya?  What do you mean?
We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
Alright, Maya.  We'll do it your way.
It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
You're referring to the defense's efforts to prove that George Viznick is tormented by "demonic voices?"
There weren't any voices.
Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.
So you can see where you're going when you crawl up his asshole.
She told me she killed them.
I won't.  I'm a lesbian.
Engaged.
You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
That's not it.
I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
Okay.
Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
Well, no, but once Nathan gets settled and the girls get a little older, it's definitely something I want to do.  Since you love to cook, maybe it's something we can talk about.
Sort of.
Then I'll get you some punch.
Uh-huh.
You could make a career by telling me where.
Get used to it, babe.
To do what you love.
Like you don't give her a hard time.
I found you someone.
This brother from my college.
Oh, great.
If you were tore up I would not be claiming you.  Trust.
They ever love you back?
She hates all freshmen.
Never let a freshman take your spot.
What's up, Sidra.
What?  You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything?
I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.
She don't know how to box, I bet.  My dad showed me how to fight like Ali.
Oh.
Shut up!
You don't look half-bad.
I can't help girls coming up to me.
I said fine.
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.
What's up?
I've been trying to find you all day.
Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?
I never asked you to choose.
You're what?
I was.  I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.
Yup.
Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
Figured it was something like that.
Thanks.
Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.
What's that supposed to be, psychology?
You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
And what happens when you lose?
Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting.
What's that, not great?
Yup.
Don't sweat it, okay.  Sooner or later the truth'll come out.
Well, tell them to mind their damn business.  You're smart enough to get a degree.
Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.
I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle.
We ain't got nothing to talk about.
So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
You want me to fuck off?
-- no,no,no what is this? who? What's this guy's name?
It is.  Can I have your home phone number with area code?
Does this sound weird?
There's no number for Frank in any of Earl's stuff and he's pretty out of it -- I mean, like I said, he's dying, y'know.  Dying of Cancer.
What kind of Cancer?
It's a helluva disease.
Thank you, Chad, and good luck to you and your mother --
It's me.  Claudia.  It's me.
I'd like to talk to you.  Your boyfriend let me in, I just knocked on the door --
I don't want you to think that I'm that way to you -- I'm not gonna call you a slut or something --
Yeah, yeah right -- what the fuck are doing?  WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE?
GET THE FUCK OUT.
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
Who was it?
It's not -- what's a 422?
You won't.  You won't have to.
Bye, bye, Claudia.
Well...is that illegal?
No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?
No, no, just casual maybe, maybe I thought -- there's a spot I like to go, it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night --
So you've done it --
No, no.
What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
What?
You really use strong language.
-- no, like what, what do you mean?
Oh my god, Jim. Jim, that was so --
What?
please, what is it, please --
Yes.
Diet Coke.
I want a shot of tequila too.
It doesn't matter.
They're here, they're fine. In the dressing room.  See you later --
It's upstairs.
Ok.
That idea is over now. We're not gonna do that now.
No school today.  My teacher got sick.
That's confidential information, little man.
I was listening --
-- and I'm through playin' games.
Fine.  Phil, you still there?
I have love all over.  I even have love for you, friend.
Well --
You talk in rhymes and riddles and ra...rub-adub --- but that doesn't mean anything to me, see....see...see I used to be smart....I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith. I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the tv --
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
I'm sick and I'm in love.
You mind your own bussines.
-- and you wanna know the common element for the entire group, like he asks...I'll tell you the answer: I'll tell you, 'cause I had that question.  I had that same question....Carbon. In pencil led, it's in the form of graphite and in coal, it's all mixed up with other impurities and in the diamond it's in hard form.  "Well...all we were asking was the common element, Donnie...but thank you for all that unnecessary knowledge...ahhh, Kids!  Full of useless thoughts, eh?"  Thank you. Thank you.  And the book says: "We may be through with the past but the past is not through with us."  And NO IT'S NOT DANGEROUS TO DO THAT.
Two years! Two years later and out of your paycheck, I never charge interest --
I've been a good worker, Solomon. A hard and loyal --
I can help you through this the best I know how but there are certain things you are gonna have to be strong about and take care of, now we can go over them, but I need to know that you're listening to me, ok?
If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
The job here is to make him as comfortable as possible -- right now -- our job is to just try and make it as painless as possible. Right?  You understand?
Get a girlfriend.
...cocksucker....
Who?
Muffy -- coffee?
Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over --
An old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill?
I'm quietly judging you.
-- fuck you.
I wouldn'tve asked --
Where does that name come from?
These Dogs'll calm down -- you just have to come in --
For six months.  I'm the day nurse...
Uh-huh.  What's going on?
I'm really sorry.
You can't just come in here.
Don't test me, you wanna talk about what the law book says, we can do that, push me far enough and I'll take you to jail -- now calm down.
I don't have to answer your questions.
What does it look like?
No I Said.
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
Been drinkin' today?
Marcie - CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN and don't do this. I want you to stay --
Did your wife find out?
I went to see her -- some fuckin' asshole answers the door in his underwear, he's fifty years old, there's coke and shit laid out on the table --
No.  No.
You feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins?  Honey, you're not on your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble --
Will that help?
Yeah.
I don't know what I've done.
You should know better.
Are you her boyfriend?
Yeah.  She's sleeping now, I mean --
I'II go....is it...back here?
It's alright.
No.  But I probably will get a call back.
What's MOW?
No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
Are you on drugs right now?
Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- Linda. Linda. Calm down.
-- that can't happen.  Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
Now you must really shut the fuck up, please. Shut The Fuck Up.
....it's alright....
Must have alot goin' on for all that stuff you got back there, eh?  You could have quite a party all that stuff....
yeah.
yeah, I said.  Is that it?
Maybe.
I'm sick of being the one, the one who always has to do everything, I don't want to be the one always --
I can't carry all of them. I need them. I need my books. I need them to go to school.
Sure.
..sorry...
It's raining frogs from the sky.
M'lady...?
Anne... The night we had together... I always wanted more.  But that one, it was enough.  Enough to make me love you forever.  I want you to remember that... and go on.  As strong as you are now.  No matter what happens.
He is your brother!
How goes that favor I asked of you?
Well here is the problem at hand: the King has ordered me to discover the identity of the Governor General of Jesuits, and kill him.  As our English rivals have left the Catholic Church, Louis has struck on a plan to dominate the whole of Europe by uniting Church and State and making himself head of both.  He has already picked the Pope.  Only the Jesuits, who put God above throne or papacy, stand in his way.
Replace the king.
You are not my priest, Aramis!  You would not be, even if I had one.
Those are the words of a broken spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and I will never believe he is my enemy.
And people close to him, who --
The King is having a ball, a masquerade ball.  It is the perfect opportunity and perhaps our only one.  At any time Phillippe could be discovered, and what then?  Remember France.  Remember the poor. Remember Raoul.  More wine!!  Where are those serving girls...?
You said you'd do anything, Athos, anything to replace this King.  So do it.
Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
But --
To the Bastille.  And death.
Phillippe, get into the boat.  Into the boat!  Now!
Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.
Can't you see I'm praying, goddammit?!
We go someplace dangerous.
At a ball, everyone watches the King!
So what?  I'd rather die covered in blood, than an old man, lying in my own piss.
Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.
Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that.
She's a woman, d'Artagnan!  From a poor family.  You may still be young enough to believe love conquers everything, but I am old and hard and I've seen too much.  Even when kings are hunchbacks they have any woman they desire, because power seduces even more than love!
Oh my friend.
An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor!
I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love you, I cannot.
What is its antidote?
Is that the king of king you wish me to be?  Or do you say this because of your son?
Porthos told me.
Let us play a game, d'Artagnan, let us pretend I am King and you are Captain of my Musketeers.  Let us behave as if my wish is law.  And my wish is to enjoy this party!
Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --
Silence!  I order you!
When he returns, watch him.  When he leaves again, you tell me.
Sire, I --
I... we are humble people...
My dear, I've already done it.
I did not want to upset you.  It was tragic.  I did everything I could for him.  I ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety, far from the fighting.  But he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger.
What do you need?
Yeah...
I'm done talking until I get a lawyer.
I don't know - but he's from the FBI.
You got any family?
Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
This is Tubbs. Sorry I can't answer the phone, I'm out square dancing. Leave a message--
Hello Tubbs.  Can I come in?
They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
Shit, what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys.  I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?
Both at the same bank...
You must be going somewhere.
We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
What?
Remember when you asked for a study on him, I refused. Same goes for now.
I wouldn't presume to try.
I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
Christ!
He'd know it from articles he's read about Lecktor...
'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book?
Not the Bible?
I'll try to keep him as far away from it as I can...
I need to talk to you about Will Graham.
Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces.  None of them knew that;
No.
As long as they're dead...
What do you want to do?
I know...
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time.
What is it?
Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.
Wait, Will...
Get me a plane!
From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning.
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
What?
It's not over yet.
You wanna watch this or what?!
He had to.
Stay in the trees.
The activities of nocturnal animals.
I'll get my purse.
The developing room.  I need to... see you.
I'll see you later. All right?
You'll come by?
Francis did a thing for you today so I couldn't have you. And he was wrong.  I AM THE DRAGON!  Give me your hand.
No!
Was I in an accident?
Atoning, Mr. Lounds.
Yes.
Not me.
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
'I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand.  'Will Graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. Because I was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you.  'I will be a testament to the truth, now.  About his work. About his becoming.'
When we were cleaning out Dr. Lector's cell, he heard us coming and hid something in a book... We got him out of there and dug around...
Uh... sure...
Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too
That's all we know about.  Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior.  You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin...  He bites a lot.
What's average?
What happened to them?
Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
If I were?
Hey, baby! Where are you?
None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
Do you remember what you said?
I wanted it over fast.  It felt dirty to not tell you.
I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn't you call me?
What's that?
Oh, Jesus... Come in.  Honey...!
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
And Hobbs died?
Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will?
Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
Yes.
I thought you would have some ideas.
There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
No. I knew that I'm not smarter than you are.
Yes.
Do you dream much, Will?
I don't have one right now.
May I keep the file?
Do you know how you caught me, Will?
And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes place in a taxi stand!  And you're gonna be the Fonzie!
Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
Oh, you know the Bay Area!  Always foggy!
There'll be other shots.
But wasn't it funny?
What, you don't think I can beat him?
I -- I got some freaky rare kind. It's called large-celled carcinoma.
It's visualization therapy.  He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease.
Do you wanna tour the clubs?
You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.
Yeah...
Well, everyone else gets this place cookin'!  Pal, it's hard for me to move the booze when you're singin' "Pop Goes The Weasel."
No!  That is NOT an audience!  That is PLASTER!  An audience is people made of flesh!  They -- live and breathe!  Got it?!
But that's it.  I needed you to believe!  Our family will be in the newspapers.  People will look, and they'll be touched.  Because your emotions were honest!
No no no, it's not sex!  I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling.
Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody else.
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!
Oh, it's open.
You don't know the real me.
Have you told your family?
Okay.  You're probably right.
You're not listening to me --
But I don't do drugs!  And I don't enjoy making light of them!  I was promised creative control!
And you're just poor white trash!
The wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual.  It seems you have no respect for anything.
I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!
Where?
What's your name?
Bob.
Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.
No way.  Not possible.
That's the third white van I've seen.
Should Tank I.D. it?
Hear what?
Don't tell me you're a believer now?
An accident?!
Sorry.
How?
Cypher?
He's beginning to believe.
Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we both know there's more to it than that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?
The Matrix?
Be what?  Be real?
Wild, isn't it?
What -- what lesson?
Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.
The beginning?
And she's never wrong.
We need an exit.
Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
We're on our way --
I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.
Shit, I'm sorry.
But what?
But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
How do you know that name?
Who are you?
It's going into replication.
What happened?  What did you see?
It might have been.  I'm not sure.
It wasn't fast enough.
Guns.  Lots of guns.
Tank, I need a pilot program for a military M-109 helicopter.
Hurry, Neo.
Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
Great...great...listen, I'm very interested in you guys because I'll be opening a new club myself soon... uptown...and maybe we can work something out...
Yeah, well, keep away from those Chinx.  They don't have shit.
Ok.  For another $5.00 a special on the packs.
I gotta get the stuff.
Nervous?
I'll say that I'm travelling.
Yeah, I'm gonna worry about you, too.
I could have told you that.
We'll get some food from my aunt's. I'll get in through the fire escape. She's always got something.
Did you see them run!
Oh, that's too bad, Teresa...
He has about twenty-eight bucks... it's all he has on him.
What pipes...the ones from last year...those pipes.
Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me.
Sell 'em if you can't smoke them.
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
Get him in.
C'mon Johnny.
You getting out too?
Charlie, this is business.
Chinese food?
What did he do?
Yeah.  That's what I said, sick in the head.
"Francis Macomber."
Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.
That's the word...preoccupied.
I can take care of myself.  You know that.
Now don't get excited.  Don't get excited!!
Hey, c'mon - no bullshit - friends.
Thanks.
Yeah, speak for yourself.
Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?
Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
I know you do, darling.
Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?
From the Korean War.
It's for the party, Dad --
It's starting to grow on me.  But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?
The fountain is the Caspian Sea and the Sea is serving up caviar.  The 'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for Petrossian.  Of course, they also stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.
That you've been to Susan?
But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay.  Because I know you love me.  Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, "What does she want now?"
Honey --!
Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --
Yes sir, Mr. Black, a pleasure.
How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
Toast?  No...just the butter.
So I guess a blowjob's out of the question?
Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
You're taking this too far, Drew.
Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
'Here'?
Thank you.
Well, I'm going to tell you anyway. I did cheat on that exam at Groton. But so did twenty-six other guys, and nobody ever mentioned it until today.  And I'm expecting you won't mention it again.  I don't know who you are and where you're getting your information, but I'm willing to pretend I did not hear it, and let bygones be bygones.  But can I tell you something else, it'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him.  What are you, his shadow?  Do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak?  You know some- times somebody would like a few min- utes alone with W.P.  That means without you.  Okay, pal?  Let's eat.
What'd it say?
No no, not you.
Sounds good.
Olympic.
Before I do --  I was hoping we might be alone, Bill.
I don't think so.  Do you?
The answer is no, quick enough for you?
Don't you want to hear the details?
You get not to go to jail.
Yeah.  Neat.
You're on, Quin-cee.  Destination Hospital.  Joe, you'll be the Tour Guide.  Okay?  How's that sound to you?
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
My Doctor Lady?
Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.
Can do no right by people.  Come to take, you wan' to stay, leave you stay, you wan' to go.  Rahtid!
Lunch is 'in' today, have you given it any thought --_
On the other hand, Winston Churchill drank a bottle of cognac a day and lived until he was ninety-one.
You love Allison, don't you?
I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in.
What do you mean 'free'?
Come again?
I don't have any.
I can see why.
I don't know.
I am, too.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married.
'To bed'?
Yes, he's tired.  I believe so.
I loved it.
More than you love peanut butter?
Where are you going?
We know all that we need to know --
I love you now, I'll love you always --
No --
Good morning, Bill.
How are you?  How're you feeling?
Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything, Bill.  You'll ruin the good start we had last night.  I felt as if I were being treated like a person.  'Joe' this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile - Quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting, but I am cer- tain, should you - uh - say - uh - who I am - our adventure would end abruptly.
It is a deal?
I'm not everybody.
Can you keep a secret?
So can I.
I don't understand.
Uh-huh.
Well...I don't know.
This part I'm interested in.
Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
What are you saying, that it's time to go?
Well, they're mine now.
It's time to put this person where he belongs.
An offense --
You're coming to 'take me'.  What is that?  Who the hell are you?
Speak up, please.
Then don't.
What?
Just think of millenniums multiplied by aeons compounded by infinity, I've been around that long, but it's only recently that your affairs here have piqued my interest.  Call it boredom, the natural curiosity of me, the most lasting and significant element in existence has come to see you.
Show me around.  Be my guide.  And in return, you get...
In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.
Yes, Bill.  The question.
I am, this is it.  B Day.
How's that, Quince?
But I've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, I've got some great prospects I've developed.  I want to talk to you about them next week.
Next week?
No thank you, Quince.  I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at this.  Why don't you choose whatever cake you like?
I'm going to stick it out here.  We still have a shot.
No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.
So what's wrong with that?
Well, it worries me.  I want you to get swept away.  I want you to levitate.  I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.
'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
Nothing.
When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.
Where's he going?
C'mon!  The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
The fireworks are about to start.
Damn right.  Looking for her right now.  Who knows?  You might be her.
-- This is my lucky day.  I arrive in this big bad city and I not only find a doctor, a beautiful woman as well.
Did I say something wrong?
This has nothing to do with you. You helped me out, and I'm grateful.
Sense of humour went with the memory, huh? You know why you're still here, don't you?
That must suck. All... backwards.				 *
Hi, Leonard.
When was I in here?
Why didn't you clean it out?					 *
You're still paying for it. It's still Your room.
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing?
Tell me about her again.
Don't remember.
Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.
They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
Who?! Fuck, Leonard! Dodd! Dodd beat the shit out of me.
I told him about your car.
Somebody's come. Already.
Don't protect him.
How?
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
Oh. But haven't we met before?
You're in a playful mood.
Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.		    * Why are we going there?
I'll be waiting.							   *
You don't have to remember to be hungry.
Probably left it in your room.
He's got to have a car, right? We just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him.
Fucking hope not.
Why?
So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?
Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.
The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back.
Wouldn't be appropriate.						*
Maybe. Maybe just.
Somehow, I'll know!
Quit it!							 * 					   * You're not a killer, Lenny. That's why			 * you're so good at it.						   *
Gottingen.  That's in Sweden.
"And" what?
He any good?
It's a rip and a hit.
You said Nazi Low-riders...?
Sure.
25% discount on the load.
What's the recovery?  How much are you looking for?
And what is that?
Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
...and therafore there is no consequence?
They're all the same.  "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you."
Why?
When?
Whenever.  Maybe later, maybe sooner.
Is this the protective male talk?
So we can close each other's eyes right now.  Real easy.  Real fast.  But, then, nobody makes any money...
What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.
Mega-tonnage and mega-cash flow...
So we want to change-up the mission statement.
There is "undercover."  And there is "Which way is up?"
Twenty on my man...
"Buy and walk"?  "Buy and bust"? "Reverse undercover"?  What?
Who's the "we"?  There's you and there's us.  And all we got from you was bad intel.  "Low-level producer."  Yeah, right...
How will it stand up?
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.
We think NLR.  We don't know! Alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet.  He wasn't deep into the crew.
We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.
What flowers?
I like the diminished risk.  It frees up capital reserves.  I like working with self-interested businessmen who are competent.  You can predict their behavior....
They will kill you.  And then they will kill your wife, too.
The Feeb gig was I front a coupla undercover, Russian-speakers to them.  One's ATF.  And broker the deal.  Set up the meet with the NLR types...
Beg pardon, ma'am?
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
I got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat folding money...  He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day's pay. And if he ain't man enough to do it for himself, I be happy to oblige!
No. Of course not. Just something struck me funny...
So you could sleep! I mean Christ!
Well, I hope you know what you're in for. I'm a very dangerous person. Someone does me bad like you. If I caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead Ratso long about now. Hear?
The coat? A guy I did a favor once gave it to me. Christ.
I'm scared.
No doctors. No, sir. Not me. Doctors are like goddam auto mechanics. Fix one-thing, unplug another. Operate for piles and while they're there, they unscrew your liver. My old man, for God's sake, wasn't any sicker'n I am when he went to the doctor.
You know what's wrong with you? You got fevers. You kinky as a bedbug. How you gonna get to Florida?
Here I am going to Florida and my leg hurts, my butt hurts, my chest hurts, my face hurts, and like that ain't enough, I gotta pee all over myself.
Get outta my way.
But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.
Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you two are a couple -- ?
Getchmis...?
Shit.
Don't worry about it.  Right now money doesn't count. Okay?
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
Sure.
Sixty?
No!  I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car.
Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got...
A hundred grams.
That doesn't seem so bad.
Hello.
What do you mean?
Billy!  Please!
Get the... midnight... express.
What?
His radio Back of his open, radio...
Oh shit.
If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they say it's easy to cross the border into Greece?
Jeremy...
Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris Raymond, will you?
Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. That's the old maintenance grid, Doc. Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...
You wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude.
Look what you did! You stupid sonofa-
Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...
What?
No way we can outrun 'em together. Move it!
I needed to think. It was either this or the weather channel.
I heard how you talked to him.
I know.  But if it was carrying something...there's a chance you could have been exposed.
What-
That's it. That's it. Breathe easy.
I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah...
What do you want to know?
It's right this way.
You got a point there...
What are they...?
Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
I don't have a title yet.
Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?
I can take it, go ahead.
Pretty rough so far.
I guess that means it's okay.
Yes.
As long as it does exist, your mind won't ever be free. I think you should light the match, Paul.
Thank you for thinking of me.  Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?
No, just the paper will be fine.
Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you.
You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.
The "gotta." Remember, you talked about it in Playboy magazine. You said there's a million things you can't do in this world; you can't hit a curve ball, you can't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- but there's one thing you always have, and that's the power of the "gotta."
What?
Not even a hint?
Whenever he played Radio City, who do you think was right there in the front row?
My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.
You really think so?
Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?
Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles...
Three more chapters to go.
Maybe.
It will.
You did perfect. Except for one thing. This time we need two glasses.
Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
What? What is it?
He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
I'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books.
Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange?
You think he might be missing?
Are you kidding? Every time that fella writes a book, she makes me set aside the first copy.
Did they win?
I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.
Well, you've thorough about it, at any rate.
On what.
Maybe that's it, then.  Everything's upside down and backwards...
And you're going to have time.  There's been a change of plans.
What are you talking about?
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
Somebody's been slipping you our mail. Come on out here, you bad girl.
Not at all.  But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site?
What if I pay the rent?
Uh-huh?
Oh, either way works for me.
Far right.
- this is very disconerting..
They've got a book for everything.
That they're lying.
Five, six-hundred thousand.
There's nearly 2 million in London.
Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?
Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is keeping a very capable thief off the street..
You don't trust me.
Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character.
Have you met them?
I'll muddle through.
It's going to be okay.
Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..
The question is why?  What was this Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying?
We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
Yes, I believe that's right.  Now my understanding is that 20 hours after exposure, the victim becomes infectious. Highly infectious.
She sacrificed herself..
I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll let you know where I'm going.
They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.
Put in the coordinates and let's get a visual.  The visuals aren't coming up.
Why not?
Left jacket pocket?
She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs.  One klick away.
And if we donít find him - weíll search the whole train again.
Stay out of this. OR Lachez - moi OR T'agueue
Talking's good, walking's better.
Who is they, who is they?
What kind of help?
You don't think we're going to make it.
Bastard!
Is this the only way?
You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
Of course - Iím sorry to hear you say that Claire.
Ethan?
One hour.
The arms dealer.
That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
Profitable.
You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.
Do you <u>want</u> to blow the fire through the whole building?
What's the matter, you don't know this trick?
Very well.
I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me.
Tell you what?
What problem?
Sure.  If the main character does.
What he didnít get in Prague.  The NOC list.
I usually am.
I always check the batteries.
We will both have the Salad Ticino.
I forgot to wave. We'll have it at the wedding.
You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta?
Rita. Pass the wine.
Why you drinking so much?
Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo.
You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
You look tired.
No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?
He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
Maybe.
Good morning, Lucy.
Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five minutes.
Why?
I'm going to marry him.
That's it.
Why what?
I don't know.
Why you talking to me?
You think so?
To the bed.
Loretta.
Get all of me. Take everything.
Take it easy.
What?
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
I wanna go home.
I know what I know.
And what do you know? You tell me my life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf? You run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! You're gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. You waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again?
You're late!
And you're not now?
No.
Give him the manicotta, Bobo. Me, too.
Then let's set the date.
You have a brother?
In time, you will drop dead, and I will come to your funeral in a red dress.
I got married before, you didn't sell.
Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there.
Well. I don't really know where to start.
No more he's not.
She recovered.
Hi. Why ain't you at the store?
What sins have you to confess?
He should pay.
Come on in.
Yes.
But why would a man need more than one woman?
I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.
I'll remember that. What do you do?
Nerves.
Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming.
Yes.
Sure.
Yes.
What? What?
It's Cosmo's moon.
Oh. Right.
Does wood sink in water?
Bread?  No, no, no.  Apples .... gravy ... very small rocks ...
It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.  King of all Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!
How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
Well, how did you become king, then?
Who are they?
All right!  What do you want?
How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?
Had enough?
You stupid bastard.  You havn't got any arms left.
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
Who ... Who breaks out?
No!  Not the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
Yes, my liege.  Stand by for attack!!
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
I do.  You seek the Holy Grail.
Follow!
There he is!
... You silly sod.
Who did we lose?
What?
Shut up!
Yes, Lord.
I feel happy... I feel happy.
Blue.
Stop! Who approacheth the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see!
I dunno, Must be a king.
And another!
No!  Not the curtains, lad ...  All that ...  all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ... that'll be your kingdom, lad.
Father, lad.
But I don't like her.
Shut up!  You only killed the bride's father - that's all -
Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.
The Prince ... ?
Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
The what?  But you are tired and you must rest awhile.  Midget! Crapper!
Oh ... hello ...
You are in great peril.
Look - I'm fine!
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
No, no, no.
Seventy a year.
Sixty.
What?
Aye, but will they?
But I'm the only one she trusts.
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
It's a diary.
Kitchen and lower house.
Are you all right, Barney?
Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
I'm flattered you think so.
Quite.
She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk to her there.
... Least of all my son.  It was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave.
It is quite late enough.
And that is my last word on the matter.
We --
How will I know?
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
That can wait till the weekend.
In as much as the article is about yourself, I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you.
Nobody has any rights over me.
We are all of us subject to forces beyond our control, Mr Brown, even you.
I recommend Her Majesty uses the covered carriage with a full Horse Guard.  In the event of any disturbance I will ensure --
A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen.  It was remiss of me not to come earlier.
Dare say you can be taught.
If you hunt, you kill.
For Her Majesty.
She trusts you, John.
The threat.  I tell them, but they don't see it.
The greasy pole.
And the pony?
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
Aye, ma'am.
Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
Who by?
He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
I heard something.
I'm breaking no promises!
In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave.  A figurehead.
Well, both.
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion.
We'll see which way the wind blows.
Who?
She's refusing to leave Balmoral.
I was trying to imagine "rather upset."
Not too protracted, I hope.
We think she can be dissuaded.  Have you had a glance at the diary?
How ill is he?
Yes, ma'am.
Unwell?
Why?
He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.
And now I am back.
I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.
Just tell me the fucking riddle.
Sure.
How do you do that?
He?
It's the game, ARCADE.
But you always lie, so you didn't come from there.  That means the city on the left must be the City of Truth.
But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...
I'm in the middle of it...
No.  Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway...  I think the game's alive somehow.
All of them?
What are you going to do?
Yes I am...
I know.  It sucks.
Don't even say it.
Yeah, that's what worries me.
There...
One of them, anyway...  Did you see it?  The Screamer?
There never is.
So tell me you're okay, then.
I'm okay.
You have no time.  What is your question?
I'm thinking!
You have no time.
I am giving her a chance.  Why don't you get off my back?
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
And?
Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?
So why did you idiots bring me here? ... I'm in the middle of making a picture.
A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin' you agree with?
Okay, I'm thinking.
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
I understand.
So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?
I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
Honey, all the great ones came through here at one time or another.
Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
You got it! See you later honey.
So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.
I think I've been hurt.
But, this could be serious.
All right, but...I'm going to check on you.
You don't remember anything else?
What is it? What do you see?!
The one of 'em still alive?
What's going on ?
I'm working on it.
You've been doing a bang up job so far. Right now Matt is probably dead and it's your fault.
Why did you build this whole place ?
Is this really the time ?
I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
I do a very thorough background check. I go through police files, personel files, anything.
Fine...
That was eleven years ago.
Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.
I told him not to sit down in there.....
Trust me, if you open any door, you'll be dead a whole lot sooner.
You were one of those guys that played Dungeons & Dragons with real swords, weren't you.
That's cute asshole.
What ? Are you my mother ?
Not down here. I'll start trusting you when I feel there the time is right. It's not personal, it's just survival.
And who bailed you out when a hit was put on you, you sorry sack of shit. Who put you up ? Who gave you a job ?
I just want to double check the facts.
Excuse me, sir ?
Relax, son. They'll learn in time that you don't fuck with First Bank. This is the real deal and we aim to keep it strong. My Daddy always told me that Only The Strong Survive.
I had suggested that they tone down the program so that the "guests" might take longer to expire.
Zach, my boy ! How is tonights adventure going ?
Might I ask why you no longer work for the mob ?
There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.
No. I am not a homosexual.
I can see your small business ! Look at it it's so small.
<<belch>>
He's got two chices.either it's the Bowling Alley from Hell or Alice in Murderland. See this ? Even Bruce knows that no one can make it out of here in one piece.
It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?
Yes.
You have a real nice place... how can you afford this working as a temp ?
Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
Maybe we should make the time. Especially considering the sixteen million dollars we have set aside expressly to settle law suits from these very events.
Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
Pommeroy...he may or may not be driving a black 54 Ford Pickup.  Monday.
I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
Totally groovy huh?
I will. How's Shelly?
I love you too sweetie, bye.
Give my love to Shelly.
Disaster, disaster lurks behind every  palm tree.
You're being narrow-minded.
You are?

I'll try.
I've got something better.
It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
I don't know. And I don't care, Kevin's a jerk and I don't like him anymore. He's all yours!
Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.
I never met my mother.
Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start.
What ever happened to a good old-fashioned favor huh?
I love the fragrance of chilidogs.
Change my name.
Just give it to me!!
Leave me alone!!
Jerk! You IDIOT!!!
Good. I mean...
Some sacrifices are worth it.
Was Rose.
Well, wha...what kind of arrangement?
How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
This is it I guess.
Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.
Sounds great, well you give 'em both one of these for me.
No, that's not a date, a date is when I don't cook.
You know how I feel about you.
You like the way I cook...you think I make out a great invoice.  PHIL You and Nick and...and this...this garage are my whole life...I love you. Sure you don't have the greatest taste in music...but there's not another woman who could look so sexy in that smock. What I'm try... what I'm trying to sa...
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
Well maybe for you.
Something wrong?
All right, so you don't like jewelry but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. Liszt, one of my favorites.
I bet your mom sang to you.
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
I know, I guess it's just sort of preparing you for the rest of your life. It's not easy being a woman.
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?
Hey! Oh look.
Who didn't? She could play basketball like Jerry West, she danced like Sid Cherice, then she'd look at you with those big blue eyes, forget about it. I asked her out a couple of times but she always said no.
Do you know him?
Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy.
It's there.
Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.
What Hurts Vada?
Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
Yes they are.
That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school Marm.  Fix it.
I'm sure she will.
It's no big deal.
Want to what?
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Honestly Harry, he got the mustang, I promise.....
Did you ahh, love him?
Perfect.
I'm not asking you to stop feeling for those people. But life isn't just death Harry, don't ignore the living, especially your daughter.
O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of the fridge.
Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!
What?
Can I go too?
Sorry.
Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the cart, anything at all.  I don't know what's gotten into her today.
Is that the fish you won at the carnival?
I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
That's good, memories are good sweetheart. Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me.  Seeya in the morning.
Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry.
No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?
Look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while!
Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this summer, so, I'm doing some work.
Thirty five dollars.
Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada?
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
No.
Cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared.
You know what I think? I think Vada's very lucky to have a friend like you.
Probably.
Really?
Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry.
I don't think so.  Shelly, how can I get thirty five dollars?
Sure. I'll give you the royal tour.
Do you like putting makeup on people?
Well he just left, what's wrong?
I'm hemorrhaging.
It's okay, come on upstairs, we have to have a little talk.
I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
Yes.
What?
Don't DO that!!
Bed wetter!
Go???
Hurry!!!
I wanna live with them too.
Then go home, baby.
Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's and it won't be fair.
Just, hurry.
Well, then, I'll take it up with her.
I should look different.
You should look like you dressed yourself.
I'm just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective.
If your ass isn't chapped, you are not a good-writer of note.
... weeks.
The wandering sportswriter.
It's called the Law of Love, asshole.
... and having "done the right thing" will only really be comforting, oh, maybe, five, six times.
Someday she'll thank you.
What do you suggest?
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
Hey, handsome.  Brevity this...
I can be quick.  I can even be funny.
See.  Dry.  It's in the delivery.
He said that, too.
But he sure can kiss.
Let me rephrase that...
Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...
Hello.
... well, maybe it works on fingers, too.
I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules.
I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect the inconsequentials.
Yeh, well my old machine kept eating messages.  I tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement, but finally...
W...
I can't wait for you to meet her!
Mirrors.
Me either.
I'll check.  I have it on powerbook, these days.
Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing business.  Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there...
Mike.  I can't believe I'm doing this to you on the night before your wedding.  But I think you need and deserve to know...
"Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl."
A bad combination.
Look, I came down here to face everybody.  I didn't want to slink away like some coward...
She admits it's her fault.
You never want to do that, see, that's always a... costly turnover.  As they say in the sport biz.
Lower.
No, it's, uh... a real big favor.
MICHAEL!!
Okay by me - I'd sure like to see that Opryland.
Hi! Star.
Then why are you listening to her -
What's wrong with her.
Okay. Thanks.
His Word.
Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.
A little slow, but she'll be fine.
What!
Okay, then we'll see you there.
Okay.
How come?
Not yet.
Business School so I can run Haven's business.
Sure he will.
Yes, sir. I need a room
I think we can do that. Come in.
I'm not really a musician.
Okay... you get to sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
I'1l get your bag.
No.
Nash.
But, I'll take some of that Nyquil... you know it puts you right to sleep no matter what's wrong, you go right off...
Yes, it is --
It just is.
About three years.
Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
Yes.
Oh.
I'm not sure.
Older.
They said go see the chaplain.
Where are you going?
Mary?
Do you study at all?
Come on.
Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time.
Oh --
He is to a lot of people.
He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
You always live there?
Spent time in Arizona. Why?
Ryan O'Neal.
Sure thing.
More or less...
Grace. I'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother Tim, if you feel up to it.
Yeah.
Who is we?
Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that.
Susanville, Soledade.
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
So, how do I fit into this scheme?
By all means.
Do you have a back up.
Good...yuppie piece of shit.
Manson beat you.
She doesn't talk?
All right, Mickey.
Let's discuss it when I'm unbound.
Was massacring all those people worth being separated from your wife for the rest of your life?
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.
When have they ever been right?
No.
I said I'd give you a interview. Now unless I'm mistaken, we just did a interview.  We did an interview, didn't we?
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
Survival of the fittest.
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
So you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies included, my chocolate cream filled?
Two-thirty. Shhh...
I assigned you Bingham and Washington to go along.
They pay you three bucks a day an' all the cotton you can eat.
Out.
You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
That's no way to talk, boy. Now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. Stirred up a lot of trouble. They're always after you colored boys.
So it wasn't funny, huh? Well, I thought it was. What d'you say, Barney? Wasn't it funny?!
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
Where's Wilma?
Like where?
I don't know. He's your boy.
I don't know.
Name's Duff.
Guess I don't.
Just so you do your work.
No. What you usually say, I guess.
That's right. How' you doin', Barney?
Like hell they wouldn't.
Cup of coffee.  I 'been meanin' to talk to you.
Okay, I will.
I'm a teacher.
No. My mother's dead.  You goin' back inside?
Oh yeah? Well, I guess you got no choice.
Well, that's a funny thing to say.
How about another beer?
Hell, baby, I bet you think we got tails.
You got a problem all right.
Take it easy.
Oh yeah, and then what?
What?
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
Good night, Duff.
No.
No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
What happened, Duff?
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
Okay. Come on. Put 'em up!
Go on - hit me!
My father's never done a thing for any of them.
What about your boy?
I keep thinking about him.
We can always do that, Duff.
I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
'Bye, Jocko.
Wouldn't have known you.
Wouldn't have known you.
She don't look no worse to me.
Whenever he's got an edge on.
How often is that?
Okay.
Who is?!
Guess it's never been easy.
Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
Well, that figures.  Kind of fits in with everything else, don't it!
Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
I'll be seeing you.
How you doin'?  Hi there!
Is that right?  Think you're gonna make it with her?
What's the matter?! You mad at me?
Nothin'.  She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ - haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more.  Let's get out'a here. This place gives me the willies.  You got some money?
What's the matter?! It's a celebration!
Anything you say, baby.
They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon.
Why not?
This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.
That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
Linked?
Stick with her. I want the process to become second nature to you. We fly for Freeside at dawn.
What are you talking about?
I find out now.
Can you read my mind?
Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
Jah guides us.
You can make your move when it comes after me.
No!... No...
There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see, you've been avoiding me, Case.
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
Too late?
Okay fine. Let's get this over with.
Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
Shut up.
Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
Why do they listen to Guy?
Yeah. Let's do that.
That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.
Oh. I forgot.
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
What about the "Roaring Twenties"… or "The 80's"?
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
Just get in the van, Josie.
I'm not doing this until I speak with Gus.
Uh uh. I'm Disco Barbie.
Transitioned?
You crossed over.
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
But I don't want it straightened out.
Geller, this is way out of your league.
Oh. Right.
Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
What if I say no?
Are you in special ed?
My sword.
Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.
Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college.  We just go right into sheep herding.
I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
Of course I do. Josie, you owe it to yourself--to your writing, to go to college. You're a great writer. You just have to find your story.
Wait, I was going to tell you--
The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
I thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time.
Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
Maybe we should sit.
<i>                      Now in the box, we'll wait and hide Until his curiosity Entices him to look inside...</i>
<i>                      Three of a kind...</i>
And heavy...
Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
There's nothing more suspicious than Worm's Wart -- it distracts one from every other taste and smell.
<i>                      You're so stupid, think now -- If we blow him up to smithereens, We may lose some pieces and then Jack will beat us black and green.</i>
I told you I want that room unpacked.
Don't tell me it's not the gas!
I wasn't sure, Ken...
Alright then, what is it?  Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.
Ah, nothing.
That's typical.  I hope she didn't expect to make the best seller list with this thing.
You don't have to.  You just have to believe in energy.
Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...
I thought you might be able to make a connection.
About what?
I'm sorry to hear that, but you're the experts on this, not me.  If I had any insights, believe me, I'd share them with you.
Hi Mom.
Wait and see.
I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
It's an amazing gift.
Sure.
He's too strong!  He was never this strong!
Can't be good news coming from you.
Oh yeah?  Well, if you're ever in the mood for a history lesson, I'm your teacher, understand?
I'll have a file cabinet in there before tomorrow.  The patient's rooms are down here.
Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
You know what he did.  He's doing it again.
We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview.  I don't know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake.
Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much.  your parents still live around here?
With Hypnocyl?
C'mon.  Let's get out of this rain.
Who would know where they were hidden?
The by-product of guilt.  Psychological scars steaming from moral conflicts and overt sexuality.
A sad choice.
Mary Helena.
I beg your pardon?
You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.
Oh sure.  That's just the sorta thing parents tell their kids:  "Goodnight honey.  Don't forget ot say your prayers. Oh, by the way, your father and I torched some maniac last night."
Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.
Well... a shot at it.
You're right.  I told you I was bad at acting.
I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?
Oh -- Okay.
Obviously.  Very difficult.
No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade.  I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...
You abide by rules like that?
She left me.
I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.
Thank you.  I'm just in London for two days -- but, with your papers, it's the worse place to be.
Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'
I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.
You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
Jesus.
You do?
I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
You really don't get it.  This story gets filed.  Every time anyone writes anything about me -- they'll dig up these photos.  Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever.
But... wait... there are things to say.
You disappeared.
Well, don't over-do it.  I don't want people saying, 'There goes that famous actor with the big, fat girlfriend."
Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God.
... get fired.
It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.
Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.
Da Vinci?
Well, thanks, that's great.
I'm sorry.  I didn't get down what magazines you're from.
Ah... yes, enormously.
Can I help you?
Okay.  Tell me, would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you?
I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
Definitely no comment.
I think you do, yes.
Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
No, don't think I do.
May I help you, sir?
Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?
Does she know you're coming?
No, no.  She doesn't.
Oh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...
Well, there you go.  On for a video fest tonight?  I've got some absolute classic.
Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you?
I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect.
I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it?
And you get on very well.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
No, Miss Ratched...
No. Mister Harding, that is not true.
N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.
Mister Sefelt?
Hold the fort down, will ya, fellas!
All in good time, Mister McMurphy. All in good time.
Good. Now if you'll just go along with Mister Washington, he'll see that you're properly oriented.
How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
So do I!
Well, I'll be a son-of-a-bitch...
Yes, Miss Ratched...
H-H-Hearts.
B-B-Billy.
Wh-wh-where ya going, M-M-Mac?
Go ahead! Go back!
C-C-Come here and l-look at th this!
It's okay, kid. Everything it going to be okay... I'll come back an' getcha in a while... 'Kay...
What? Where?
It's your dirty roll, Cheswick.
Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you!
I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
Well, it doesn't hurt him either!  Does it, Chief!  See, it doesn't hurt him.  Jump! An' put it in!
I just started!
Well, if you gentlemen will excuse me, I have some pressing matters to attend to.
No!
Yesterday...
Gary Blinker...
Hit me.
Me, too! Me, too!
Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what's been comin' down in that loony bin.
All I'm askin' is...
You're on!
I don't believe it...
Prayin', brother. Prayin'.
Miss Itsu.  In here, please.
Oh...
Nobody leaves here till seven thirty.
Is everything all right?
At this hour?
Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...
You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!
Shhh... let's move it away from the window...
Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...
Of course not.
Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
Yes.
Sure-- But, before you do that, since we're putting all our cards on the table, I have a confession to make, too.
No.
My car bumper has never held a winning sticker.
Ha un numero di telefono?
A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.
Thanks.
Amazing.
This is his fiancee.  Who's this?
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.
Yes.
So?!  Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
Where's Positano?
Nice dress.
There's no such thing.
Reptilian swine.  There's no such thing.  Reptiles aren't swine.
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
I sabotaged it?  You're the one who lost him, remember?
What would you call it?
Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
Very funny.
I brought you that, too.
Sure is.
Yeah.  He's around somewhere.
Oh.
Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
I don't know.  I don't think so.
He's a podiatrist or something.
If you've never been out with him, how do you know you don't want to go out with him?
I think he's having an affair.
You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
Live happily ever after.
I don't know...  Maybe.  Think of it as an adventure.
"Of the Rich and Famous".  Of which we are neither.  Are you out of your mind?  We can't afford this.
Well, we're here.  And more importantly, he's here.  We'll cut back on everything else.
Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
And then what, Faith?
Why?
Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be.  I've got forty-eight hours.  I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened.
I'm just not ready to go home quite yet, that's all.
I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
Uh huh.
Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.
He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
This is your most lucky day.  My family runs a pension not three blocks from here.
No, why?
No.
It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
Confused kid? First he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker, and pretty soon I'm just another fellow down here.
I figured the worst they'd do is work him over a little.
They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
Sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It's time you got some ambition.
Absolutely nothing. You do nothing and you say nothing. You understand, don't you, kid?
I know. I know.
Well, then, you know Cousin Johnny isn't going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubber-lipped—
...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
See! You don't understand!
Okay— I'll tell him I couldn't bring you in. Ten to one they won't believe it, but— go ahead, blow. Jump out, quick, and keep going... and God help you from here on in.
You think I'm just a gravy-train rider in a turned-around collar?
Tommy, what happened?
They play pretty rough.
I'll get home all right now.
Everybody knew him. He got around.
Looked like two pieces of rope. And your teeth were—
How would you've done it?
What?
When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'd— get into bad company.
That's my own flock up there, getting their evening workout. I won plenty of races with 'em.  Listen, you want to see them? Come up on the roof with me and I'll show 'em to you.
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or— or human kindness in your whole body.
But a priest...?
I don't want it. But why don't you stay and finish your drink.
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
I can't let myself fall in love with you.
It was Johnny Friendly who killed Joey, wasn't it?
I don't rate it.
Who says?
What I did to Joey.
It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
Edie...
I'll take it out of their skulls.
Don't hang on to me. And don't follow me. Don't follow me.  Call the Father. Ask him to take care of Charley for me. My brother. There's something I got to do.
Get out of my way.
You always said I was a bum. Well—  —not anymore. I'm going down to the dock. Don't worry, I'm not going to shoot anybody. I'm just going to get my rights.  Joey's jacket. It's time I start wearing it.
Who is he! Edie, you're so softhearted and soft-headed you wouldn't recognize the devil if he had you by the throat. You know who this Terry Malloy is? The kid brother of Charlie the Gent, Johnny Friendly's right hand, a butcher in a camel hair coat.
You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to have you go walkin' with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown, before I put a strap to you.
Someone else c'n take your confession.
What are you going to do?
About Edie?
Your gun.
I can? Okay.  Okay...
And I still say you stand up and I'll stand up with you.
What?
I'm just resting my feet.
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and—
I'll never forget it. I thought it was all over.
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.
Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody... .  You think I should turn him in?
I'll bring him up to your loft.
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
Not a dent.  Perfect
You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He doesn't know much.
Listen, Johnny—
You want to know somethin'—?
I said beat it! At the right time I'll catch up with you. Be thinkin' about it.
One little dime you don't need.  I know you— you're Edie Doyle. Your Brother's a saint—  –only one ever tried to get me my compensation.
But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?
Who's to say my monsters aren't alive?
As you wish, Master
It would seem so, Master
Well then let us proceed.
Then cancel my order.
All others were but infinitessimal bits of fluff, compared to <i>her</i>  This one would have <i>died</i> for feathers, furs, and fluff...and so she did!
You may take her now.
Hurt her?  Hell, it killed her!
When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
Aaarrrgggaahh.
Who is it?
He said he was a card player.  I could live with that.  I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce.  He said, "Okay."  Jack's so easy going.  He was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband.
Thank you.
Why you want to do that, to a frien'?
The Wall Street guy?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't recognize him without his rug.
She's coming with us.
Cause she had her hand on her gun the whole time, waiting to make her move.
Oh, man.
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
Just that she got away.
Now you're talkin'.
She just sat there, looking right at me.
Let's drive by where we're meeting and have a look.  Maybe take a look at Ripley's place while we're at it.
Let fate decide?  What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
What?
All you gotta do is get in.
Jack --
Isn't that my report you're holding onto?
In the trunk, yeah?
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
The time came, you shot him.  But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.  They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay, now you got your Sig in your hand.  You say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down.  But when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap the two guys then?
Sounds to me like he liked having you around.  I'll see you, Karen.  Mr. Sisco.
The manager's door is metal.
Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.
Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window.  Fuckin' animals.
No, I didn't know that.
I'll need a last known address.
Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.
There a problem, Foley?
Low class of people there, Snoop.
I thought everything.
If I could have a little more room.
There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?
You devil, it's mace, huh?  What've you got here, a billy?  Use it on poor unfortunate offenders.
Uh-huh.
Who was it answered the phone?
That's my dad.
One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island.
I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
It smelled.
I called your room from downstairs.
Yeah, but in a nice way.
I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...
You think he's lying?
I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.
You know who they are?
Oh, uh, right, thanks...
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
What's to think about?
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
We'll go to my bank.  I'll make a withdrawal.
And so now you're off to Glades.
Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van.
Wait.  <i>Have</i> you helped him, Glenn?  At this point, technically, I doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive. So you still have a choice.  You can help him and risk going down again, get cuffed and shackled, hope to God you pull a reasonable judge, not some hard-on.  Or, if you want to play it another way...
Jesus, I don't believe it.
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
Really?
Gimme another hint.
Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here. Question is, why aren't <u>you</u> here?
Can I do what?
Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
Yeah, Kenneth, why you have to do that to that poor girl.
Oh...
Your dog was killed?
What did you call it?
I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me.
Oh, he's moved out?
What'd I say?
No, he looks a lot...
Hello?
When's he due back?
That's right, just me.
No.  Course not.
Foley's got it.
Yeah.  But if I have to get something out, I c-can always s-s-s-  SIIING!
Too late for apologies, Walker.
The one that slept in my mouth last night.
Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma, you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come with us!  Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.
Let's go get a drink.  Unless you're scared to talk about it.
If you can't keep up, don't drink yours.
Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.
How sweet.  Is that when you put the move on her?
Little less.
What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?
We'll be loaded with 2,000 pounds of bombs and 1,500 pounds of fuel.  I got another Chinese phrase for Doolittle. "Mug wump rickshaw mushu pork."  It means "Who the fuck thought up this shit?"
Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh?
Then wh-where do we land?
Explain what?
Win?
But you're in the U.S. Army, how could you --
I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but I'm back.
I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.
Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.
It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together.
Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
He does?
That's disgusting!
You better watch out for her. She's after Charlie.
...to record how much we love each other. Sitting beside me is the cutest majorette in the history of the world. And she would Like to say something.
And nothing will ever change that.
Maybe I blocked it out.
Good.
Great, isn't it?
Come on, let's dance.
Save it.
Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.
You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.
Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.
I've got to go now.
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
Okay.
I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.
He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author — fat, violent, drunk...
Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
I shouldn't have put you through that. It must have been agony. Let's do something.
Evelyn, put her to bed.
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
Evelyn, take her to her room!
Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
Quiet today?
Yes.
That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.
The nurse called and said you'd be coming home.
Mom!
Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young.
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.
Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.
You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself.
Rosalie Testa!
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
What's inside?
So you think time travel is possible? For people?
This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
You look pretty good for a corpse.
Come on. You can't be serious.
Not for you. Okay, there's lots more.
Oh.	And huge portable radios. Everything else gets small, but for some reason, portable radios get enormous.
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
Like what?
Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
I couldn't help it —— I loved him.
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
God dammit! How'm I gonna got out of here?
You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.
Pretty much so.
How'd you know that?
I'm going out, Dad!
Is he gonna be okay?
Say your goodbyes. Zowie's going outside. You're grounded, buddy. That's the new law.
I'm not burying him here...
Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
What do you mean?
Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...  I mean... he misses you, Mom...
You'll have to get right on it, Andy, we're up against the statute of limitations.
You'll never find it in the dark.
Whacked with a racquetball.  I appreciate your faith in my abilities.
Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
So what? It's nothing to be ashamed of. You have nothing to be ashamed of, okay?
He's not sorry, okay, fine.  Why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? I'll work on getting a specimen, I'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. Okay? Everybody happy?
Bearing in mind that Bill Wright, the chairman of MacroSystems, is a close, personal friend of mine... which side of this mess would <u>you</u> desire to be on, Andy? And don't allow my very tight, personal relationship with Bill to influence your answer in any way.
A carrot?!
Don't do this, Andy.
We're waiting...
Dr. Klenstein.  It's not a pleasant procedure, but if the KS is causing the diarrhea, we ought to know right away.
He's upset, he's sorry.
Funny.
I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?
Rayisha.
Rayisha. Very nice.
Thank you.
We're friends of Beckett's.
Get it?
Charles. Okay. Miller?
What kind of person is that?
Sure thing.
What can I do?
Something like that.
Yes.
Do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks?
Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread.
Answer the question, please.
He's out in his shed showing your uncle his new riding mower.
Thanks, Mom... Dad?
Is that a question?
Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
That's correct.
We won.
In a word, yes.
... we've got a committee meeting.
Great.
Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try?  Asshole.
Not especially.
Tell Iris all about it.  Take good care of Mrs. Finley, Iris.  Beckett, come in.
Kings are out of fashion. I'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant.  It's an anti-trust action.
Andy, you don't want this.
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
Not sure. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing....
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....
Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.
Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
I got the quick-and-ugly version.
But I just wanted to say --
Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was <u>his</u> monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
Here. Make it easy on you.
Which means he went toward sunrise.
Probably right.
Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
During the landing...when things were at their worst...Owens was at his best. He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin.
I assume he licked it clean.
25 kilos each, huh?
So what happened? Where are they, then?
Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
-- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we <u>know</u> we're ready to launch.
And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?
Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact.
You coulda helped. And you didn't.
How much?
Because you're 79 kilos of gutless white meat, and <u>that's</u> why you can't come up with a better plan.
I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship.
Would you RAG YOUR STUPID HOLE!
Somethin' knocked us off-lane. Maybe a rogue comet. Maybe we'll never know.
He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall <u>at all</u>?
"Some prophet guy." And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God.
No, I'm not. But <u>he</u> can.
Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more space 'tween us and them.
I would rather we all stay--
Which half?
You mean....
I'm born-again.
Those suns gotta come back <u>sometime</u>. And if these animals really are phobic about light, we just sit tight till then.
Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?
Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.
Well, you got the big gauge.
Wanna rag your fat mouth?
Said "looks clear."
About the girl.
Like who, Mr. Chrislam?
Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations.
Remembers what?
Yo!
That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet.
Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
Huh?
I'll see.
He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
To Earth! That we've landed!
We're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth. On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion.  That could be Bellatrix.
By our time.  You've turned gray.
It's a fact, Landon. Buy it. You'll sleep better.
What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are.
I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.
Read it yourself.
With one of them.
No.
A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
Then you admit --
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.
God bless you.
He's dead! Where?... You saw him?
Yeah, they had claymores strung up in the trees, blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. BAAD SHIT.
Hey Bob, come on! Talk to me hunh, it's your friend Red, I'm only asking you for three days chief...
That reminds me, I gotta take a shit.
Yeah but I still like a piece of pussy once in a while - ain't nothing like a piece of pussy cept maybe the Indie 500.
Shit, I bet I been laid more'n you have.
Only way you'd get some pussy is your bitch dies and wills it to you - and then maybe.
Where's Elias come from?
Out there man - behind the log.
Yeah.
Then the worm has definately turned for you man.
She was a crossbreed, Chinese and Polish.
Y'ever get caught in a mistake King and you just can't get out of it?
What are you talking about! 
Maybe but I seen it happen at Ia Drang in '66, First Cavalry and they cut us to fuckin' pieces!  Give me three men, if I'm wrong, I can still roll up that flank.
He dugged his own grave.
That's what he is... Baaaa!
How far does this train go?
Well..
I think you're a nice girl. I like you. But I can read signs if the print is large enough. It was your manner more than the wedding ring that bothered the inspector.  A sort of tenseness, as if you were afraid of something.
Not tonight.
I'm sure you have.
Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock?  A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.
I haven't been invited.
Nobody I'd rather have on a leash.
Okay. You win.
If I change my mind.
Maybe you're going to have to like me.
How long would that take?
Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time.
Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
Would it make you anymore amusing?
I didn't say anything.
How did you meet him?
He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
You didn't have to tell him that.
Dance? Tonight?
Is this the best you can do?
So have I.
There's another man--right outside the booth here.  I never saw him Before.
Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.
How bad is it?  Bad enough for-- 
They'll look for you.
But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.
It did, but it never paid off-- until now.  I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway.
Go down into the cabin and get yourself a drink.  Careful how you go, we're hitting the swell now.
That's right.
I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune.  Most of it pretty dirty money.  I don't care to have that known.
Larry Mitchell found out.  So you killed him.
What your father did doesn't condemn you.
He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money.
Yes.  Yours.  You haven't murdered anybody.  You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident?  It must have been.  If you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.
But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.
If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself?  Oh, I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick.  When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it, I've been skating close to it for quite some time.  The water is cold down there--  But so is everything else.  And there's you.
Beer?  Well, all right.
Right, Miss.
I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am.
Miss Mayfield, the humor of the situation escapes me. Within 24 hours I shall know officially whether Mitchell was murdered. Privately, I'm quite sure of it now. It happened in your room, and you came to Vancouver with him.. At any rate, he made your hotel reservation.. And you arrived together. Here in this room he behaved nastily to you, and you said something to him which might be taken as a threat.  A few hours later he was found dead on your balcony. Would it be too much too suggest that all these circumstances taken together are a little suspicious?
You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
That's an evasion and you know it.
There's the clear mark of a wedding ring on your finger.
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
Would you be satisfied if I said I shot him?
They're all crude, when they don't work. Had breakfast?
Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
The police always do, don't they?
Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.
Time's up.  I'm off the case. 
I hope he can prove it.  Come on. You don't want to get pneumonia.
All right. Get him.
Who's Goble?
I'm not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me.
What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign.
Why not here?
In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.
Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.
On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.
Quite sure you had no motive?
I rather thought so. And before that, had you ever seen the gun?
We do, when we get the chance.
I don't.
Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.  How long since you saw her?
Would that make me a heel?
Your concentrating too hard, Killaine.  What about Margo West? She had a motive.  I guess you know by this time whose gun it was?
You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?
See how easy it is? Perhaps Miss Mayfield left her door unlocked. Or if she didn't, there's a passkey on every floor in the linen room. The head porter has a passkey. The bell captain has a passkey. The hotel's full of passkeys.
He saw my face too.
Not a floater.  Only just dead.
Send that?
Thanks, Inspector.  What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
Magruder's conked out.  Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent.  He may come out of it and he may not.  As a source of quick information, we can't forget him.
The joint's not open, Mac.  Who's Brandon?
Go live in a tent.
I've always looked forward to it. All right, let's get him out of here and tidy up.
I'll know when I find it.
Gigi, huh?  Sounds French--one of those fancy ladies.  Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold.
They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?
Do I know who lives down there?
Well.  What about it?
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
How about Magruder?
So far.
It won't look pretty good on your record, Killaine.  Where's the girl now?
Ye have, have ye?
But you still think she's innocent.
Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
This badge is not an old newspaper you can cast down on the desk.  It is not a thing you can give up as of no value.  It may be taken from you--and you may die defending it. But you'll not use it to make cheap dramatic gesures with.  It's a naked steel of the sword of Justice.  Put it back in your pocket and hold tight to it--and someday you might grow into a worthiness ye lack now.
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
You ought to know why.
Splendid. Now she can return the compliment.
You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
In an hour, Larry.
Be nasty.
It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
I think you'll do very well.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
Not too bad, thanks.  How have you been?
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
...break away completely from--
...from all the moralising and talk of national humiliation that is now the standard line on Suez...
Yes, please.
That must be rather nice, in a way.  I mean, you don't have any--
I think she liked me.
No jokes.  James is in love.
You're so gross.
Sorry.  Got held up.  What are you doing here?
Oh she knows you're very busy, especially now, with everything going on...the doctor said to try her on solids, but she's been right off her food...You take this up to her.  Tell her you made it.  She'll like that.
It's because he desires you.  The women get all the breaks at these conferences.
Tom . .. bed!  Go on.
Two years of surgery.  I missed my window.  Limped through law school instead.
Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?
No.  So I was up the beach.  I saw it going down.  you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world.
Once.
Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play.
Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
Good guess.  There's a gun on you right now.
You gotta tell me where she is.
Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
You never were...
There's nobody else here...
Yes, sir.
What?
What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
Cole and Munoz.  I'm uh... letting them run with the ball for a while.
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
Welcome to Sea World, kid.
Reagan usually drives.  Stolen switch car, they leave it running at the curb, looks parked from a distance.  When they run, they dump the vehicle and vanish.  And I mean vanish.
Forget about it, kid.  They're ghosts.  Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it.  See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile, right?  They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public.  Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau, right?
Yeah.  What's your theory?
Thanks for the tip.  I needed this knowledge.
It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?  This was your lame-o idea in the first place.  You gotta back me up on this.
Okay, Dad.
Angelo, we gotta talk.
Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right?  But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?
Sure.
He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride.
Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a higher plane of existence, or something.  Maybe he has.  You've seen him surf... that frenzy.  It seems like anger.  It's not.  It's the energy of lovemaking.  The sea is the woman in his life.  She's his only true lover.
What are you talking about?
No.  I'm sorry.  I have to go. I'll, uh... I'll call you later. I'm sorry.
Six others, U.S. issue jungle boots. They came in from the north, then followed the guerrillas.
You never did know when to quit.
Also heard that you passed on that little job in Libya.
You never were all that smart... let's go!!!
Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time.
You know you can't win this one.
Right behind you.
Anytime.
I'll take him.
It's been a long time, General.
Hawkins?
Where the hell is his body?
No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town?
He's not really my uncle.
Twenty-five percent.
Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?  Uhm... how're... business things going.
No.
Storage, I think.
Not with those smokestacks it's not.
You what?
Of course, yes.  After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
You're making the right decision, sir.
What's that?
Sure.  For five bucks.
Sit... and spin.
No.
New York.
You like being a hooker, Vivian?
So do day jobs.
Day jobs, yeah.  I've tried them.  Turn right.
You don't know habits, you think this is ugly.
For an hour.
You're joking.
I never joke about money.
You mean they don't have hookers.
-- and a bowl of strawberries. Thank you.
No?  Why's that?
Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
I'm in town until Saturday.
But you want days too.
Three.
Did you buy some clothes?
You're forgiven.
Some game.  Screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement.
Ready to stomp sod?
Vivian, what the --
I really am sorry.
Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know.  That's the fun of it.
Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
I'm sorry.  That's very sweet, Edward, and I know you mean it...
I know.  Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being stupid.  I'll think about it, okay?  It's a real good offer for a whore.
Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
Right.
It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all.
You shouldn't go alone.  He might claim that you tried to black mail him.
The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions.
Doing what?
Hear me out.  I've known you a long time.  I see a difference in you this week.  Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross.
You're being ridiculous.
We'll be there.  Listen, if he's really caving in, we'll go from there down to the office.  I want him to commit his stock to us this morning.
Yes.
Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.
Baby!  Rodeo Drive.
He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
So did I.  I made it with the principal.  Study hard And get a "B."  Lift your dress and an "A" you'll see.
Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
Don't give me that.  Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.
I'm -- I'm with a friend.
They were real nice to me there. They treated me, y'know... nice. Thanks, Barney.
Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.
Certain ladies make that very easy... Vivian.  John, call a limousine for our guest, please.  Have it take her anywhere she wishes to go.  Bill the hotel.  See you again sometime soon.
Yes...
I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
I was in here yesterday.
I just might do that.
May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
Of course.
I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-
I do not marry tonight.
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
I will never doubt again.
It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.
You never said anything about killing anyone.
Am I going mad or did the word "think" escape your lips? You were not hired for your brains, you hippopotamic land mass.
Anybody want a peanut?
What do I do?
Yes, some of the time. 
What's the difference?  We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
Right, right, sorry.
What?
Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
Do you want me to go on with this?
All right, then. No more interruptions.  ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.
-- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up.
I don't mind so much.
It will not happen!
I always think everything could be a trap -- Which is why I'm still alive.
Oh, I know. The people are quite taken with her. It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, I thought that was clever. But it's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. They'll demand we go to war.
-- anything you want --
I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!
Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
Sixty-five.
Are you a rotten liar.
Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. Except for a nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. They're so perky, I love that. But that's not what he said. He distinctly said "to blave." And, as we all know, "to blave" means "to bluff." So you're probably playing cards, and he cheated
Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.
No good. I've known too many Spaniards.
I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro.
I am not left-handed.
No one of consequence.
Get used to disappointment.
That would be inconceivable.
You're sure nobody's following us?
There will be no arrangement --  -- and you're killing her!
Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
What you do not smell is called iocane powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man.
A good hour. Yeah.
I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...
"I want to croon,
Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ...
According to the backer's list you raised $60,000.  But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.  There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.
It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom, look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning.  Other men sail through life.  Bialystock has struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going under.  I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure.  Bloom, I'm reaching out to you.  Don't send me to jail.  Help!  Help!
Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made your error.  You didn't go all the way.  You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.
Poppea.  She was his wife.  And she was unfaithful to him.  So he got mad and he jumped on her.  Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.  Please don't jump on me.
It's a little better, but you still look angry.
They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.
Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
OI.  I'm depressed.  Leo, do me a favor.  Open the safe.  I want to see the money.
I'm going to buy a toy.  I worked very, very hard and I think I deserve a toy.
I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work.
Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
Why don't we go over to the theatre and see what's really happening? After all, we've only heard from a small portion of the audience. Let's hear what the majority thinks.
Shut up.
Mr. Liebkind, wait.  You don't understand.
Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."
No kidding?
That's exactly why we want to do this play.  To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart. 
Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory.
I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a demon.  It's a gargoyle, it's a monster... but it's still my child.
Rudolfo, you dirty pig!  Pull over.
The Graf Spee...
The Graf Spee...
The Blue Max...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
Heil you know who!
Vat?
In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  This used to be the main highway.  Want to register, please?
I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble.
No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
Tell me all about her.
She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.
Very early. Dawn.
I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.
Anyone at home?
Someone is sitting in that window.
My mother.
That's all right. maybe she could have fooled me.  But...  She didn't fool my mother.
No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...
All right!  Might save me a lot of leg-work if I could just talk to your mother.  But I'd need a warrant for that, won't I?
What are you talking about?  What is this?
Sam, if she's here...
How much?
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
Buzz me the minute she comes in.
Like what?
Your Detective told you a nakedfaced lie.
Just what he told your detective.
With you.
Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing.
I was getting to that!
I hate tears. 
Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?
I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
Where's the old highway?
Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
Sam.
Where could he have gone?
She was willing to lick the stamps.
This is the old highway.
She always tries to be proper.
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?
How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
What makes you sound so certain?
We could laze around here a while longer.
Sure. It's like laughing through a broken jaw, but...
I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  Next best thing to no conscience at all.
We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!
You make respectability sound... disrespectful.
I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
I haven't even been married once yet!
Sam, let's go get married.
I'm thinking of it.
I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.
Am I that close to Fairvale?
Then will you do me a favor?  Will you have supper here?  I was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... I don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey.
Not really. I hear that expression, that one eats "like a bird," is really a falsie, I mean a falsity, because birds eat a tremendous lot.  Oh, I don't know anything about birds. My hobby is stuffing things... taxidermy. And I guess I'd just rather stuff birds because...  well, I hate the look of beasts when they're stuffed, foxes and chimps and all... some people even stuff dogs and cats... but I can't... I think only birds look well stuffed because they're rather...  passive, to begin with... most of them...
I'm looking for a private island.
I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
Oh I do... but I say I don't. 
No, not like me.
I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring...
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
Now wait just a moment! Turn your motor off, please.
I'm sorry.
Let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking.
Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
Bates' Motel.  He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam.
It ain't only local history, Sam, it's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself.  Strychnine. Ugly way to die.
Uh, uh! My boss is paying for this trip... ninety percent business... and he wants practically notarized receipts. I better sign in and get a receipt.
That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?
Just an expression...  What I meant was... I'd do just about anything... to get away.  Wouldn't you?
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
Okay--I'll be here at eight.
Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?
Sure, got thousand cats, too. Look at 'em-- Points to cages of cats.
He isn't here.
You're losing your blood?
A voice ...
In the can.  The hoosegow! Mrs. Winton's little boy. The Pawk Avenue Wintons, you know ... and plenty of do-re-mi.  He's in the jail-house now ...
I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
I don't agree with you.
No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.
Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?
I'd love to, at any time.
They are.  My boy, I think you are right. Everyone is tired out today and now that we have seen my doors open in a new country, I am beginning to realize that I am a little tired myself. You can call that fellow in from the front. I think we'll close for the night.
Are you giving me this straight?
I'm glad to hear it. When did you go in for crusading in the cause of justice? This lousy mug, with all the money in the world, has had two or three nasty affairs. He's kept out o' print because his great- grandfather was smarter than the Indians.
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
Get out of here.
All right, Master Mind.  But there's something cockeyed about that joint and I'm going to find out what it is. 
That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in South America.
Almost! I'll still bet I'm right, and let you write your own ticket.
Yes, you could. Cut out this rotten business and act like a lady. Marry me.
Where were you going when you got in that cab?
Do you know George Winton?
That's the one.
They don't suspect <I>him</I>?
He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
Plain-clothes man.  Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death.
For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
That happens to be the truth.
That's what they're going to ask you.
What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
Heaven knows. A lot.
Is that a fact?
Everything, my friend. And you hope to be a great sculptor --  A great sculptor. Look -- this forearm is at least two inches too long.
You have done well, and now I, too, have something for you. Come.
I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
You did.
That's the physicist's playground.
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
That's what it asked me.  "What do you want?"  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment.
Inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier...
Then you get it.  You'll understand.
So I can move on.  You too.
I know, Mother.
There was this old man that ate his niece.
Well, all right.
Aw, be a good sport, Rose.  You like me, don't you? I like you a lot.
Who would want to do such a thing as that?
Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you.
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
Oh, Buddy, you do love me! I knew you did, knew it all the time...
Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But later on after Momma died and Daddy wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin', I sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew. You know, I oughtn't to of told you about what Daddy done when I was a child. Until them rabbits ruined him, he was a real good man, Buddy.
Buddy, sex don't mean a thing to me. It ain't nothin' but a mosquito bite.  I'll tell you a secret. Girls don't want sex, Buddy, girls want love.
I do, too!
No, she hasn't.  I think I hear a car.
What did you say, Brother?
Oh, yes, it's Thursday.  Hello, Rose, dear...  ... my, you're... looking pretty...
Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this.
Let's go peep from the living room.
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
What are they doing, Doll?
You know, Buddy, sometimes you make me sick.
You better not snoop, Daddy'll kill you!
Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?
A baby... and she isn't even married.
That's the least of her troubles. Rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up, she told me all about it.
If it isn't a baby... what is it?
Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
Oh, I heard from her, I got a letter from her, she's fine. But there is some sad news.
You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.
I'm older than hell, boy. But this Yankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll say that.
But... but how? She was young! Rose wasn't old!
I'm not blubbering.
Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.
He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.
Well, she loves children, all right.  She loves everybody.
Quarter of twelve.
Is she all right?
Yes, darlin', time will tell.
Rose, my patience is wearing thin. First a scruffy man who runs like a deer and now a sulky boy who wont go away. This is getting to be a regular monkey and dog show.
Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?
And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!
I said I don't intend to fire her. I just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth, that's all.
Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her.
Who is to say our morals are better than hers?  But maybe you're right. She could... influence Dolly...
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
Just a minute, Rose, you don't understand. This isn't a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it's nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it's not a farm, damn it, it's a beautiful dairy establishment! Stop crying, Rose! Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's ideal!
I don't know how you can call it ideal -- don't you know what the word "farm" means to her?
I am poleaxed and in a non compos mentis condition. I wash my hands or the whole thing.
You don't know where you're going?
Now Rose, stop behaving as if you're Bo Peep. Those men had a flight last night because of some female in this house, and it wasn't Dolly or Mrs. Hillyer.
I'm not hungry.
Yes, sir.
Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?
Yes, sir.
Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!
Well. What kinda job is it?
Mine.
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
Page proof of a book I'm working on.
Oh, yeah?
I see. Outside it.
Mother, Buddy says Rose got in his bed last night and he fiddled with her and she snorted and had a fit -- and he says I would too if I was grown-up. Is it true, Mother -- would I sweat and snort and froth at the mouth and have a horrible fit like he says?
It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth.
I beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do you mean "epi-zoo-ot-tics," an animal epidemic?
Gonorrhea?
What do you mean, what kind of gobbledygook talk is that?
Mrs. Hillyer, this girl is sick in more ways than one. She is an extreme psychoneurotic with uncontrollable sexual impulses. It would be a mercy to spare her the suffering she causes herself and others. Therefore I recommend as a therapeutic measure the removal of her second ovary. It is ethically and medically the only proper decision in this case and I suspect your husband agrees with me.
Oh, Mother, cut it out.
Well, it's rather interesting about Brother, actually. I realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old. He looked at me and understood me, he knew exactly who I was. I know it sounds crazy but it's true. He's very remarkable, he was born for the ministry and could move millions, but he doesn't know that yet. I have to warn you about him, he can be very dangerous, there is an evil streak in him, a streak of pure sheer meanness. But at heart Brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesn't know it.
More history, Rose.
Yes, Ma'am.
It'll get better now.
What and?  That's what I got.
Just entering.  We'll get to the breaking in a minute.
I need the "when" and the "where."
Lay off once, would you?
Jeez... it's too early in the morning for this.  Leave off.  Here's your paper.
Move it!
Relax.
Hands off the suit, monkey-boy. Close your eyes if you're scared.
Well... we shouldn't rush into this, right?  Let's talk about it.
You don't smoke.
Bullshit.
We have to find Kittle.
We've got the tape to prove it.
There was a time when you did things the right way, till you hooked up with that fat-assed-boozehound and the soul-sister.
Thank you for sharing that charming image.
You bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it.  And for what, Kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? Tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?
You think you accomplished something... like you're heroes? Fuck you!   This is meaningless! You'll never win!  You know, as soon as I'm gone... someone's going to take my place.
Whoops... don't mind me.  Go ahead and finish up.
Absolutely.
Can't be worse than you.
I kinda already figured that, but keep those helpful hints coming.
Nothing's broke.  Keep sewing.  And quit pacing, you big ox.  You're making me skittish.
Beholden to none.
I don't think so.
That's the problem with expensive tastes... the more you got, the more you got to lose.
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
Yoda spoke of another.
Your eyesight will return in time.
Where am I?
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
Luke!
Fine. Together again, huh?
Quietly, there might be more of them out there.
We got separated.
Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.
Ahhh...
Hold me.
Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way.
Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
Come on! Come on!
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for...
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
Disintegrated?
On my mother's grave.
Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
So please don't tell me to can it.
Made me give you the eye And then panic,
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
I've got something to say.
Oh Brad.
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
It's alright Janet.
It's alright Janet.  Everything's going to be alright.
Yes.
A decision had to be made.
So come up to the Lab.
Now I
The delivery boy.
My mother told me just the opposite. She said, 'You weren't born with much of a body so you'd better develop your brain.'
After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare.
Yes, I do.
Ya right --  Mebbe we best just hold hands -- the shirt made me feel guilty, y'know.
...What's to say? I dunno what he wants from me --
Apollo?
Paul.
Get away from me -- I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself! So instead I put you two together -- Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me? -- You owe me!
Owe you what?
You's the novelty, Champ!
I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop 'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.' Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn monster movie!!
You're hurtin', man!
One more round.
...Thanks.
Of wa?
Kiss my ass.
Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still fight. Kinda do it like a hobby. See I'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward -- Southpaw means lefthanded... But I guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best, right?
Charge it.
I only wonder if this man has the skill to go past three rounds -- Vegas odds say, 'no.'
Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.
Creed is down!!!
Not only has he refused to fall, but he has beaten the Champion's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest.
That's it, I'm broke.
Ya still light seventy.
A few bucks.
I'm gonna do somethin with it.
Mr. Balboa --
Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
Then stand there an' wait till I'm done -- Creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but I gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ -- He's mean, quick, an' big -- What more d'ya need? Okay, go to work...  Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?
Twenty-five, thirty -- What's the difference? -- It took me two months to learn the combination of that locker.
Did ya win?
Ya puttin' me on?
When was they here?
...Ya gave Dipper my locker.
Would you keep goin'?
Creed's great.
'Bout what?
Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me.
Ya always in a bad mood --
...Adrian ain't sharp.
...Sure.
Look at my hands -- See how the joints are swollen.
I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.
Keep this job, ya eat better.
Christ, I been beggin' ya for a break until I'm sick inside.
Creed's great, ain't he... I'll do what I can.
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
A tweeting bird?
Is this paper even good?
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
Then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open.
Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
Ask her...
What the hell's a freeway?
Uh, Eddie, do me a favor.  Could you sit in the back so you won't cause as much of a commotion.
Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
I'm not complainin'.  But give me credit.  I'm the guy who took the pictures of you and Acme playin' pattycake, remember?
It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.
Doom.
So's the job.
Yeah, but I enlarged this one.  Thought you might be interested.
Well, everybody needs a hobby.
Take it easy.
Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
Drink it, jerk.  All of it.
Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
A Toon?  Noooo.
Get away from there.
Forget it.
How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.
Why, what is Tybalt?
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
He shall be endured
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter now. We must entreat the time alone.
Benedicite! What early tounge so sweet saludeth me?
I pray thee, chde me not; whom I love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow; the other did not so.
Farewell.
O, mighty is the powerful grace that lies in plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities: for nought so vile that the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give, nor aught so good, but strain'd from that fair use revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse: virtue itself turns vice, being misaplied; and vice sometimes by action dignified. Within the infant rind of this weak flower poison is resident and medicine power: for this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; being tasted, slays all senses with the heart. Two such empossed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs, grace and rude will; and where the worser is predominant, full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
Where is my Lady's lord?
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.
Amen
What?
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
You kiss by the book.
She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men's noses as they lie asleep; Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is she--This is she!
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
A most courteous exposition.
Here's goodly gear!
Courage man, the hurt can not be much.
This is important.
Of course.
The name is Deirdre, and I'm running this show.
Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
Nothing.
Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in here!
Ready when you are...
I'm touched, really, that they'd send someone of your caliber.  It's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice.
What do you mean?
I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we see what we can do for you?
Yeah.
You seem one to me.
All in the stomach, though.  Your man might live.
Is that right?
Everybody.
It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
I don't think so.
And I suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?
I don't.  But the language he's speaking is universal.
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
What's the difference?
I wanted to see who you were.
Who am I?
I just wanted to see something.
You weren't around when I woke up, I thought maybe something had happened.  This has been one very fucked up job, Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances on anybody...  Including you...
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
You might be a hired gun, Vincent, but I got a feeling you cost more than two bits.
Not necessarily.  He could go off road at any number of places.  He might not even be in the country anymore.
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
I'm going with you.
You see the bullet?
I know of him.
It's my job.
Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.
You would have done that?
Business keeps you on the road?
Looks like some kind of drug deal or something, they're not from around here --  one of them's still alive.
I don't know what you're -
I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
Cash and what?
We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
We don't know that.
We'll figure something out.
Because...I know.
Torch it?!
Okay then.  I'll do it.
That's not what I mean.
Well, we didn't know that at the time.
All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
Forget the copies!  He could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original.
He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not.
Not bad enough to kill him.
You killed him...
Yes I DO!  It never woulda stopped, you know that.  Jesse's always gonna be making mistakes and we'd be paying for them for the rest of our lives.
I know, I know.  Dwayne's dead, but we can deal with it.  We'll pin it on him.  The DEA was driving Jesse's car. No car phone.  No radio.  They couldn't have called me in.
It's not about the money anymore. Can't you see that?  It's about
I can't.  I can't go on.  I can't keep lying...killing.  That's not me.  That's not US.
My point, well...
What's your offer, Jesse?
Two thousand...
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
Hello.
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
I know.
You deserve it is the occasion.
Nothing happened?
He's not, he's...
And I'd take it out on him.
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
I love you Sally.
Sally there's a whole world out there.  We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump.  What are you giving up?
I have a better plan.
What?
First you question my integrity, then you call me stupid...  ...that hurts, son.
So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!
Well I don't know...
Hmmm...
C?
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
All right you’re the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
Dammit you’re persistent.  I don’t want to listen to this anymore.  No more bets with you.
A surprise huh?  Well I don't like any surprises, especially if I'm forking over the loot for them!
Watch that.  Watch that tone.
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
Shut up!!!  Slut!!!
Listen -
I was on a roll!  I’m a little overextended now.
Is that the mail?
Are you hungry?
That's great Earl!
Give me the bad news.
Those are five hundred dollar chips.
So tell me what you know.
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
This is your ship?
How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm -- and don't let the robe fool you.  This is the only color they had left.  Now get up!
Lee, you okay?
Oh yes, she's very nice.
I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights.
You better take one.  Your breath has been a little funky all day.  Let me look at you.
Take this.  It's a Magnum.  You can fold it in half.
Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?
Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!
How you doin'?
My friend is on vacation, from America. I want to show him a good time.
Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.
Ask me if I give a shit.
I thought you'd think it was crazy.
Why LA?
Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.
How do you know he's our man?
Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
The same place you find all RichWhiteMen.  Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love this stuff.  Here, try it with a smear.
How do you know?
The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
No.  It was my singing.
Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you.
She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
I don't need a turn!
Take it!
We can help you.  I'm a detective in Hong Kong.
They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.
Shhh, my head hurts.
I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you.
See you in the next world.
No.
You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
Are you serious?
Go ahead.  Sing your ass off.
Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.
I'll give it my best shot.
Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!
Come on, Lee.  Stop being a cop for five minutes and live it up.  There must be something you want.
First class.
What "revenge" is he talking about?
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
No.  It's a sample.  You guys ever heard of the Superbill?
Yes.  They've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars, and there's only one way to spot a fake.
If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.
I still have my lunch money from third grade.
Let him find out on his own.  I want the Hong Kong police handling this.
You must come with me for questioning.
Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong.
Tell me why they killed the customs agents.
It's a massage parlor downtown.  "Heaven on Earth."  You will find your answers there.
Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What you're seeing here?  This is not movement. This is my "still".
The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.
Don't push it. You better watch your ass with these Fed types. If there's a screw-up, they won't think twice about burnin' it.
Let me give you a piece of advice: never touch another man's radio. You do it again, nobody, not Rhonda, not Yolanda, gonna save your ass.
Well don't do that.  Polite don't work here.  You do that polite shit here in America, they'll sue your ass for harassment.
Wait. You hungry?  You gotta be hungry, you just flew in from China. And what'd they feed you, Chinese food, right?  Then you gotta be hungry.  Hell, it doesn't matter, I'm hungry.  We'll get some food on the way to the Consulate.
What plate?
The license!  You get it?!
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
No, no.  I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas.  Œscuse me.
Yes, I think so.
No, fish is a PM food.
I am from outa town.
Oh yes.
Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now.
You know him?
Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
I could get promoted right out of here.
What's wrong with that?
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...
He is the situation.
Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese --
Don't play bullshit games with me.
You a cop or something?
What are you talking about?
Ambassador Han.
Yes.
Even if you deny the FBI is there, I will assume you are lying.
Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
I was trying to find the right time.
So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
God bless you, Maggie.
Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
Bob is making her visualize the ceremony.
"Sink the putt."
"Make the shot."
"Never say die."
I'm sorry, Ike.  This is permanent.
Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..."  Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison.
Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
I don't think that's why she ran.
No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.
Oh, please!
Ah, beautiful.  I just can't see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that.
Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it.  The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.
Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.
Yes.
You humiliated me!
Well, they should.  Because they're about to watch you hang yourself again.
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
I kissed him back.
A little longer for me.
Really?
So am I.
I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I?  But I can't speak for Italics.  Traitor!
They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
This is getting serious.
Yup!
Ya think?
Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus.
What happened at the luau?
That's good.
He's got a houseboat.
They're going to love you.
Go for a walk in Central Park --
Oh, it's just Becky, she's having trouble with Rich again.  Hold on, Becky, I'm going downstairs.
Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
Okay, okay.
I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
It was my mother's.
What was what?
Not.
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
What?
Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.
Thank you.  I love you.
He said hello.
I love the symphony.
No, I know that part --
Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.
I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter.  It's quite a formal name, isn't it?  One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it --
Magic.
Hi.  So far so good.  So.  What should we talk about? How insecure we were in high school.  Shirley Votypka, the first girl I ever felt up. Health.  What about health? Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?
The one in the street.  I chased after you.
Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone.
Who is this?
What kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio?
No.
Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
It's Y. O. H.
What?!
Oh, you're changing your mind --
What?
Somewhere in the middle.
What?
Whose show was this on?
Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
What was?
Bye bye blackbird.
WAIT!!!  -- "and while we're on the subject, let's just say right now that Brooks Robinson was the best third baseman ever. It's important that you agree with me on that because I'm from Baltimore."  Dad, she thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
Was Mom an adjustment?
This is the one I like.
It was all they had.
Hi.  Sam?
Now that I'm seeing someone, it's a whole other thing.
Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?
Why didn't you give a warning signal?
Now don't get excited, Mr. Alexander. They'll scatter like a covey of quail.
No, just the ring leaders. The fire-eaters. And the ones with big families ...  Barton -- where's that boy?
It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.
Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?
Yes. We will light the candles.
What has it got me, your union?
I'm a fool.
Because if we lose, we lose more than a strike. We lose the union. And the men know this. And if we win, we win more than a few demands. We win...  ... something bigger. Hope. Hope for our kids. Juanito can't grow strong on milk alone.
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
But the motion passed. It's ... it's not democratic of you to ...
Backward.
All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
Sure, the standby squad. Stand-by for the funeral.
Whose funeral? We're doing all right. There hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days.
Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
Okay, so discrimination hurts the Anglo too, but it hurts me more. And I've had enough of it!
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
You know I don't think that.
No. New York.
I thought maybe you forgot...
Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
No, Why?
Get used to it.  You're in a very tenuous position on the food chain, hoss.
I'll see you tonight.
I was thinking Alice Cooper.
How far out of town?
Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
And you admire that?
It's the only way to play.
Nothing.
They would have killed you too.
You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.
Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.  Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?
You don't say.
I'm serious, dude.  You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'.
Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
I know a buyer.  Guy's looking for a quarter's worth.
No. I'm good.
Was he the president?
I don't trust anybody.
You might as well be spitting on her grave every time you put drugs up your nose.  Or did you just conveniently forget that it was drug dealers who killed my daughter?
The good stuff.  Can you handle that?
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
Hey, I don't play that.
Big Bill.
Big Bill
Okay! Okay!
No one. It was just a test. I need to be sure of who I'm dealing with from time-to-time.
I was trying to score some dope.
Who is it?
Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
I still don't know what you're talking about.
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?
I thought you were done.
A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.
Fourty-four, twenty one dead.
You writin' a book or somethin'?
You must be a hell a shot.
You take account of the wind?
Shut up, will you?
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
I mean, Ryan, what do you think of him?
Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.
Senator's son?
On the other side of the street, crouches in a doorway with Jackson. Upham is a bit in shock, less from the nearness of the bullets than from what Miller just did for him.
Pass.
Sure, you got one?
There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
What about the company?
Simpson?  Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick!
Tell that to Private James Ryan. We've got our orders.  Let's go.
Is it getting worse?
Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another BURST.  KILLS the last of the German riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto the field.
But, sir...
There's to be a bright side, look for it.
Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.
Well, I, for one, like cheese.
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
I'll make a note of your suggestions but I'll leave that last one to you, especially if he's already dead.
I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.
You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.
No, I just happen to take the Captain's advice and look at the bright side of things.
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
Lingerie.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
How can you, how can you say that?
Mr Court, be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates...
Hmmm.  Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
Hey, bad throat, huh J-man?
I was hilarious once, wasn't I?
Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.
Okay, I got it.
See you.  Bye.  Bye Diane.
Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.
I am.
I just saw Joe.  He's here.
And I want to turn the home over to the state.
I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
I'm sorry.
You won it.  You're going to study at the finest institute at England, the toughest fellowship in the country, and you won.
Goodnight.
Now why can't I tell the story?
Which they did.  Let me finish.
Do you wanna make things easier on me?  Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit.  You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.
'I like him'?  Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...
Well then don't pick it up. You know what's best.
But I found the money.
No, but you stole from them.
I'm so ashamed dad.
If we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier.  You know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do?
Look at those eyes.
Thank you very much.
So you're monumentally busy?
I'll go.
Eight.
No.
Basic.  Hmmm.
Or, or I could always wear this one.
Mmmm.
Yes.  Are you shaking?
What's wrong?
Okay, how much time do you need?  I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions. 
'Cause I'm worried, did you just break up with me?
Did you talk to Corey?
I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?
Okay.
Alright, personalised flight care from Corey.  Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?
I know.
Hey man, I was in love once.  I got hurt really bad.  I never wanna go through that again.
Work that jab, work that hook, work that jab, okay, take a break, take a break.
The guy with the Datsun?
Uh, no, not really, no actually, basically, you don't know me. I'm a friend of your daughters; well I sat with her yesterday at the mall.
Yeah.  Honey?
It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'.  Read that.
Just her name.
How ya doin' Miss Evans?
What?
This is great, this gives me hope.  Thanks.
You know Diane Court?
You must chill!  You must chill!  I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
Now you're back.
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
I pay you too much.
It's good for me - I know them, I'm familiar with them.  It's good for you - you'll be compensated.  It's good for the Army.  You know what I'm going to make?  Artillery shells.  Tank shells. They need that.  Everybody's happy.
I work hard for you.  I'll continue to work hard for you.
God bless you, sir.
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
Better this month than last?
It's dangerous.  It's dangerous, to me, personally.
Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...
Broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. This is too much fun for one person.
It's hell week. Chill. The movie murders have brought out the crazies. It's nothing.
I can't believe you're alone in that house.
What if I said goodbye?
Can we talk?
Where is Sidney's father?
Why don't you ask them?
Let us decide that.
No, it's not.
I didn't say she was alone. That guy-- from her home town showed up. They went off together.
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
You’d me amazed at how many of us there are out there. It’s a whole world, Sid. You’re really popular amongst the demented.
Tuition’s expensive.
Miss Weathers.
Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
..and as lonely as I am...
Don't worry...
You're getting obvious.
The safety what? Fuck that!
Too bad.
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
No, no, I hadn't planned on going, it's just Mickey will be pissed.
Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised.
The knife slices into Maureen again...then again. The theatre audience is starting to take note as the Ghost keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife. A horrifying, sickening sight.
Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly,  Eight thirty.
Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are. Look, my battery's dying . . .
Hello.
Wait, wait. Don't hang up.
Really? You're such a talented actor.
Now let's see you act your way out of this one.
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
What?! But I did everything you said to do!
What?!
Very good. You follow directions well. Now for the final part of the game. Put down the bat and approach the sign, slowly.
Closer than you think.
Reaction to what?
I'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe you've heard of me?
Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president?
Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.
Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
You mean like, movie trilogies?
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you see what I see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. I think you know about that.
I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.
Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen.
This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a month? L.A Forever?
It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!
What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
I already removed it.  I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.
Gale, your engine's still running.
Gale Weathers would find a way. 
Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here? No press on the set!  No press, no press on set! Get that woman out of here.
All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
But you know my favorite name?
And still the film is Number One at the box office this weekend. Beat out American Pasty and Arlington Street.
Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
Go there.
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
I'm sorry, your voice.
And if you get it right -- you die.
You know what time it is, Sid? It's after midnight. It's your mother's anniversary. We killed her exactly one year ago today.
She looked dead. Still does.
What are you doing here?
Oh it did?
Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television.
Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
Are you serious?
When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
Uh-huh.
We already played that game. You lost, remember?
Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?
I don't know.
They've got 900 numbers for that. Seeya.
Why don't you want to talk to me?
I don't think so.
Just some scary movie.
Sure...
I'm getting scared.
That all depends on you.
Turn off the light.
NOOOO....
No it's not. It was Jason.
Lucky, for you there's a bonus round. But poor Steve... I'm afraid... he's out.
Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study I proved to be most popular amongst males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. Does the force require that you work out?
We're tracking the cellular phone bill.
We haven't ruled out that possibil...
Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling.
Yeah.
You think he could still be in town?
Yes, sir.
I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.
If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
Kenny. Camera. Now.
And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
Many times.
Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
He was drunk that night. He left his coat at your house, after your mother seduced him...
I saw him leaving wearing it.
Ricki Lake.
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
So where are you?
Can you knock?
I heard screaming.
...so call if you need me.
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
Did you really put her liver in the mailbox? I hear they found her liver in the mailbox.
She's saving herself for you.
Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
I can cry on cue.
Wanna another beer?
Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one.
The official term is "psychotic".
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
Tell your mom I said thanks.
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
He was there, Tatum.
How does that get you in the mood with Stu?
Okay, but whatever you did -- the entire student body thanks you.
He's not finished.
Okay...
I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?
It's not too far away now.
Spit it out.
We would have gotten you eventually.
And I wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a dead man who wasn't really dead until Davis was in the car calling it in and eating a donut.
No one yet.
No.
I read.  Remember reading?
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
Well, his body was found Monday night, okay?  But, get this... the office was closed all day Monday.  Which means, as long as the gluttony killing was done before the weekend, our killer could've gotten in here on Friday.  He could've spent all day Saturday with Gould, and all day Sunday.
Forced what?
Totally unrelated victims.
And?
It was my first one of these.  We were a secondary unit, and I was pretty shaky going in.  I was still considered a rookie.
Sounds like he knew what he was talking about.
A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.
No.  He's not depending on luck.  You've seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day.  To the day! Because he wanted us to.
Him?
The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.
Think it through.  If we leave a hole like this, we'll never prosecute.  He'll walk.  We have to come up with some excuse for knocking on this door.
Okay... okay... get off.
Then, he must write about these murders.
Sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.
One birthday he gave me this brand new hardcover book, "The Century of the Detective," by Jurgen Thorwald.  It traced the history of deduction as a science, and it sealed my fate, because it was real, not fiction.  And, that a drop of blood or a piece of hair could solve a crime... it was incredible to me.
You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.
Listen to yourself.  You say, "the problem with people is they don't care, so I don't care about people."  But, you're already here.  You've been here a long time.  So, there's a part of you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it matters.
You and I are, probably for the first time ever, in total agreement.  He wouldn't just stop.
He's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right?  Can you even conceive of what's going to happen next?  I mean, can you even imagine how he'll try to finish it?
Slut.
There's no time to discuss it!
Please, I need you to help me if we're going to get who did this.
I guess I won't be showing it to him then.
You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
He mentioned it.
Crime of passion.
An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
It was, I tell you!
Well, go get cleaned up and we'll proceed with the weddin'...
Well, swear him out again!...I'll go with you.
Why?  You wanted for a crime, Ethan?
I thought we were trying to get the girls back -- <U>alive</U>...We jump those Comanches, they'll kill 'em...You know that!
Yes, sir...
Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
SURE!...They <U>WERE</U> here...Now they're out there...an' waitin' to jump us!...
You were born old...
Ay-eh...Made out I was crazy...  Ate dirt...chewed grass...I fooled 'em, Ethan!...an' I got away...
Keep talking.
Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.
In that case you won't find her -- and I won't get my thousand dollars.
I beg your pardon?
Easy!  It's forty miles, sonny...Horses can do with some grain and a little rest.
Sorry...We don't even know if Debbie 'n Lucy are with this bunch...Maybe they split up...
Get some sleep...Tomorrow's another day...
I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
Oh...
Forget it...
And have her whole family after our scalps for floutin' one o' their women?...No sir! Come on, Mrs. Pauley...
Why didn't he make his move back there?
I don't know...Somethin' tied his hands...maybe hospitality...
Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
We won't be here...Come on!
She's been with the bucks! She's nothin' now but a...
What's goin' on?
You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!
You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
'Dear Miss Laury'...He spells it with a Y instead of an I...E...Wouldn't you think he'd know...
Dear Miss Laury...I take pen in hand to let you know Ethan and me still are trying to catch up with them Com- anches the late Mister Futterman told us about...
It wasn't much of a letter...
I got to fetch her home...
I mean the armchair!
Oh, that was upstairs.  A real antiquity!  I think it's great.
Oh, damnit!
Yes, daddy.
We just have to make a new beginning.
Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times.  And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.
Someone from the village.
What? What am I supposed to sense?
I have a yearning for... smog, cars and many, many people... A real dirty... big city. What do you think?
I've killed my husband!
Writer, is he?
My Massacre at Paris is complete.
Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
Ask him.
A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
Romeo
Interesting.
Nothing comes.
Most interesting.
That's me.
A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!
Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business.  The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.
Yes, but very well.
Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my business I would be out of business if I had your courage, so don't tell me about business
Nobody knew!
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
Rosaline? You mean Ethel.
God's teeth, am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?!  What will you do in Act Two when he meets the love of his life?
How will it?
Yes, that's good. Until he meets
A comedy of quarreling families reconciled in the discovery of Romeo to be the very same Capulet cousin stolen from the cradle and fostered to manhood by his Montague mother that was robbed of her own child by the Pirate King!
My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
And I love poetry above all.
Above Lord Wessex?
"Madam!"
"Parting is such sweet sorrow…"
"Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
"Sin from my lips? Oh trespass sweetly urg'd. Give me my sin again."
I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter.
Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
There is.
Even your play.
Oh
And that was only my first try.
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
If not Wessex the Queen will know the cause and there will be no more Will Shakespeare.
Sold in marriage and half way to America.
Nor you for me.
Good bye, my love, a thousand times good bye.
My lord.
Do you intend to marry, my lord?
But why me?
The Queen has consented?
Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you!
Lady Viola is…young in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
No, sir.
He is speaking about a baggage we never even meet! What will be left in your purse when he meets his Juliet?
She loves me, Thomas!
Your aunt?
She sings too?
That dog!
By God, I'll fight the lot of you
With which of the following figures do you most closely identify: Joan of Arc, Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe?
I haven't lost yet.
Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
Why, thank you, David.
Dig the pit, I don't know.
You know what I'm talking about.
You know what. Who's going to do it.
Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.
If you give me the plate, I'll eat.
They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
Except the money.
Cover it?
I don't know them.
Yes.
Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people should know that.
Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
For the flat.
I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? Maybe it was just the emotion.
-- which is a hack.
A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.
What sort of car?
Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
You want me to kick it open?
Don't look?
No.
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
What?
I thought we all were.
Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?
I want my money back. Excuse me.
No, I don't.
Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.
Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this for nothing, so that I could have nothing --
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
Oh, shut up, Alex.
Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
Yeah, that's right, that's it.
Would you like to talk about it?
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
If I think you're lying --
Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
What happened to that guy?
What's it about?
Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
And that's not the same thing?
Do you think you have a good memory for faces?
It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.
Maybe... why do you ask?
Yes, but... I thought...
You make me sick. Just be straight for once in your life.
What are you talking about?
I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
Why not?
That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
I don't know.
I know.
She did?
Calm down, baby.
I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.
That's great. You look great, baby, great. Dennis, look at Felicia's hair.
Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?
It isn't?
Are you gay?... baked apple?... they're cold but they're good.
Gee, this is great.
Yeah.
You are.
And you need money?
Right, that's right.
You do know what money's like these days.
They are?
It's got nothing to do with inflation. Rates, for example, rise independently of tight money if you look at interest curves carefully. Historically, that's always been true, though most people don't realize it.
Pardon me?
I mean credit references, Mr. Roundy.
Jill's really great, isn't she?
Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
Well, I do.
Can't you do it out here?
I'd cut it...
Okay.
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
Did you?
You know what I'm talking about.
You did, didn't you?
You just can't stand to miss one of them, can you?
I don't want to... I swear...
Am I entertaining you?
-- oh I thought you were --
-- yes, you --
Why?
Lester's on his way.
Don't go, Jackie...
If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!
-- you know better...
-- c'mon, I'll get you home...
-- yeah, this is --
Okay... thanks...
I have to see you.
Okay!
Well, it's a big canyon.  Honey, I'm sorry but I've gotta get back... just for a minute.
Now, George --
How?
You're great.
You've never even been around one.
No, but I think they might.
I'll call you.
Neither do I, baby.
-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
-- please, baby --
How?
Does it make you happy?
-- A wash and set.
Well, baby, I'm George and it needs to be cut.  But I don't want to place you in that position either.
I see.
Yes it is.
But what?
After a while that hurts... doesn't it?
I know it, I know it.
Godammit, George...
Oh Jesus Christ.
What can I say!
I wanna know your thinking, I wanna know how someone like you thinks. Did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me? Does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them? Maybe that's your idea of being anti Establishment!
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
No thanks.
Okay, thanks.
What about Jackie?
Yeah, the clap. That's what she thinks. But who knows -- I don't know.
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
George is going to open a shop.
No kidding? Your own shop?
Aren't you going to have one?
I'm not. Maybe I am.
I know, I'm sorry.
Well, what is it, honey?
Well yes -- you know that about George.
-- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.
C'mon.
Well, there was this one time --
-- Yesss?
No, he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck -- God, it was hot. The wood on the sundeck, everything.
Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.
Well he's not exactly a friend.
-- no.
Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
I don't think so.
Well did he go in there with Jackie?
Are you married?
No.
Okay.
Yes.
Good.  I want you to like it here. I wish we could stay here for ever, and ever... ever.
Good.
French Fries and Ketchup.
Chocolate it shall be.  Come on son.
I'm not supposed to.
Do they know he tell you things?
Is there something bad here?
Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
Room 237?
Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
Yeah, I guess so.  Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.
Yeah, I know.  It always takes a little time to make new friends.
All right.
I won't, Mom.
Danny!
No.
Talking to Tony.
Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
Well it's just one of those things. You know... purely an accident, um. My husband had oh... been drinking, and he came home about three hours late, so he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night.  And well Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room... and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him away from them. It's...it's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know, in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just... used too much strength and he injured Danny's arm.
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
Who?
Well, he is a very willful boy.
Grady... oh.
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
Oh Wendy.  That's nice.  That's the prettiest.
Well I guess I probably heard you call him that.
Pleasure to meet you.
God, I've never seen anything like this before.  Are all of these Indian designs authentic?
I guess we've been staying up too late.
It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.
Jack...
Why?
Stay away...!
Go away.
I'm gonna go now.
Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind.  Thanks.
Well, that sounds fine to me.
Royalty?
Oh well he sure did a beautiful job. Pink and gold are my favorite colors.
Oh, I'll say.
Thank you, Susie.
Brady's a booger and so are you!
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up.
Jane, I have to talk to you.
What?
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
Do I need one?
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
Well... was it a prescription?
Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
Well... thank you.
Well... yes.  Yes it is.
What you say?
You know, I just might!
You know what we're saying!
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
What you do?
You know it.
You did what?
You pig!
You lying sleazeball!  The best years of my life!  What am I, garbage?  Am I lint?
What is it, Betty?
HE'S SO FINE.
WISH HE WAS MINE.  THAT HANDSOME BOY OVER THERE, THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR.
Why?
But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?
Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom.
Just about.  Show me again.
Chops?
No way.  We're a choir, right? Headliners.  The big room.  Two days a week won't cut it.  Every day.
Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
You know that song?
Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.
What?
A bunch of real mama's girls.
Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
That's true, wouldn't that be great.  Of course, we never know when things are going to change.  Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.
Three years.  A rookie.
Mary Clarence!
We're nuns!
What?
Are you talking about me?
Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
Mary Clarence?  Like a guy?  Like a dumb guy?
No problem.
Silence?  No talking?  All day?
A what?
A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
Useless distractions.
It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams.
What's wrong with my life?
Those girls were asking questions. They've got it rough.  I wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age.  I wish somebody would talk to me about it now.
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
Good day.
When are you gonna get off my case? Have you got a search warrant?  What do you want -- cheap thrills?
I never said he was an altar boy, okay? But he sent his goons after me!  They tried to kill me!  I'm not kidding!
You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
Listen to yourself.  This isn't a career opportunity.
I am?
No.  Most of the time I'm thinking about you.  And now... you've really changed.
That depends.  Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news.  I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true.
They open a window.
It didn't work, Vince.
Which one!
Yeah, right -- when I see it.
Yes?
All right.  It's a beginning.  Las Vegas, Nevada.
Which convent was that, Sister?
Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.
Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her.  Pull yourselves together.
Can you hold?  Can you try?
I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
You must have missed your mark.
Excuse me?
This should have bled by the pint. Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh. How... ?  Whatever weapon was used... it cauterized somehow....
In time, doctor.  Soon as I finish.
You need rest.
You will stay at her side?
Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
The heads were not found severed. The heads were not found at all.
No.  You will not run me out.  No one will believe a word of what you say.
Wallowing in sin and lust...
Yes, sir... but, do you have these?
Master Hardenbrook...
Must we again hear these heretical rantings?
Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.
Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
Listen.
What was she doing?
Lady Van Tassel...
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?
It might have been more.  Might have been positively grand talk.
Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.
The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.
What?
She is not your birth mother, is she?
But, I am not alone, am I?  I only wished to see what you were up to, and...  To thank you.
What would you have me believe?
His horse.
No.  Get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump.
Where?
She has taken the last of our grain to be milled.  You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
Very little.  I must be going...
I can show exactly.
In a way, yes.
You want to see into the nether world... I can show you.  Whatever you see, do not move or speak.  I will hold him.
I'll let you off while it's still daylight.
Scooter, let's me and you go over to Dairy Queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime.
Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
Well, I ain't scared of him workin' here. You know me. I'm a church goin' man. Forgivin' man. When your time's up the Lord's gonna come git you. You seared of him, Scooter?
Karl, come over here. I want you to meet your new boss.  This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back.
How are you, Bill?
Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.
Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for them rackets and breathin' things he does. Ain't threatened me with a killin' or anything.  But boy you couldn't of been more right about him fixin' things. That son of a bitch is a regular Eli Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves french fries. Eats four larges and don't even so much as belch. I'm proud to have him.
What you got in there, warshing?
They was a boy. We made friends.
Yeah.
You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet.  Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something.
What?
You know what we ought to do tonight?
This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.
Would y'all like that?
Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama said --
Come on, don't be a pussy. Everybody has to work.
I'll kill you, you fuckin' faggot! You mind your own business. Now get out! Now, before I get too mad to turn back.
This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.
Why'd you live there?
I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it.
Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
How did your mama die?
Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.
Will you stay here with us for a long time?
I like the way you talk.
Where'd you get them flowers?
It's name's A Christmas Carol.
That's than un on Christmas I was tellin' you about.
I didn't mean to say anything bad about you. I know you're good. You didn't mean no harm.  Did you ever think about killin' yourself on purpose like my daddy did?
I've studied about it. The Bible says not to or you end up goin' to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.
Yes sir, I reckon it does.
I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.
We'll be on teams, me and you?
Yessir.
It was fun, anyhow.
You have to Karl. You have to look out for me. You don't let that son of a bitch run you off.
You don't want to give away all your books.
I don't know. He just said he'd eat out there.
No, honey, we don't.  I'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh?
He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do better.
Well, when you like pricing items as much as I do, I guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later.
Me, too.
You better go get 'em.
I reckon.
I never was no good with history.
Yes sir.
Right now?
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
It's all right.  You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?
I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.
I like Frank. He's a good boy. Me and him's made friends.
Well, okay. I got you some.
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
We sure like havin' you.
It's been here seventeen years. Did you live here before or something?
What's that you say?
I mean tomorrow or the next day.
Oh. How about before that?
Before that I was thinkin' it'd be good if I could get another three or four cans of that potted meat if you got any extry.
I know.
Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. But it has pictures. I mean it's a regular paper, you know.
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
Almost done. A week or ten days, and I'll be there.
What's the difference?
Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.
I don't know, it just came to me. It's my corner, after all. It's just one little part of the world, but things happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It's a record of my little spot.
But they're all the same.
Hey, kid. You interested in a job? I just got word from your employment agency that you're looking for a position in retail sales.
He's crazy.
Anything good?
It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
Yes, I suppose I do.
Eighteen and a half years.
Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen.  She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant.  I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.
That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to the can or enlist. So, instead of going to college, I wind up in the navy for four years, I watch men lose their arms and legs, I nearly get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole, Bill.
It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
You don't give up, do you?
You what?
Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
And what's that supposed to mean?
You told me you wanted to meet him. Well,here he is.
Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm broke. I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car.
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
I don't know.  Maybe because I love you so much, boss.
Ruby McNutt. My one true love.
I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.
Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.
I just do what you tell me, Auggie. You tell me to sweep, so I sweep.
Fifty-six.  That girl had on a corset.
Forty-four. They're on special this week from the Canary Islands. A real bargain.
I think I'll take them. 
A good choice. You wouldn't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers, would you? Remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out.
The refrigerator?
What can I do for you?
Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.
I just want to know where he is.
He doesn't go to the Trinity School?
Henry told Cyrus he'd kill him if he ever showed his face around our house again. When Henry makes a threat like that, people tend to take him seriously.
Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.
It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.
Five bucks! You mean you're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it?
Son-of-a-bitch. You're some piece of work, aren't you?
Paul. Paul Benjamin.
I don't got no daddy, you dig? I got born last week when some dog fucked you up the ass.
They didn't have to do a thing, that's all I'm saying. The team was good, the best fucking team in baseball. But then they had to screw it up.  They traded their birthright for a mess of porridge.  A mess of porridge.
No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.
I don't drink coffee.  On the other hand, since you insist, if you offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn't say no.
Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?
Nice drawing. Did you do that?
I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood.  To make sure I don't run into him again.
Fair enough. We wouldn't want to get carried away, would we?  Now call your aunt Em and let her know you're alive.
Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
The end.
No, not the end. The beginning.  His son was just a little boy at the time, but the years passed, and when he grew up, he became a skier, too. One day last winter, he went out by himself for a run down the mountain. He gets halfway to the bottom and then stops to eat his lunch next to a big rock. Just as he's unwrapping his cheese sandwich, he looks down and sees a body frozen in the ice -- right there at his feet. He bends down to take a closer look, and suddenly he feels that he's looking into a mirror, that he's looking at himself. There he is -- dead -- and the body is perfectly intact, sealed away in a block of ice -- like someone preserved in suspended animation. He gets down on all fours, looks right into the dead man's face, and realizes that he's looking at his father.
Absolutely. We would be honored.
I'm serious, all right. You've got to square it with Auggie. Since you won't give the money back to the Creeper, you can use it to make things right with Auggie. That's probably better anyway. Better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies.
Research. I worked the scene right into my story.  That makes the medical bills one hundred percent tax deductible.
It's all right. I really do know them.
Yes, please.
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
In the war.  Europe, I believe. They could hardly send him to the Pacific, could they?
That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.
You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
Up in the air?  Was <u>that</u> your reaction?
Look at my face.  It's the face of the people who did that.  My father hardly speaks English.  We're in bad trouble, you have to see that.
You've been busy with that trial, I suppose.  Such a travesty...
Seattle boys think he's guilty.  They say the evidence is rock solid.
What else?  I had the boy teach me kendo.  Including...the importance of the bow.
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
Twelve.
My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist.
That's curious.  I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.
No, sir, I can't.  Not beyond a reasonable doubt.
It's public record.  If the public cares enough to read it.
He hit his head.  On the way in.
You're wonderin'...how come I never ask.  If you did it.
Maybe.
Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
What else could it be?
As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.
Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?
Funny?  In what way?
My suitcase - with all my resort clothes.
Manhattans?  This time of night?
Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
Shut up, will you?  I wonder how much Sam the Bookie will give up for our overcoats?
We're not too late, are we?
It's twelve bucks.  We can get one of the overcoats out of hock.
They got the bull-fiddle.
The police?  We'd never live to testify. Not against Spats Colombo.  Wabash 1098.
We are going out of town.  But we're going to shave.
Shave?  At a time like this?  Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?
Now you've done it!
Down, Daphne!
Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.
We would be caught dead with men.  Those rough, hairy beasts with eight hands -  They all want just one thing from a girl.
But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar.
And what are you trying to do to poor Sugar?  Putting on that millionaire act - and that phony accent -  Nobody talks like that!  I've seen you pull some low tricks on dames - but this is the trickiest and the lowest and the meanest -
Just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and Rudy Vallee.
Fat chance!  You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
No.  I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.
I'm just borrowing them.  You'll get them back tomorrow.
I'm engaged.
Oh, I don't expect it to last.  I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.
What engagement present?
Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
There you go with that we again.
I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
If there's anything I can do for you -
Oh, I can think of a million things -
I have a very low resistance.
Half-full.
I may spill something.
She'll rub it on me - and I'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
Vanity Fair?
Sugar, dear - let me give you some advice. If I were a girl - and I am - I'd watch my step.
That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
Well, I'll come back later.
I know what you need - a slug of bourbon.
He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.
Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?
What's the big idea?
The Florida job?
Sorry.  I'll be on the bandstand.
Goodbye?
And I smoke. I smoke all the time.
We won't breathe a word.
What a heel!  I spend four dollars to get my hair marcelled, I buy me a new negligee, I bake him a great big pizza pie...  - and where were you?
It's not the backs that worry me.
William Morris!
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
Sugar, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble.
I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.
Then why did you take this job?
You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -
That's a quarter of a century. Makes a girl think.
I want mine to wear glasses.
Want to switch berths with me?
Seventy-five.  That's three-quarters of a century.  Makes a girl think.
I wish you'd make sure.
Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.
Up, up, up.
They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -
What theory?
Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better.  What are you doing tonight?
Oh?
It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby.
Yes, you're in the way.  He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.
And you will come to hear us tonight?
You don't say!
Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
For me?  It's Shell Oil.
Well, that depends - on whether you're coming or going - I mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne?
Love it.  Which way?
They shrink when they're marinated.
Where's your shell collection?
You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
You're flattering me.
Well, of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.
You mean - like frigid?
Thanks just the same.
What is it?
Would you like a little more champagne?  And maybe if we had some music -  - how do you dim these lights?
I must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up.
I'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show.
Not tomorrow, either.  You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away.
Goodbye, my darling.
Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
Coffee?
A little country club we run for retired bootleggers.  I'm gonna put your name up for membership.
We got different information.
From who?  Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
Toothpick Charlie?  Never heard of him.
You boys know anything about any garage - or any witnesses?
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
Thanks, Charlie.
Why wouldn't I?
Honest, Spats.  I had nothing to do with it.
Exactly! Today’s my day. Tomorrow will be my day. And the day after that? My day.
Did Amy tell you she keeps her Homecoming tiara by the bed?
Yeah. Most important day of my life. Whatever. Listen, I chose you to be my Maid of Honor for a lot of reasons: I love you, you’re my favorite, and only, half-sister, blah blah blah. But the main reason I picked you is because you’ve been so miserable for the past few years, I knew you wouldn’t outshine me.  But here it is, my big day. My big day. And something doesn’t feel right. Maybe it was that pep talk you gave me last night, I don’t know, but your misery just isn’t working for me anymore.
I’m sure General Eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces.  Oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the Fletcher-Wootens.
So Dad rang the bell and when Tony Pee-Pants opened the door, I threw the tart at him and popped his stitches.
Oh, shut up. You’re an optician.
I have regrets.
It’s called character. God, you’re predictable.
Not for a dog.
Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
Oh, yeah.  So we split it. You know, as in “share.” People do that.
It’s cute.
That’s right. Imagine facing it alone.
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
Make out with you for free.
Spontaneously combust?
I didn’t say he was worth it.
So what’s with the nickname?
You’re judging me?! Oh, that’s a good one. You’re lying to me, you’re lying to your family, and you’re lying to yourself. But you’re going to stand there and point a finger at me? The man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?
I’m so sorry.
“...but it’s getting there. “
Will do.
That's where we come from first?
Colored.
And you're a tired little boy. I'll make up the cot and you must get some sleep.
He'll get his place too -- now off with your clothes and into bed.
It was the best thing I ever been to, Miss Johnson!
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
I can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father.  Come on, tell me...
:The night in the woods with his father and SOUNDER. The shouting and laughter after the baseball game --
:...FINER SPIRITS BOON AND GUERDON FOR WHAT THEY LOSE ON EARTH BY BEING BLACK.
:His mother, with her head thrown back, her eyes aglitter and laughing.
It's cold, Daddy!
We goin' huntin' again tomorrow ?
They is!? It shore is good to see you, boy!
I think so...
That musta been afta they sent me to this place call Clayburn. That was the hardest workin' camp they sent me to. The work was so hard, you had to look for somethin' to laugh about to keep from feelin' the whole pain in your body. Like one time, it was in the middle of the day, and there weren't no sun -- you hear that?
No, son -- they'd have to kill me before I'd let 'em do that to me again!
Now wait justa minute! You don't tell me what you ain't gonna do! I tell you! I say, you goin' to that school, you goin'! You hear me!
Sunday...
He will... Come on, git down and act like a possum.
Where did it come from, Mama?
Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
I got to, Mama. I know Daddy wants to see him.
But who's gonna help me here with the house and in the field?
No, thank you -- I gotta go do some work in the field today.
I'll walk...
And don't wake up Josie Mae and Earl!
You ready to eat?
To the commissary to get this boy some clothes! I'm gon' get everybody somethin'!
I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.
I got to see my husband, Sheriff Young!
Behold my glory.
Now go, your friends are in danger... The USO show is a mile east of here, just over that ridge. The clitoris has spoken.
How would you like to gargle rat jiz?
Maybe THAT'S who your father is, Cartman!
I saw him last night!
We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!
Yeah, but you know what? That whole part about lighting farts is bullshit. You can't do that.
What?
More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
Yes, hon?
Young man, you will tell Peincipal Victoria THIS INSTANT where you heard all these horrible phrases!
I don't know.
Something big, children.
Papa mama simi.
Guess.
Uhh... Bacon.
We can't leave without you!
Where do they come up with this stuff?!
I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
Good thing she was never your girlfriend... Dude, here comes Cartman.
What has the world come to? This is horrible. We're locked up, burning books, hating other people-
Yeah, but you know, I learned something today.  I learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... To love each other.
Yes ma'am!
Right away, ma'am!
What is Terrance and Phillip?
I sure did, Phillip!!
Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of words!
Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
I'm not cranky.  And that futon was not too big to carry myself-
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
I DO respect your mind! It turns me on! It makes me wanna fuck the shit out of you! Don't you see?
Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
What's the matter, Wendy?
Wendy?
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
Yeah, well...I forgot my morphine back in the room.
Well get used to it, 'cause here we are, on the cruise of a lifetime.
Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
Magnificent, magnificent.
Well a little business too.  In my upcoming project Star Trackers I play a ship's captain, and I really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience.  I feel it will add more credibility to my performance.
Of course, of course...
I'm sure I will.
Oh he did, did he?
There is a high level...of passenger 					dissatisfaction.
Well shut it off at once!
Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.
Thank you.
Nah, I already ate.  Why don't you just go down there?
That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 -
Yes I can transmit the code 3 emergency!  I just don't think it's a prudent move at this juncture.
Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
Really?
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.
Words to live by.
Why?  Where are you going?
What?  What are you talking about?
Don't worry about me.  There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.
I can't!
Hopefully sooner than later.
What do you mean?  What happened!
Good.  In that case, I pronounce us man and wife.
Thank you.
He's in the bathroom.
Talk to him...Jesus...
Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
Right, I understand that...
Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave.
We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?
Theo.
I know your face, you're an up-and-comer. You bowl on the tour.
I've never had orange whips, I'm from Akron.
Thanks.
It's mine.
You have no right to call yourself a bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face.
You're dead without the pro-tour, and you know it. Get him away from me. Sid and Breeze punch Theo in the face.
No...
I didn't mean that stuff I said. I was trying to keep you out of this muddle. I'm glad I didn't have my tubes tied. Oh, and by the way, I made a call for you before I - uh - retired. Buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen.
He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.
Buzz Fazeli.
What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles.
You know who I am?
I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress.  Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.
Profits down there, philanthropy up here.  Besides, it beats the pants off bingo.
I like the sport the way it is.
She ran away to be with that...  that Motocross champion.
You still got the touch Junior.
Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
Yeah.
No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman.  His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.
They suspended me.
This is a sign! Someone's coming to take Buzz away from me. I don't know if you're the guy or what, but I'm not letting it happen. I'm leaving him first.
Coming right up.
Mine, and they never tip.
Isn't this technically a scooter?
Do I want you?
So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?
Come on Theo, what about plan C?
So why do you stay?
It?
It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer.
We would have sooner or later.
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw in the tongue.
Ow! Ooh! No, please! Doc said I'd be back on the planks in a week! Show him Breeze! Breeze pulls a copy of "New York Bowler" from his pocket. The headline reads "RUB OUT!:BOWLING LEGEND KACKED BY DWARFSCAM KINGPIN" with a photo of Buzz Fazeli.
Dr. Levine, please!  Return to your seat!
Wait a minute --
How about I just press the button?
There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
Nobody move!
Shut up, Beth.  I don't want to hear it.
What do we use for defense?
Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
-- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.
It doesn't make any sense.
What's wrong with oxygen?
You don't want to know.
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
What am I -- a dog, now?
You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner?
Send them, damn it!  I know, but I'm not gonna be held responsible --
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
You don't know that.
He understands me fine.
Nobody goes inside, until we know <u>what's</u> inside.
Considered what?  That it's American? How would you think it's American?
What sub?
That's quite a secret.
Wait -- down where?
Underwater?
We have a library?
A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.
What?
They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --
Nobody said... Norman...  What?  Why are you looking at me like that?
You did, didn't you?
You bastard.
Beth --
I have to reset the sub.
You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
I don't trust Harry to do it.
I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.
Damn it, Norman!  He's lying.  Don't you get it?  There is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he's causing it.  Why can't you believe me?
I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...
He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.
How do you spell it?
The grooves around the door -- they've shifted.  And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now.
Your watch.
You tell me.
Do you fear them?
That's bullshit.
When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  "I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you?
But I have to, Norman.
Get away from the door, Beth.
From you, Norman.  From your mind. You're doing it.
Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.
What?
Yes you did.  Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there.  You know that.
Then what, Norman?
Norman, where are you?
You didn't say that about the food?
But why would she -- ?
Don't have to.  Watch.  It'll do it for you.
I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her.
Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.
It would erase all our knowledge of it.  All of our power.
Do you?
If it is an alien spacecraft --
Save your breath.  It's not an alien spacecraft.
Meaning?
What was that, sir?
This way, sir.
What report?
You mean they haven't told you yet?
Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
Try this one.
When he uses a phrase like "I am Happy", I think we should think twice about what we ask him.
I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.
My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was...
It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
It means you'd better get some rest. We'll be leaving for Mos Eisley first thing in the morning.  The trip will be difficult and dangerous, but it's the only spaceport with ships large enough to get us to Organa Major.  Now go on!
He's bluffing...
Just be warned, that things aren't always as they seem... especially the starforce recruiting posters.
Yes, sir.
Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
We have a little business to take care of first, but it shouldn't take long. We'll be back shortly.
Sorcery!  I believe in myself... I determine my destiny, not some mystical energy field.
See Threepio, come in, See Threepio. I wonder where they are??  See Threepio...
Get Chewbacca.  Try to get around it. I'll draw it away.
With four casualties?!
If you're as good a pilot as you are a swordsman... We're the ones who have been rewarded.
But you promised!  I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!
I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.
Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.
Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
Well, ask him.  Tell him we need five thousand.
Yes, sir !
Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.
Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.
Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.
They revoke our flight status.
Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.
Zander is going for pilot, too.
I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write !
I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
No, I think something's up. The Sky Marshall's here.
See you on the bounce !
Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one...
You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
What ?
A year at Harvard and you'll  see this "Federal Service" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves "citizens" and take airs for the rest of their lives.
It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years.
Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
I won't quit !
He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.
Sir, yes, sir !
Hi, mom.
You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
The Rodger Young just burned up...
I'm not interested in nostalgia, Rico, I need a corporal. You're it until you're dead or I find someone better.
Is V'ger the Captain of the alien vessel?
V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator.
Who is V'ger?
You may proceede.
<U>Why</U>?!
The carbon-units are not responsible for that.
By the Creator.
Departure angle.
-- You, personally, are assuming command?
Admiral, this is an almost totally new enterprise. You don't know her a tenth as well as I do.
Mister Decker; every minute brings that object nearer Earth!  Engineering! Stand by for Warp Drive.
I'm aware of that, sir.
Granted.
It's running our records! Starfleet strength, Earth defenses...
My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May I assume my duties?
Mr. Chekov, stand by on the phasers...!
Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!
Negative, Captain. I could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic. I can explain nothing more; I understand nothing more.
Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
I am seeking answers, Captain.
'Is this all I am? Is there not more?'
The point is, Captain, <U>twenty-two</U>    
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
To you, sir?
Nope.
Local Drama Group.  Northern Books.  No, it hasn't come in yet.  As soon as it does.  Yup, you too Marge.
Well, it had sentimental value.
Other one has history, too.  I wrote my play on it.
Could you tell me when's the next train?
And you're the only one who'll ever hear that speech.  Just you.
Everyday things...yes.
For example, he's just come back from a <u>fire</u> and he...um...  That's a fine house.  You look at that, and you know, there's nice people that live there.
I love your script.
<u>Yes</u>...
I...
What are you doing down there?
My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...
Better idea...
Would you go in...
Time for a change.  Keep your margins straight.
Yes.
I can't get it to come out right.
What's the scene...
That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...
I'd love to.
...the better to eat me with, your dear?
I saw...
Morning, darling.
After Drama Group.
That's right...
Let me review here: You're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us?
That's what they call an events cluster. Some guy, nobby orders a Manhattan, fifteen, twenty years, allasudden, three times inna night.
What?
I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
...why am I here...?
Nobody knows it but us.  Alright?  It says <u>here</u>...  Are we together on this?  Because it's sink or swim here, pals...
I loved it...he...
Well, I can offer you something to drink?
Sure, what have you got?
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
I've always seen that.
Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?
I'm ready!
There's other things to be learned.
Then what is the...?
Get him on the...
I really think that <u>business</u>...matters should be discussed between you t...
I like you, too.
...we had a script conference...
How many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
I don't want to take my shirt off in that con...What are these things that they're asking of me...?  Wha...wha...wha... I try to be good; the only thing I care about is...
Who are these from?
I know, I know.
...yes...
Claire:  As an interpretive artist to a creative artist:  Stay with me.  I need you.  We start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to <u>us</u>.  Stay.  Stay.  Tonight...when...  When they've gone.  Let's talk.  Let's <u>really</u> talk.  We could, we'll have <u>dinner</u>, we'll...a bottle of some bad red wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...

What is the...?
Arrest him.
I...
How about that.
Yes.
I'm very sorry I...
Oh, that's <u>great</u>.  Let's bring more people into this overcrowded world.
I grew up on your mov...
He's got a date, he's got a date, is this guy fantastic...?  Already he learned how to write a movie, and he found a girl to get his toes curled, what a guy, what a...what a literary find...!
You want me to lie.
I don't getcha.
I treated you like a son or nephew.
So be it.
And my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars.
Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
How was your flight?
Did you bring Bob's weights?
Pay her off.
Here it is: Statutory r...Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah..."statutory"..."unsupported testimony by the..."  Hold on, Bobby...  You've got nothing, and you know it.  By God, you know it.  Harassment.  You need a...Even if this was true, you need a witness.  You need someone puts her in the car, and you've got nothing.  Now we all have...yes, give her that part in the film.  Yes, we'd love to have you...Now: we all have more important things to do, isn't that right...?
...not the Lazyboy...
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
...the city council...
Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
You think so?
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
Bet you did.
Then I can't do this shot...you wants me to push in--I can't push in through the window...We go back to New Hampshire?
I have to work on my video project! Don't follow me!  I can put myself to bed.
I killed her!
Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there. That's one time always is always.  You can call him after dinner but...
She is but an arriviste.
Of course not.  Does he look lost to you?  BENNNNN!!!
He's badgering a witness.  Eat.
Annabelle pick up the phone.
He'll be impressed.  The clincher is, you <u>walk</u> away, then <u>whip</u> around...
A <u>suitable</u> boy, will be at <u>this</u> flagpole, <u>on</u> Monday, with a <u>very</u> expensive bike, and he will be a stone FOX if I have to call an <u>escort</u> service!
Doo-wop-doo-doo, <u>doo</u>-wop-doo-doo...
Thank you Ben.  Annabelle!
No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.
What honey?
Yes.
Sugar.  I was slow dancing to that song before Rachel was even born.
Ben where do you have to get to?
Half.  Of him.
You think I didn't get that?
Jackie, they come to be part of my life.  Rachel <u>is</u> part of that life.
Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.
<u>Slugs</u>.  Have faster learning curves. <u>Trees</u>, even.
Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago?  The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting.
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
Never stand between that kid and a meatball.
Nothing.  Look, I want to talk to you about...well...Luke said to ask you...
...a ridiculously <u>expensive</u> and <u>inappropriate</u> item, which her father and I have already <u>told</u> her she is <u>far</u> too young to own.  But <u>you</u> apparently want to <u>buy</u> her forgiveness, with...
I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration.  I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...
Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell --
Jackie?
Yes?
You're taking the kids.  And moving to San Francisco.
Nobody likes a snoop.
How the hell would you know?
That.  And.  Annabelle is over her head.  With Brad 'The Dreamboat' Kovitsky.
I think my 'primo shit' got left in my 'bellbottoms.'
Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
He won't discuss it.  Just calls it history.
You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
That's not wh...
<u>That's</u> what it is.  And that's <u>all</u> it is.
I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
I trust you of course I do but --
Rache, get out of th...
Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
Great, wallow in guilt, you <u>sure</u> you're not Jewish?
I needed some time away.
What do you call it?  You told her you had doubts.
No, here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'
He was in a concentration camp?
But that could've happened to him. Or to me, if I'd been alive. Or you.
I'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show. Any suggestions?
And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
Yes.
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
My grandchild-baby.
Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?
But really, you never know.
I know!
You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening…
He's right.
Is everything OK?
Ready for tomorrow?
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
You know he hated my story also.
Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
Man, it's just, like, conversation.
Yeah?
Don't screw around with me. You know what I'm talking about.  You're taking those SATs. You're taking those SATs or your CD collection is history. You're taking those SATs and you're going to college. You're taking those SATs if I have to strap your ass to a chair, but buddy your taking them.
You're welcome.  Dad?…Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
Can I join you?
That's good.
Ni...
NIGGER, FUCK ME HARD!!!...
Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...
Well, I went to law school, if you can believe that.
But what did you get on your SATs?
Uh, yeah, we're getting there.
Thanks man.
I dunno. I'd like to be good at something. It doesn't have to be TV. I mean, it could be movies...Anything. I'd be willing to direct.
Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.
After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
What's that supposed to mean?
Because I'll be firing at them.
We wouldn't have made it out without you. FILMORE Or without you.
Where does it lead?
You got it all backwards, Helen--but that's OK, you work for the government...
I said I don't want any, goddammit!
The transmission is an hour old...
What the hell is it, anyhow?
What!
I want the girl.  I don't care about the rest--but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world...
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
You know, when we reach Kompong Som--
The thing weighs more than a ton-- you want to roll up your sleeves and try it?!
What does that mean?
Our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices, jacketed in Cobalt-Thorium-G would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape. In ten months the Earth would be as dead as the Moon.
And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.
Give that back to me.
One, two...  three, four...  five...  Why you, dirty, stinking...
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
Well, I'm General Ripper's Executive officer. He'll want to talk to me.
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.
Well, that's the funny part of it, too, sir.  It doesn't show a damned thing.
Well, sir, about forty-six minutes ago one of my base commanders, General Jack D. Ripper, sent out attack orders to the thirty-four B-90's of the 843rd Bomb Wing, under his command.
Well, sir, they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base.
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red.
Condition Red!
Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
I hope not.  Now, as soon as you do what I told you, have Plan-R radioed to the Wing.
As soon as you've done that, shut down the communications center.  Lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details.
Please don't take any notice of this weapon, Major.  I love all weapons, and as of late, I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.
Yes, sir.  General, can I ask a question?
But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this?  I mean why do you want to start the war?
No, sir.  I mean I didn't think you hadn't given it a lot of thought.
I see.
Well, I think I remember reading the report on that.  Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
You're very naive, Major.  Don't they say they want disarmament?
I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
No, Major, I don't.  They have no regard for human life.  They wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.
And you'd like to see that?
Do you think we'd cheat?
Look, sir.  I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have.  Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it.  And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.  We're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.
Why can't you cancel it?
And I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know what the three-letter code is.
Mister President, I know you think I've let you down, but we had to have a Plan-R.  If we completely centralized the command and control, all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the Capitol, and we'd be out of business. We'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered.
But we can't communicate with the base.
Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
Hello, are you still there?...Uh-huh...I'll be right back.  We're still working this thing out.
Zlat, make sure the secret service boys care- fully search his seven body orifices.
Give me revs for maximum speed at sea level.
He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
Could you take her up right now, King?  Other- wise we'll get kind of close to the fireball.
Check your code again.  No one at base would pull a stunt like that, Terry.
Check, all bomb circuits green.  Okay, Lothar.
Check, ten thousand air burst.
Binky?
Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.
Wait a minute, Major.  "OPE," that's the recall code.  Where would they get that?
Take it easy, Major Kong.
Sorry, King.
Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.
Are you sure?
But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
I asked you a question, Lothar!
I don't anymore.
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
It was like hell with windows. You know, there's shit on the walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean, every day I would, I'd wake up in my cell and I'd think, my parents put me here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, because I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of control. I thought my parents loved me.
Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.
You know, like, like, I would always think, uh, you know, what if I make the wrong move? But maybe there isn't any right move. You know? I mean, look at us. You know, we all dress the same, we all talk the same, we all fuck the same, we all watch the same TV. Nobody's really different, even if they think they're different. "Oh, boy, look at my tattoo, you know?" And see, that's what makes me freak. Because I can do anything I want, as long as I don't care about the result.
Why is everything about you, Jeff?
I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.
Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.
No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.
And your mom.
That's the rock star thing.
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
Watch out for that tree.
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
No. Life is too short.
Sure.
Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright?
Wait. Hey, man.
Hey, man.
Buff...
Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer.
Jeff! Let's go!
Come on.
Play it! Come on!
You're fascist, man. Neofascist.
Pony, what would you say our relationship is?
Buff is funny. God.
I'm so burnt-out.
I will.
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
Oh, So what about her?
Well, play it, man.
No, no, whoa!
I mean, do you have something I could show my manager? I mean, do you have a reel?
I didn't want to eat this much, man.
Hey, Gary, how's the divorce comin'?
Okay. We'll go for a ride.
Maybe upper-middle-class.
"It's not a job, it's an adventure." Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.
Let's see.
I'm not a nice guy.
Hay? Yeah? So teach me a lesson.
Oh, sure.
Thank you.
Always two-fifty, my friend.
Uh-huh.
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
Yeah, well, that pizza could feed a family of four in Turkey or India or wherever the fuck he comes from.
Why don't you write a song about Sandra Berhard's salad, asshole?
What? Oh, come on. You're not gonna suck my cock?
No, no. I'm not, I'm not talking about this. I did a bad thing, Jeff.
Well, w-what happened?
Why? Because I give a shit?
Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to me. You lied to me because you're gutless. You're a gutless, drunken looser.
You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again.
Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it?
No.
No.
That's right.
Nazeer what?
Nazeer Chaudry!
Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.
It's a piece.
I don't want to hear it anymore.
No, no, no. Y-you know what? Y-your packing your bags, you're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you have talent.
Oh, well, then you better listen to him.
I'm trying to communicate how I feel, Jeff. You know raise consciousness. Make people think for a change.
One!
Hey!
No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest.
Can I talk here? Let me talk.
It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
Mm-hm.
I don't know.
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
Is that a threat?
Where are you going?
To his hotel?
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
What?
Just go.
Good, man.
Well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, Is that your limo?
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.
What do you mean?
Oh, yeah.
What are you saying?
Hey it's your roof. It's your fucking problem.  Hi, uh, there's an emergency down at the Circle A on first Street, Yeah, Okay.  You're fucked now, pal!  Um, send an ambulance 'cause I, I think it's an overdose or something. Okay. Okay.  Jeff, they're coming. Just wait here. I'm gonna go over to Scuff's and see if he's got his truck.  Listen, if she dies, you're gonna be so sorry that you ever showed your brown face in this town!
Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.
Oh, uh... uh, the other night our manager Danny took us to this restaurant and there was Sandra Bernhard.
I do. Jeff, don't you think Sooze should go to New York and, uh, you know.
Yeah.
No, I'm going.
Yep.
Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first place, you know? I think about people and I wonder what they're doing.
Yeah.
I think about you. I mean, a lot.
You do?
Where do you get your ideas?
I called Bucky's. I got her a cab. Is there any hot mustard?
What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
It's none of my business?
Oh, okay, it's none of my business. Yeah, so, you-you're trying to fuck my best friend's girlfriend and it's none of my business?!
... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?
I'm here.
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Jeff!
Shut up, Cleo.  Di, how much do you need for an abortion?
No...I've been pregnant.
Positive.
Look, I might be moody.  I might be gassy.  But I am perfectly sane.  Think about it.  In school, they tell us, "Dreams can come true."  Right?
Jack...
That was gas, Sweetie.
Jus some girlie things for the squad.
Yeah, hold on.
Don't use big bills!
Hello?
Kim-Lo?
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
Bullets.
Don't Martha-fucking-Stewart me!  If you don't like it - you try being a pregnant teen!
Or, I could get my own horse...
Hannah, we've...
Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
That's Itchy, alright.  How many y'need?
Maybe we can make a deal.
I'm only allowed "G" movies.
Okay, you can't tell anybody.
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
Stop it!  This is crazy!
Close, but no cigar.
Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.
Dark Windows.  How did you like it?
I had a teacher like that once.
I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little?
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you.
Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it.
He thinks it could be made into something.
I was afraid of that.
Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.
Nobody can be that busy.
Came  on back.  Let me show you where it fits in.
And here's a title: AN APPLE FOR THE TEACHER.
I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.
I'm sorry.  I don't usually read private cigarette cases.
Want something to drink?  There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.
No, no! I haven't heard any of this.  I never got those telephone calls.  I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here.
Hello, Mr. deMille.
Lots of people were.  Lindbergh had just landed in Paris.  Come on in.
What assistant?
We've missed you too, dear.
It's a good script, isn't it?
They're dead.  They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world.  But that wasn't good enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too.  So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...
Uh-huh.
And you'll play Salome?
I want you to do this work.
You'll like it here.
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
Suppose you make up your mind. Do you want this job or don't you?
I need some money right now.
Now you're being silly.  We don't need two cars.  We have a car.  And not one of thuse cheap new things made of chromium and spit.  An Isotta-Fraschini.  Have you ever heard of Isotta-Fraschinis?  All hand-made.  Cost me twenty-eight thousand dollars.
It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.
Maybe deMille is shooting.
I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?
All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?
You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
No one leaves a star.  That makes one a star.
For me?  Okay.
Is that so!
We have to be very careful.  No sleeping pills, no razor blades. We shut off the gas in her bed- room.
You made her a star?
You trying to be funny?  -- because I'm all out of laughs.  I'm over a barrel and I need a job.
Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach?  Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you're through.
Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car I'm talking about.  If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.
What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.
Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.
Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.
You know better than to interrupt me.
The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
Drive on. We have already attracted enough attention.
No, a super girl.
I've been saving it. For the right moment.
There's no need. I learned the Craft from my 						grandmother.
I have to.
Yes. It reminds me of home.
No.
What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
Just one kiss. For old times' sake.
Hmmm?
Well, there's several ways to go .
Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage.
I'll drink to that.
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
Yeah.
Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
How Lucy and that guy got to the hospital. And all that damage at the school. The police are calling it a freak tornado. I'd like to interview you for the Daily- -
Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy.
It's no trouble. I'd like to ask you some more questions.
Did anybody notice you?
Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOR-EL But what can you, a mere girl-
Must've been a defective puck.
But what for?
Please, as a favour to me? So I won't  be the only girl?
No, MR. Danvers.
You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.
Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.
It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.
Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.
Better than when I was a child.
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
The kid will do fine on his own.  Give it your best shot, Ricky!
You thought that?
No, thanks.
Oh, I wouldn't want to -- I mean, I'd want to, but I wouldn't want to...be a nuisance to you.
Anyday...
Exactly what I was about to ask about me.
What's that?
You know what Mr. White said. A photographer always goes after a story.
Gus Gorman.
They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
Who gets it, the company?
The boss wants to see you.
Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.
Thanks, kiddo. now, listen, this part's important. I want you to program one special command into all these systems. Tell them these orders are irreversible, so it'll be impossible for anybody to switch them back. Can you do that, pal?
It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
Exactly. Stoned mother.
What about me?
Superman. The boy you left behind.
Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---
Because you're the Editor-in-Chief. Your integrity is unquestioned. LOIS I have a question.
Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.
Don't cry, Bubba.
How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...
The planet Superman came from. Krypton.
Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?
Don't bet on it!
Yeah. I'll check.
How could you win a crazy bet like --
I was right. you are Superman.
I didn't think I wanted to.
Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
Dickens! The whole world's about to blow up and you're reading Dickens?!
What else is ballast for?
A parka.
Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
It's beautiful.
North.
Why?

Revenge! We will kill the son of our jailer!
Constantly.
Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.
We will bring him to his knees!
Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .
What more?
Put down Lex Luthor?
What shall we do now?
Don't worry. I will draw his fire.  With a few of my own.
Don't worry. I won't make you do it alone. I know all the right places. I'm a member at all the right clubs . . . We'll start tonight at the grand opening of the Metro Club! It's a date!
Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
I'm not avoiding you. I've been very busy and . . . I like you . . . I really do.
Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.
Let's sit down. They walk to the table. LOIS calls out to the balcony.
Any more like you back home, Clark?
And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can defeat Superman?
Mr. White, come with me I want to see
Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .
. . . And  very naïve!
He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
He's . . .  beautiful. Perfect.
Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
Lucky I brought my drums.
I made you, and I can destroy you.
Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
You've broken all the laws of man, Luthor. And now you've broken the laws of nature! . . .  I assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles I hurled into the sun!
Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.
Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
Stop saying you know when I say 'y'know.' I know you know.  Yes, I know you're here, Otis. What do you want, a brass band?
Thank you.
And stop interrupting. his is the big scene.  Your finest hour! You rose to the challenge, baby! And you lost. That's the best part!
Got it? Otis?
You and Lois, you get all the action.  There she is, out in the wild West and everything.
Lois isn't here?
But otherwise it's swell.
Supposing that man had hurt you? Is it worth risking your life over ten dollars, two credit cards, and a lipstick? I mean, it's not as if --
Oh, not really. I guess I'll just watch a little TV and --  --  unless...would you be interested in dinner?
Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition.
Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
Okay.  Take me to your leader.
Your father was a sick weirdo.
Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
I didn't say a word.
No, you're going to get kissed,
You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
I know...
Your volcano chum? Your junior life-saving buddy?  Let's get high.
He always shows up when somebody's in danger.
Of course I can. I love you.
You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton
Lara, please...
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong.  He will be fast, He will be virtually invulnerable.
And it is forbidden for you to interfere with human history. All you can do, Kal-El, even now that you have...found yourself...is help them to evolve. Set an example. Show them they must strive towards the light. And... remember us...
It does, huh?  Clark Kent, I'd like you to meet Lois Lane.
Do as I say. Let go!
It must feel great.
It's not bad.
Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!
Otis, were you up to your old tricks?
I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
Couldn't have said it better myself.  Now all this  --  --  west of the Fault is the most expensive real estate in the world. Los Angeles. San Diego. San Francisco. And here  --  --  is just hundreds and hundreds of miles of cheap desert land. Land that happens to be owned by Lex Luthor Enterprises. Well...  ...call me a fool, but ...it did occur to me that if a conventional five hundred megaton bomb were to explode at exactly the proper stress point --  --  that would trigger the upheaval that would cause the San Andreas Fault to 'do its thing.'  Ah, it would've been so nice, y'know...
--  Dropped into the sea!  Bye-bye California! Hello, new West Coast! Gold Coast! My Coast.  And now...well...  I left my heart in San Francisco...
Ally.  That was my nickname.
She's in trouble?
It turns to steaming piss.
I'll tell her that.
She's resting.  In her room.
That's because he misses you.
Why?
No.  I saw it on his face.
Berry-picking.
And what's that?
That's right.
Billy said that?
I did.
Excuse me?
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
I didn't say that.
Away from your crazy Mom.
No.  A little sugar though.
We had a terrible winter last year, didn't we, Sam?
Your Dad spent all his spare time in here.  He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.
I object to that form of question. Note that.
Did there come a time when the bus turned off Staples Mill Road onto
Hard to say.  I might have...some business here.
When?
A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
Of...course I do.  I just thought...I could get you another
Yes.  I can hear you breathing too.
I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.
I'm a lawyer.
Please.
You've been retained?
Their child died, and they got a lawyer.
Isn't that what you want us to believe?  That we're completely defenseless?  That you know what's best?
What time in the morning was this?
My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?
Until the accident?  No.  Yes, there was.
Positive.
Does it fit?
And I had to widen a few doors. You'll see.
You seem...I don't know...well, distant, I guess.  Hard to talk to.
Okay.
Will the police do anything to her?
Charlene's over at the Spread Eagle every other night.  Sleeps with whatever she can get her hands on. She'll go down for a pat on the head and a fistful of peanuts.
Is "he" inside?
You don't like it, do you.  I think she will accept, but I'm not sure. She may be too dependent on her brother.
I thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated.
Don't apologize for me, Frank!
Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?
Not in those exact words - you know what a temper he's got.
I don't like this threatening attitude.  When it comes to it, what the heck is it your business what they do, this boy and girl...
I'm late for a date with a dame.
No, I wouldn't...
Why, has he bothered you before?
Is it news to you?
Well, just be careful you don't knock her down, huh?
Right now you're in no position to ask questions!  And your snide remarks---
No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell!
Who said Sidney?
No...
Sometimes I think ALL men are fools!...
Bonna sera, commendatore.  Come sta?
No.  You're dead, son - get yourself buried!
Everyone knows Manny Davis...  ...except MRS. Manny Davis.
Yes, with your clients' names attached.  That's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world!  Now, as I make it out, you're doing ME a favor!
How?
You're picking up my lingo, hon.
But it's too late.  I got him back the job...
What does that mean - integrity?
...And he's got them on him.  I appreciate a thing like that - I appreciate where you are looking out for the virtue of the city.
Let's wait till Christmas - it's more legitimate then.
You're sure.  Find out for me.
No.  That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do.
That's what I'm thinking, Rita. Maybe...
And he's a perfect stranger to me.
Listen, you need him for a favor, don't you!  And so do I!  I need his column--tonight.  Didn't you ask me to do something about your job?  Don't you have a kid in Military School?
What would you think of me if -
- that's what I mean!
No, an arm, he said.  I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...
If you want me to -
Temple, I caught your act the other night and -
Good!  We're all off to Utica, so excuse me, Mr. Frannis-on-the- Portisan.
I wasn't looking for a brawl.  I came to bring him a present.  Wanna bite to eat?
No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time!  I was born only yesterday!...
I can't
What chip?
They have it in a vault at Cyberdyne...  It's gotta be from the other one like you.
Alright, yeah.  You're right.  We have to destroy the stuff at the lab, the files, disk drive... and everything I have here.  Everything! I don't care.
Yeah?  Who sent you?
Can I stop by my house?
No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
No.
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.
I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.
Alright, it!  We need it!
Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.
Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.
If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.
And Skynet fights back.
I want to know everything.  What he looks like. Where he lives.  Everything.
Eating is eating... and...
I guess so, sir.
You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.
The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.
What's that mean?
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
You bet.
Not yet.
But what... before that turns rotten...  What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?
You do shorthand and typing?
Says here because of your father. What's that mean?
And your father was executed.
I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?
What's in those files?
May I ask a question?
Sure.
You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
If you are going to bully me like this, Major, you had better do your homework. You obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are.
Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?
Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?
And what did he say?
Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand?
What?
Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
I don't know what you mean, Major.
They said I was dogged?
It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtwängler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.
He also conducted for Hitler, didn't he?
You're late.
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
Alright, the beige one.

You must have a girlfriend.
What's it to ya?
Yes.  Don't hurt me.
White light.  Pain.  Like being ripped inside out... slowly.  Like being born, maybe.
You'll learn.
I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...
Hot dogs?
I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
A girl.  You know.
You're not supposed to.
Then how are you supposed to get back?
Why?
Six shots at less than ten feet.  Weapon was a large caliber--
Because it's fair.  Give me next quarter.  If you still feel this way, vote your shares...
You're talking tomorrow.  Today is what counts.
Then, you kiss his ass.
I'll be right with you.
Please, don't do that...
It was an accident.
What's going on?  I'm going on my second job this month, and now I'm going on unemployment.
I don't know... he fell.
This can't be real...
He's pissing his pants.  Is that real enough for you?  Call 911!
What <u>is</u> your problem?
This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
Yes... well...
You're the one who started running.
I think not.
Let me go get some clothes on. We'll talk, okay?  Be right back.
How?  How could they have gotten anything?
What did you <u>really see</u>?  This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  Please, you've got to believe me...  He's got a gun, with real bullets!
Stop talking...
No...
Stop it!
No!
That's my fault.  I get too worked up at these.  I'm very method.  You do know... that's not my name.
Big family... small?
Julliard, yeah.
Always.
I don't need anything from you.  I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday.  So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.
You shouldn't have.
Why?
Okay, okay... okay?  I just... you know I hate surprises.
Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
Shhhhhhh.  Wait... wait...
C.R.S.  Who do you think?  Jesus H., thank your lucky charms.  To think what I almost got you into.
Yeah, almost...
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
We're going to figure this out.  Get a grip on yourself.
You're part of it...
Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...
Stop it!
It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends.  If I could have you back in my life... in some small way.  It would be important.
Yes.
You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
Oh, here we go...
You need to fill out those forms. Application, psych-tests: M.M.P.I. and T.A.T.  For the financial questionnaire, don't answer anything you don't feel like.  We'll run a T.R.W....
Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
Like, this way... sort of...
Thank you.  Goodnight.
He came to my mind recently, that's all.
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
Nobody worried about your father.
Because, if you don't know about society, you don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it.
Nice touch.  Does the game use real bullets... ?
Wanted to wish you luck.  Not that you'll need it.
I checked it personally.
That you've involved Conrad... is unforgivable.  I am now your enemy.
Sam...  Thank you.
Obsessive worrier.  Join the club.  And you?  I'd guess...
Watts.  Those were his keys Nell found.  His roommate called and said Watts left when he was supposed to.  I think he's here.
Yeah.
No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
Not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!
This is the last chapter.  Please, please give me clearance.  It's for science.
Well... we're glad to have you.
Yes, because someone was always keeping me awake.  Ever since I was little.  That was my job.  I took care of my mother and I had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time.  And after she died, well, it's been a few months, but I still, I still wake up, it's... a habit.  I know we've only known each other a couple of hours, but I'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this.  I'm really happy to be here with you.
And then what happened?
I wish I were.  I wish I had done it, then I could confess and you'd be at peace.  That great moral philosopher Frank Sinatra once said to someone he loved, I wish you had an enemy, so I could beat him up.
It's not real?  Crain?  He's not real?
Test it.
Every day.  Basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening.
Yes.  But I promised I wouldn't let her alone the whole night.
I'm with Dr. Marrow's group.  I'm supposed to check in with Mrs. Dudley up at the house.  Is she here?
-- no one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.  No one will come any nearer than that.  In the night.  In the dark.
What did it cost?
Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.  D'you know what I mean?
Yes.  I've missed it.
You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.
Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe they're not even his.
Maybe he never came in.  If he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right?  Or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell.  Maybe he's outside.
Maybe you did it yourself.
I don't know.  You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention.  Maybe he did it...
Well?
I think so.
Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
Then what good is he?
Not for you, clearly.
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
Well, you're certainly not a person.
Anything but Japanese.
Why?
I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.
Oh, god.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
Because --
I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
Well, either they have a very liberal work-release program, or he's out, because he's here in L.A., looking for you.
Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
We'll find him.
Y'what?
This ain't your lot?
Those streets up in the hills, man. Gotta be real careful, keep your eye on the ball.  Two o'clock in the morning, it's dark, your mind is all agitated, you're drivin' a little too fast ...  Those curves don't kid around.
Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress.  Before she met him.  But that's not where she met me.  Not in my restaurant.
They look a right load of wallies. Patrolling back and forth outside the gate, all ponced up like the fuckin' Household Cavalry.  Watch it.
You goin' back inside?
The lot.  The whole British bloody Post Office.  I had a brilliant plan -- all worked out -- work of genius, it was. Could I get anybody interested?  No -- they're too busy pinching orange squash from the milkman.  Lazy sods.  Jumble sale on in Watford, they'll be up at the crack of dawn.
You just cooking then?
Hard to miss.
It's been a while.
I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
Try calling me again.
If it played in England somebody owes me money.  Who told you that -- Eddie?
Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.
My employer.
Are you serious.
Terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  Not the type.
Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.
Still, you could never ... do what she wanted.
Poor baby.
I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has done, son.  He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg.
Yeah, I guess you are.
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
A <u>statement</u>?  I wouldn't mind getting a statement.  You see, <u>my</u> client -- the United States Government -- would love to get a statement about a few of the deals going down with your client.
You sure?
Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well. Good to meet you.
Where else?
Sounds like you need a rest.
The forever kind.
Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?
I don't know.
You do?
Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't wrong.
Looking for a bloke named Valentine. Know him?
I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson.
EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
Tell me.
Beethoven. He created it, and yet he never actually heard it. I suppose he heard it all in his head, somehow.
I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.
It's OK...
Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
And how do we share--
Ed.
You're out of line, mister.
Way out of line.
I got the paperwork here. Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I supply professional services, you supply the capital. I'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh?
That'll be fine.
OK. Take your coat, Ann?
How's business, Dave?
All right, I guess.
Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
I only work here! And the lady's husband would know... Oh, Jesus.
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
He's staying at the hotel I've gone to with, uh, with the lady in question. Must've seen us.
Please, Ed.
I, uh...
Oh, don't be a grump.
Who?
Don't tell 'em anything. We're getting you Freddy Riedenschneider.
You don't have to tell me anything.
Good! Any questions give me a ring-- Turandot suite; if I'm out leave a message. You sure you don't want anything? No?
Terrific. Your husband backs you up. That's terrific.
--don't interrupt me--that's Means. They got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got *you*, a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone.
He and Doris... were having an affair.
...I don't think so.
Who? *Who?!* I don't know who! But the point is that if Mr Prosecutor over there had devoted half the time he's spent persecuting *this* woman to even the most cursory investigation of this schmoe's past, then we might *know* who! But we can't *know* what really happened! Because of Fritz, or Werner, or whatever the hell his name is! And because Me Prosecutor is *also* a lazy fat-assed sonofabitch who decided it's easier to victimize your wife! Because it's easier *not* to look! Because the more you look, the less you know! But the beauty of it is, we don't *gotta* know! We just gotta show that, goddamnit, *they* don't know. Reasonable doubt. Science. The atom. *You* explain it to me. Go ahead. Try.
Oh, hell. Drink?
He a good man?
Taking it seriously.
Uh-huh. He's the, uh...
I don't work here. My wife does.
Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig van Beethoven.
He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
Huh?
Uh-huh.
Sure, go to the store. Go there, describe to the man where you will be fishing, and for what, and the weather conditions, sun, no sun, whatnot, and so forth, and then you might as well have the man go ahead and sell you the goddamn FISH, Ed...
This hair.
...You ever wonder about it?
Yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal?
...Nah.
My *wife*?
Barber, right? I'm Freddy Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell me the chow's OK here. I made some inquiries.
Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
It's too late now.  Guests are arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling up.
If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
Calm down.  I found it!
Oh Jesus...
I think I should come with you.
I'd say we're in its home.
Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
Your work is highly relevant.  What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.
I'm not giving up.
A blow dart.  Seed pods.  A plant press.  Pretty unimpressive stuff.
Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat.  Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard.  If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go?
They fill seven floors.  We have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world.  Just to give you an idea, there are more than three million insects specimens.  Not to mention amphibians, reptiles, birds, anthropological artifacts, meteorites, minerals and gems.  Only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display.
You said you had plans of the museum.  Could we see them, please?
Don't be a wuss.  Come on.
They were yellow!
Not yet.  Let's try the fork to the left.
But at what a price.
Yes.  Whatever killed Beauregard may have lived on this plant.  When the crates were put in secure storage, they were out of reach.  The killer couldn't get them, so it got the next best thing.
An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.
You have time to talk?
Gone.
No.  The planetarium is in the next cell.  This is one of the fire doors...
Then it won't go after the others?
It's coming.  Run.
Where exactly?
Today.
We <i>have</i> had our close calls in the past.
How <i>do</i> you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence?
No, of course not.  And since the show runs 24 hours a day with no commercial breaks the staggering profits are all generated from product placement.
All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.
Let's take another call.  London, England, you're on "Tru Talk."
You're the star.
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
You think she'd go through with it?
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
You have a boyfriend?  Of course you do.
Outta my job, outta Seahaven, off this island...<i>out!</i>
Sorry, I'm way behind.
Are you okay?  You look like shit.
I think it's got something to do with my dad.
No.
When you were hauling chickens for Kaiser Poultry, what was the furthest you ever went off the island?
Gee, that's great.
And then what, Truman?  We'd be back to where we were five years ago.  You're talking like a teenager.
I think I'm going to stay up for a while.
Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.
How do you know?
I'm sorry, I'm late.
You blaming me for the traffic?
I've changed my mind again.  What's New Orleans like this time of year?  Mardi Gras.  Or let's just see where the road takes us.
No.  You said, "Do something."  Who were you talking to?  Tell me!
Truman, stop it!
I've got something to tell you.  You'd better sit down.
About time they started cleaning up the trash Downtown.  We don't want to end up like the rest of the country.
Tell her, tell her...I had to go to Fiji. I'll call her when I get there.
Well, thank you for your help.
There's no one here.
Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.
We don't even know you.
You're not FBI agents.
Sorry. Don't have one.
I'm looking for him.
No. Just fossils, far as I know.
Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.
Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict.
What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?
When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.
A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.
You've been using me --
Where are you, Scully?
You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.
-- Mulder! Get in the car!
What? What are you talking about?
There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous.
You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
Evidence of a massive infection.
I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
I've got a hearing tomorrow --
And where are they going with it?
Where would they be going?
Been where?
Very weird.
I've got no allergy. Something... this... Mulder... I think... I think you should call an ambulance.
Where are we?
You got me. But I think I know what they did with Jimmy Hoffa.
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
-- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
-- if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.
I've got to find Scully.
A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
Where is he?
Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.
This isn't Colonization, it's spontaneous repopulation. All our work... if it's true, then they've been using us all along. We've been laboring under a lie!
Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
That's my girl.
Agent Novak.  I didn't get a chance to clear him.
Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
...give a kiss to Edward.
I realize that...
I did, yeah.
He might tell me about Julia.  The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse.  Who wants to be redeemed.
Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same guy?
What difference does it make...?
's broken.
That hoist, with the winch...
Delano?
They took care of that, thank you, Henry. 
That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's "lost."  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy.
Yes.
What about the cat?
Grandparents.  Live over in Davis.
No.  Can you get a man close?
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
I don't know. How can you know a thing like that afterwards. I don't know anything any more.
The police. They're searching my room. Sie mussen doch wissen.
Dr. Winkel.
Whiskey.
What's that?
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
I wish I knew.
I shall be all right.
He's safe in the Russian zone.
Why should he help me like that? The Russians will only make trouble for him.
I have never seen him.
If you help me, I am prepared to help you. ANNA Martins always said you were a fool...
Just around the corner.
No, not yet.
Martins.
September '39.
He was...
Getting around, Martins.
Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.
Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
Which side of the road?
I'd like to visit Texas one day, sir.
She's been arrested.
You don't care anything at all about Anna, do you?
It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
Sure...
Zwei zwartze.
What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
What's the name of this girl?
Yes.
English?
Joseph Harbin.
Joseph Harbin? No...no.
Why no, Mr. Martins.
Here.
So?
I'm sorry.
Hi there. Here, take a look.
What??
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
Just don't.
You gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.
Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that --
Yeah, I read your piece. It's very smart. And very wrong.
Abstraction. They're obsessed with abstraction.
Where'd you read all that stuff?
How come so many of the books are in Spanish?
I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
Yes, I am. Basically I am.
No.
Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?
What's it about?
Fuck that.
I mean kiddush. Let's say kiddush. And shave my head, fuck through a sheet, all that stuff...  Come on, just for fun. To see what it's like...
Nothing.  Why are you doing this?  I thought God didn't exist.
And be crushed.
You gotta get out of here.
I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were.
Notice? Like what...?
I don't know. Is that right?
Female...
It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
I don't think you know what you are.
Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
Point out all the lies and fucked-up thinking.
You do it on the inside....
Balint?
Fine.
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
Steve's going to explain it.
I just came to get some stuff. I'll be out in five minutes.  He doesn't want me around.
They're not my people....
Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up?
Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the <i>New York Times</i>.
<i>New York Times</i>...?
Her place is down the road. But she just comes out for weekends sometimes.
You could do it.
I've gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I'm serious. I'm always talking about it. This time it's gotta happen.
Who even knew?
What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
You want to kill a Jew. I already did.
What are you trying to say?
"Do chickens give milk?"
And that's when the Mets started to stink.
Just a little... What's the difference?
What?
As you know, Cindy, thirteen is a mystical number in the Jewish faith. We believe that God has thirteen attributes...
But your man isn't quite a God!
Of course.
The documents are forged.
He seems to have won it.
Johana Cross, pleased to meet you.  Well!  Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here.  It's incredible!
In a lake.
He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "I'm going to beat you".
You going to sleep here, all by yourself?
Damn it!  Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
Have the car painted.
They say I'm like Lazarus.  You know, the guy who was raised from the dead?!
You don't have a room?  Paolo?  What did I just hear?  I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
Yes, of course.  Lots of questions.
Damn right!  That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
Forget it.  I was joking.
What?
Why?  Are they what's most important?
As I said, second of all you're too skinny.  You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.
I give you this.  You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.
Thank you.
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
I can't.
I'm being a pain in the ass.  It's beautiful here.
Just because... I would have liked to visit the town... See the coast... I don't know anybody... Expect for you.
Lucky I was there to save you.
I'd better get back now.
Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
No, I'll be fine.  Can you just hand me a glass of water?
Why?
... Are you sure?
Ah?!
That's different!  What's the matter with you?
No.  I'm just depressed.
That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon.  It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator.  Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
Why is he doing this?
You've made me a happy insurance person.
... Yes?
Well, then I've got good news for you. We just got word that he'll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today. I'm sending Esther to meet you there at once.
About an hour ago, we received this transmission from the North Pole.
He works too much. God forbid he should have a nice Jewish girl come eat by him once in a while. Take his mind off his work. Maybe a blowjob here and there.
Please, call me Mordechai.
Afterwards they'll make the decision as to whether or not they'd like to continue their religious studies in Israel. Because, hey, after all we'll have practiced the highly effective assertive democratic style of child rearing, sprinkled with a healthy dose of liberalism.
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
I can see. And you also brought a nice girl to come eat by us.
Mom, stop with this already. Of course I love you. You're my mother.
Mazel Tov!
Yeah, I'm going to be out of the office from 1:30 to 3:00 on Sunday. I have a terrible yeast infection and I need to see my gynecologist.
Oh yeah. Take a look.
It was good. Very chilling, but you still got all the points across that we talked about.
I don't know. Why don't you ask them sir.
Resting?
It's Friday.
That depends. How much money has he?
Drink your beer and don't get so excited.
You get your money from your husband.
I sleep it off.
I don't know. I want him to lock me up.
Where? Where did you find it?
What are you doing that for?
Yes. It's always fascinated me.  You know, once, when I was a youngster, I went to see Mrs. Leslie Carter in "Zaza." After the play I stood in the alley just to watch her come out.
I want to ask you something.
No. I'm quite sure.
Sure -- certainly —- but what's that got to do with this?
Caged animals are unpredictable. They're like frustrated human beings. I can't answer your question.
We're old friends.
More or less.
I don't know.
But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
No.
Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?
Tell me.
Why do yo&amp;i accuse me? You don't know what you're doing -- you don't understand -- nobody understands --
I didn't want to kill, but I had to. I heard her in the cemetery - talking to the man in the auto --
Various reasons.  But I can't see why you'd be interested in the rather dusty career of William Galbraith — teacher, naturalist, curator -- when you lead such a gay and exciting life yourself.
Go on foot.
That's easy. Me.
You're too good to me.
Almost three years, isn't it? And have I ever done anything to hurt you?
We all, had to look at the body. It was awful, Kiki -- awful!
That's funny -- I never knew you to lose that much before --
It's all right. I'm not hurt.
Kiki, Galbraith said something to me once, -- something you ought to know. We were talking and he said that people were like that ball on the fountain at the hotel --they got pushed around by things bigger than themselves. That's the way it was with us -- and we were too small to see it that way.
Must it?
You a tourist?
Can it be that easy?
Disney! How inter...
What... What are you talking about?
Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
Uh... Wait a moment, Mrs De Moraes...
You’re repeating yourself, Mrs De Moraes.
Huh! Don’t you recall convincing me he had?  You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it.
How... When did you...
I didn’t know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just...  Do you think we spoke about it? I’ve known for five years. He’s known I’ve known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesn’t speak about...
Something like that?
Where is that?
Croissants.
Not in America, sir. You must be from Europe.  So, black coffee and a couple of crescents.
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassy’s out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think I’ll get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, it’ll be too late.
What about your friendly cop?
No. You’re looking at a real Musketeer here, Whitney. Brave and rash. Had to dash in there.  Take a prisoner... Might as well have sent them a notice to quit...  Come on, Musketeer! Got anything to say?
I saw the ad at George’s.  I’m passing through town and I’m in a hurry.
May I have your phone number?
What sort have you got?
Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?
Yeah.
Yes. Friedman’s the fuckin’ Austrian!
And who does Friedman work for?
What about the staff?  They’re in on what’s going on, aren’t they?  How many of them?
B-Black...
How are you, Jane?
Should I?
Oh no. I’m all right. He was a jerk, really. Another boy, you know? All I meet is boys. When I think of all the fuss about older men fancying young girls. I mean, is it true?
I’m sure... As far as you know, when and where was your son last seen?
Fine. One more thing, Mrs and Mr Spitz; may I ask what is or was your occupation?
You’re making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guy’s not one of Friedman’s...
I told you... The rabble, it’s me...  Huh... It’s sad.
What is?
What are you talking about?
An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.
Shut up! Where’s your wallet?
As you know from speaking to Phil, your friend Leon has disappeared, Rhian. His family have hired me to find him.
He just said he had good reasons.
That’s what he said. I tried to dissuade him... Told him I couldn’t take on another child, that he’d get into trouble... I mean, people who sell children... But he wasn’t listening... I guess he finally found himself a crusade... His family think he’s back on drugs, eh?  Huh... Leon did drugs. A lot of drugs. Went through his self-destruct phase, you know?  Things to come to terms with. Demons to fight... Some people’s minds are gloriously uncomplicated. Not Leon’s. He did beat the drug, though. He did.
... No.
How’s the boy doing?
Fine...
Three days and that’s three days too many.Come on. Get your ass up.
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesn’t appeal to you...
No shit... Well, I’m afraid I can’t help you.
Mon bureau coûtait trop cher.
Le montage, l’emballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors’ stuff. How much would it cost me?
A l’achat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais ça pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. C’est pas vraiment mon truc.  I don’t know any Austrian, Xavier.
But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable.
Who?  I don’t know who the fuck you’re talking about, sunshine.
If he had, you’d be dead.
So why didn’t he?
Huh. I’m a businessman. What are you, eh?
Cost what?
Costliest!
That's a good idea, sire.
What do you mean?
So... pretend it's not a game.
Jeanne's been badly injured!  She jumped from the top of a tower into a frozen moat!
Yes.  I didn't confess today.
Good.
But... to be honest... I don't think they'll leave tomorrow.
I don't know it.  I feel it.
Do as I say!
But that was her order!
Ah, yes, I forgot... God sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission!  Do you think that God made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of France?
I leave the answer to God.
So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
Yes, but...
Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  I've had enough!
So long as this bitch remains alive, our armies refuse to fight!  Don't you understand?  They want proof that God is on their side... and the only way they're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch!
Scared of a girl?
I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church.  Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
Well find some other way!  Be creative.  Tell them she fucks the devil... Hmm, not a bad idea... why can't you say that?  Sounds good to me... and who can prove she doesn't?
I will hear you... but not now, not here.
In a village called Domremy.
Not long ago...
Many things...
No... I want to be confessed.
And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...
It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.
You really think she's been sent... by God?
But... her army's so small now...
Supposing she's an assassin?
Yes.
Xaintrailles...!  Don't talk to me about miracles...  If I was still sitting there waiting for a miracle, I'd be dead now. Anyway...
Yes.  We can pray.
Good idea...
No good?  This is a disaster!
Jeanne, look behind you.
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
You also cut your hair short like a man, and in the Bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man!  It proves your desire to deceive...
It seems to me that the Church and Our Lord are one and the same.  Why must you complicate what is so simple?
Nothing... just taking his teeth.
Don't swear...
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
Who gave you that horse?
What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you.
Why would they?
Yes... yes!  And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's "the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..." he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery?  Why didn't he?
I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
I don't think so.
No...
I'm sure he'll forgive you.
And your mother -- everything's fine with her?
Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
I feel safe here.  And it's where I can talk to him.
Jeanne, be patient.
Yes.
I came specially to meet you today. I love your playing, but what a day to choose.
Wladek, please.
No one plays Chopin like you.
How are you doing?
Fine, no, not really, they arrested my cousin, but Jurek says they'll let him out.  This is disgraceful.
I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
You'll have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon.
They're hunting people on the streets. They've picked up Henryk.
What?
Believe me, they've picked him up.
Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.
No. Three hundred and sixty thousand, so it'll be easy.
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
It's a little cut, nothing.
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
Ohh no, it makes my skin creep!
No, it was a table.
Mother used to sing the songs in German and her voice would echo across the valleys
She lives her own life in New Jersey, America.
I'd like to make a swap.
I don't want to learn.
You don't want to learn.
No, but her words are in my head.  I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.
Jesus! I'll kill him! I'll kill him. What did she tell him?
Let us not discuss this further. I am very pleased....
Take this to Baines. Tell him if he ever tries to see her again I'll take off another and another and another!
Nobody.  I just know what kinda women he likes.  I'm gonna check all the joyhouses till I find him.
I gotta!  Look, I run some slots down in West Bend for a mob here. I got a little behind on my payoffs so they figure I been holdin' out on 'em.  They gave me to 4:00 to come up with the cash.  I don't get it there I'm dead.
How bout you?  I'll give you the whole hundred!
What do we do?
Hell no, I just cut into him.  I woulda settled for pawning one of them shoes.
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.
It's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the Big Con. You're wastin' your time workin' street marks.
Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.
Shove off, Duff.
The bastard.  He can blow his nose all the way.
I'm busy, Floyd.
Good lad.
Got to.  Gondorff's ridin' the mark in from New York on the Century.
Lonnegan after you, too?
I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.
You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.
What do ya mean?
Did he hold you up on anything?
Naw, I'd just blow it.
Everybody'll sit still for somethin'. What did ya find out about the train, Eddie?
Nothin' yet.  I got a good one on the lead at Hialeah, but he's fadin'.
Lonnegan.
The name is Lonnegan.
You're more gutless than I thought.
You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
I'll square it with the fixer.
Look, I don't have time to fuck around.  There's somebody out there I don't need to see.  You got a fire escape or anything?
He'd like to kill me.
And you expect me to come over, just like that.
If I expected somethin', I wouldn't be still standin' out here in the hall.
How ya doin', Jimmy.
I'm a banker, friend.  That's legit in this state.
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
If I'm not there by quarter of, I'm not coming.
You got a system, Carver?
I'm in.
Had a little fight with a raggle down on 13th.  She got me with her ring.
Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.
Like hell.  You won't even get a review till you're seventy.  And if the board starts to go soft, we'll let ya out in the yard some night with a hard-nose young bull who'll put fifty slugs in your face and ask what you were doin' there later.
I'll need a room over there that faces this way.  How much a week?
Come on, gimme a break.
He was?
Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper.
Give it to me.
Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?
Hello, there!
Yes.
We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks.  Why don't you drop around?
I've got to see you alone!
Why... in the heart.
Yes, she would.
But it isn't bad weather now.
Better get home before it is.
Must have been in the war.  That might account for the cane and his limp.
Not a thing.
Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.
No.
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
Trail him!  Trail who?
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
I'll take care of him.
Yes.  But he didn't show up.
Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
Goodbye.
I guess all the suspects are here.
Sit down!  We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole.  Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
I couldn't go near that woman.
Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
I trust you.
Dorothy told me you were here.  I was going to telephone but....
I see.  I see.
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
No word at all?
That's all right.
Slim.
It wouldn't hurt to put it in.
What do you think?
Well, don't you?
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
I didn't knock Julia off.
How is Studsy?  I didn't know he was out of stir.
Why do you say that?
As long as there isn't a fire hydrant.  What I've gone through --
Who is she?
I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.
No.
No thanks.
Yeah.
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
Yes.
The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.
But Wynant --- ?
I don't believe he did it.
So am I.
Catch me letting you go alone!
I'm going to take Asta for a walk.
I don't care - I'm just used to you, that's all --  If you let anything happen to him, you'll never wag that tail again!
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
It was his body that was buried there.
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
I don't know.
I hope you're well.
Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
You shouldn't let that keep you from telling truth, Mimi.  Mrs. Jorgensen -  Were you ever divorced from Chris Jorgensen?
What's in the other direction?
Better grab up some sand to take home to your family.
I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
They shouldn't have been out this way, that's all I'm saying.
Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.
And find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the Humvee, and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that's about it.
What do you figure it to be?
How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it.
Then step aside.
Get out of my way.
In the service you do, but we're not particularly in the service right now. Way I see it, what we're doing, that doesn't particularly give you the right to toss orders around.
Suppose I don't go for that?
So you can give us away?
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
Christ!  Wes, tell him.  You know this stuff.
You know, you sound just like a boy who's never--
I know.  I know.  But I'm saying, if they knew.  We're going to be millionaires, man.  Millionaires!
Yeah.  I know.  I'm with you.
I'm just going to have a little sip, that's all.  Just a sip.
What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?
So good bye, Shi'ites.  Thanks for playing.  We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.
I feel air.  Probably opens up outside somewhere.  That's where the light comes from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon.
What's to stop him if he wanted to?  All he has to do is cut the line...
It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
We need something:  A flare, a signal mirror.
What do you mean no?  They can fly us home.
Is it all right if I stand up?
Yeah.  Well, me too.
You still got a map on you?
Okay.  Then we go this way.
Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.
I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
What are we going to do?
I just said I would.  I don't think I--
Shi'ites, I think.
Why do I have to lie in the road?
Then I'm a rich man.
Thanks.
Don't make so much out of it.  Only reason I haven't figured a way to get all that money for myself is because I've been too busy figuring ways to stay alive.  Believe me; if I had a minute to catch my breath I might have played things the way you and Wes had.  I'm no better than anybody else.  I've just been busier.
We'll make up some kind of lie.  They won't find the gold.
I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of Iraqi.
The photos.
It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.
Don't even try it.  You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.
You will.  You'll get it.
At-at-at-at-at.
You know what, Wes?  If you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war.
Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you figure it is?
Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
You know what I'm doing with my half?
Oh, God!
...I figured...I figured you'd turn back.
Really?  What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?
Probably would've too if Epps wasn't around to stop you.
We make it, or we go back empty handed.
He lived through that?
We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
You actually got around to killing someone.  I'm impressed.  I guess you're only half a bitch.
Correct.  Now secure a sinex drop reading.
What happened?
See if you can get a reading on tactal retention.  Try to estimate it without a meter reading.
Now?
I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.
Looks like dirt.
Looks like food.
They'll come for me right away if I'm not there.  I have to go.
You're not cleared for this precinct.  Let's cross over first.
What?
On the cervix transfer, you almost lost the T297.
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
AH UGH.
But you can't.  We must escape.
Impossible!
Where is LUH?
I want you for my roommate.
You're in violation.
...and you're not lost now?
Look more closely.
...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...
Officer Reilly, vice.
One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol.
Go ahead.
Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
Thanks.
Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive.
Don't push it, slick.
Only once, at Redstone.
Drive.
You mentioned something called Redstone.
No, ninety-ninety percent of them are full of baloney. They're into the power trip, not the damage. What scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants, then disappear. The worst of the bunch, they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever... and they love the carnage.
Yep.
I don't know, it's strange... it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it. See, when you beat one of these things... 
How do you know?
Which one's which?
Bev, give `em a call, find out what bowling alleys they supply in this area.
Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon.
Stay here.
What? Nobody, I-
You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
Take your time... one day at a time, kid...
It's about this.
Captain assigned me to assist you.
I'll do it.
I know you're anxious to get back but... just stay out of homicide's way or I'll have you classifying fingerprints, understand?
Pull back. You're only an observer.
So you lost a handbag, madame?
Diamonds all over.
No!  But let me tell you--any woman who spends a fortune in times like these for a handbag--phooey, phooey, phooey!
At once, Jacques.  We'll continue later.
In a moment.
<u>Niente!</u>
No!
Umm.
Now see here, my good man. I've had just about enough of your insulting remarks!
Just dull.
Um-hum. Very good. Excellent!
And, waiter--you see that moon?
I don't want to see you at all!
You can trust me.
And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
Otherwise I'll call the police
Just call me Gaston.
No, thank you.
You're very welcome.  Countess, believe me, before you left this room I would have told you everything ... And let me say this with love in my heart-- Countess, you are a thief.  The wallet of the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine is in your possession. I knew it very well when you took it out of my pocket.  In fact, you tickled me.  But your embrace was so sweet ... 
Gaston!
And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--
Two fifty-three, five--
But it's not enough!
Certainly!
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
And in that niche, there is a statue of Venus.
Oh! You didn't read it!
Oh!
But one suggestion, madame.  Not the major.  I don't  mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  And one lipstick ...  Scarlet number four.
What shade of powder do you use?
Make it out to cash!
Right!
Isn't that wonderful!  You see, madame-- 
And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
Correct!  Good night.
Like that!
I know all your tricks.
Mariette!
What is it, madame?
No, madame, it's the way you <u>follow</u>.
No, m'sieu!
I know!
Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.
For all the really important things--
Right!
Then why did you do it?
That's right.
The pumps --
I'm tryin' boss.
A hundred and one next month.
Rose might not want to see this, Lewis.
Rush her.
Don't you mean work me?
...Mrs. Calvert?
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
Cal, stop! It was an accident.
I was tired.
Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your fiancee --
That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back...  ...I have a pretty good idea where to find the other.  Search him.
Get in... hurry up, it's almost full.
Ain't you boys ever rowed before? Here, gimme those oars. I'll show ya how it's done.
If you don't shut that hole in yer face, there'll be one less in this boat!
Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
Is he your boyfriend?
You wouldn'ta jumped.
You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
You're still my best girl, Cora.
I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
He does landscapes.
This is crazy.
It didn't seem like much of a bump. I'm sure we're okay.
Right.
You think she was really there?
Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me.
Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.
Sure! You're never at a loss for words.
Sooner--if you like.  See you again, I hope.
<U>Gladly</U>.
That depends on how mother's feeling. You'll excuse me, gentlemen?
How about giving me another coat?
Wait a minute!--They're dancing in the palm court--
Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.
You work too fast for me, young man.
Well--breakfast?  Lunch?
Very--your mother?
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
Lonesome?
You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.
Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
Looks like he's taking a trip--see the baggage? The only time they ever picked me up, McKinney walked through the room while they were grilling--let's see how good his memory is.
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
A dollar forty--out of the two dollars I gave you.
Thank you.  I owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.
Nooooo!--going to catch up on my reading.  I'll take this one.
You keep out of this--  You admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?
O.K. Heads you win.
Never mind--I'll pay for it now. It'll save time.
"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
Right. Here's eighty cents. Send it.
Yes--Me--in person!
Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.
Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am!
Guess they're dull--nothing for you to reform.
Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
Get that out of your trunk.
Good-night, folks.
Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--
Easy kid--easy....  Come on--I want to talk to you.
He works the boats as a "come-on" man. We ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. Jack's a pretty good dealer himself.
Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.
It wasn't smart. Even if you'd gotten away without me --I'd have found you--no matter where you were.
You can't bluff me any more.
--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
I wouldn't say that--  I'm glad he's dead--yes--I'd thought of killing him-- but I didn't--
Good night!
I mean if you knew it were stolen.
I sincerely hope so--
I hope so. Well, I guess you two can do without me. I'll be seeing you.
Thank you.
"Smooth's" the word.
Do you think Lother could have seen it?
Then why did you run away?
Isn't that a daisy?
Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper.
Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-
Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?
Well I'm the man to see.  Besides Sheriff I'm also tax collector, Captain of the Fire Brigade, and Chairman of the Non-partisan Anti- Chinese league.  A man of many Parts.  Got a place to stay yet?  I Also sit on the Townlot Commission.  Got a couple of Lovely cottages coming up for Rent.  Here, let me show you...
Oh, so that's it...
Absolutely nothing.
I saw that look pass between you And Wyatt at the fight.  Listen to Me!  You're mine!  Understand? You're my woman and I'm your man.
Come and get him.
Ecentus stultorum magister.
That's what I love about Wyatt. He can talk himself into anything.
Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself.
I imagine it would, yes.  So now We can add self-pity to your list Of frailties.
Good God, you're really-
Never even heard of anything like it.
Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are You happy?
Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.
Look, it's too much of a tangle. I already cast my lot.  I can't go Back and I can't sneak, feel back Enough as it is.
I forgave you the moment you said it.
Don't worry, Doc, it's not your problem. You don't have to mix up in this.
I think I'll just lie down awhile
Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.
I don't know.  I'm all right.
You wanted to talk?
Hope so.  Clean up with this boy.
Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I Don't know.
Yeah?
Fine.  Better.
What's it look like?  They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.
Morg, use your head.
Will somebody get the damn dog out-
Isn't true.  I can't see a damn thing.
That a fact?
That a fact?
Sure...
I can't hardly believe it.  It's Working out just like you said, Wyatt.  We're lootin' this burg Six ways through Sunday.
Kinda, actually, yeah.  I gotta admit.
Nothing to do with me?  I'm your Brother for Christ's sake.  God, I Don't believe this.  Talk to him, will you?  Or hit him.  Oh no, don't tell me...
Just stay calm, use your head. It'll be all right.  Just the Same, though...  Guess you better swear me in.
Bring up the tracking satellite. And get 007 out of there.
Sir Elliot.
...Words to live by?
Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of London.'  ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond?
Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -
I appreciate your time -
Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?
- We all want what we can't have?
Standard equipment. The world's automobile manufacturers seem to be in some kind of mad war to see who can provide the most beverage cup holders.
Nothing.
No! He's crazy - he's insane. He hates everybody. He's got these plans -  You've got to help me, James. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I know I was wrong - but you've got to protect me. I know you still love -
Just hold me.
Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
How is old Q?
Hey - the world is my office.
Something with an engine? Not oars?
Step into my office.
We work in the dark. We do what we can.
He tied one on.
Wait a minute -  I've got it. There! Off the port bow!
Happily.
I wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat.
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
Have we met?
And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
Nice to run into you again.
- The family jewels?
- You're not.
Thank you.  "Now hear this: Drop dead."
Listen to me! I'm a British secret service agent. And we have about two minutes before Harmsway kills both of us.
Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!
My father left me the business.
What do you mean?
Are you listening to me?
Of course.  Minister Johnstone.
Which is also why I've withheld this information from NATO and our allies.
Sabotage?
Indeed they are.  Deadly little things.
Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.
You leave me no alternative.
Good-day, Miss Winch. I advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground.
Yes -
Seems to be back to normal, sir.
Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
Don't worry. Mr. Bond will get the message. So will his boss.
Approaching the first gate.
...But because I am a just man, I've decided to give Mr. Hussein what he deserves.
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
Maybe I can get down there next week.
I told her I would if she would give me time.
You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son, it is always you, so you fix the roof.
I'm okay. Go back to your friends.
And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
It is just a regular card.
Go back to sleep.
Babe Brother is a poor boy.
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
You stay inside. I will see to them.
I don't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell. This cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at.
I'm worn out but won't you feel like you are taking in a stranger?
Well if you're sure, I won't be a bother. Oh, I don't sleep on no spring mattress. I always make myself a pallet on the floor.
You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.
You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story.
'Course, you could be right. Your sons are alive. All my sons are dead.
It hasn't been the years; it's been the men in her life.
You got to know everything, do everything, and be everything.
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
Well, you and your husband are special. Ya, Gideon tells me you do volunteer work to help feed the poor.
Why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? I remember when you weren't saved. That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road.
He should be caring. That is not too much to ask.
I thought you weren't old fashioned.
In some things. When we were children, there used to be an old man that came around and would snatch your soul if you didn't have something on you that didn't make a X.
Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.
I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.
Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!
Let's let Molly open one.
I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
Heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, I...
It's a long story, Bo.  I'll explain later.  Here, catch this!
Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
Trouble?!  Where?!
Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
Look at me!  I can't even fly out of a window!
Years of Academy training...wasted!!
Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.
We've got to get out of here...NOW.
Hold still, Buzz!
We're not aiming for the truck!
Whaddaya mean, you don't know?
I don't know!
Outta my way!  Here I come, here I come --
Of course Woody ain't worried! He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten!
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
Nothing.
No, no, no, wait!
Oh, how ya doin', Rex?
Yes SIR!
Juvenile intrusion!  Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!
Sid!!!
Huh?
No, Slink --
Got it.
There's not.
You're spoiling your pretty looks. Come here.
I didn't know about the puppets. It's a lot to take in, all at once.
Go away.
Ah, come on now!
Almighty Jove in the shape of a swan.
In my pocket.
It was only a mouthful!
Do you think we should take her up to bed?
You're late for breakfast.
You will believe me, because it's true.
Arnie, this is crazy.
What is he being charged with?
You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.  We get Adler and we beat this thing.
Have you gone crazy?  You are not Carl.  You aren't as good as Carl.  They are moving the trial to a high security location.  The press has gone berserk.  The jury will be influenced.  Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case.
It's the same.  What happened to what they gave you?
What?
It's so frustrating.
So's the video camera.
At least she's alive.
I don't know.
How well do you know this boy, Seth, who was driving?  You know the police have charged him with a DUI and possession of marijuana.
Helena --
Do you work?
You do?  What else you do?
No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
She knows Arnie Metzger.
You want to make a wager on this?
Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.
Not Tiger Woods.
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
There's always a way.  If people get to the Pope or the President, you can get to him.
What are you?  A mouse?  Get out of the car and do it.  This is your chance.
So you pay off our customs officials?
That thought makes me feel awful.
The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. I wish you could see how transparent you are.  This food tastes like shit.
I don't know.  Perhaps I remember something.
Fine, then we don't have deal.
It should be... It's yours.  I want our debt forgiven.  I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States.  And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.
She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.
We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
If I can.
What is it you want me to do?
Is it possible to have a Drug Czar in Mexico who isn't connected in some war to one of the cartels?
The worst serial killer in history - who?  Gacy - right?  Killed forty two people.  Our government killed fifty thousand in Vietnam and lied about it every day.
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
I have money --
We sometimes went downtown to score.
Hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem.
Right.  Now it's used by somebody from the Juarez Cartel, one of his lieutenants...  Who knows?  Every damn day there's birthday party. At first I thought they must have three hundred children, then I realized they're taunting us.  Three miles away and we can't touch them. Ha, ha, ha.
I don't know.  I don't think there's any one person.  See the problem is the Juarez cartel owns everything and everybody, all the property on the Mexican side, sometimes all the property on both sides.  Warehouses, transportation, even tunnels.  It's very organized.
Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.
Can you not go yourself.
Jesus.
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
What's your name?
It's where I live.
Ssshh!
Sorry.
Jesus.
Easy for you to say.
Can I see you again?
Well, it isn't.
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
I'm an old boy myself, you know?
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
No, I'll wash them. I'll take them home and bring them back.
Well, sub us, then, mate. I'm expecting a rent cheque.
Yeah.
Nineteen-sixty-seven.
Lewis Gilbert.
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
Roald Dahl. Fuck me.
OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?
Fuck you.
I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.
There's a mate of swanney's. Mikey Forrester -- you know the guy. He's come into some gear. A lot of gear.
Sorry, boys, I don't have two thousand pounds.
Well, it's up to you.
That's hardly a substitute.
Your favourite dish.
Sounds great, Swanney.
Such as?
Such as sitting in a darkened room, watching videos, drinking, smoking dope and wanking. Does that answer your question?
Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.'
A walk.
No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --
Magnificent. You are the first to find me.
DO it. Go to Red Alert.
Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.
I instruct you to surrender. You are under attack by Federation forces.
Oh, please.
What do you know of my pain?
Aye, Captain  How many times do I have to tell you? The right tool for the right job...
I hope it won't come to that, Mr. Scott.
Then we'll have to get them out the old fashioned way.
Mr. Scott, you're amazing.
ER... You forgot to take it with you.
Go, Sulu.
I do not think you realize the gravity of your situation.
I believe Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods.
Spock, I appreciate your concern, but if you don't stop distracting me, I'm liable to be one...
That's great. I haven't sung around a campfire since I was a boy in Iowa. What are we going to sing? What... Bones, what are we going to sing?
Yes.
There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.
No, no, no, Captain. You do not understand. Sybok also in a son of Sarek.
I have a half brother.
I gotta sit down.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
Fire the rockets!
The emergency channel, open.
It's all right, Captain.  Proceed.
You staged all this to get your hands on my ship?
Now learn something about yourself.
Because you, too, must know.

Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
Uhura, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt that a madman had taken over the Enterprise.
Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.
Are you embezzling?
You haven't told him?
Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...
Flynn had Group 7 access.
I want to go to his place.
I mean I want both of us to go.
To warn him.
Of what?
Yes...but you have to go roundtrip, and you must purchase your program at least 30 days in advance. Hah!
They'll start to soon enough.
No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on?
The Pentagon?
Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
What do you want with the Pentagon?
If you think -
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
You know anybody that's got an army for rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said to go take that sucker out. An' let's face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any weaker. I feel like hittin' him now, while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve... what does he care whether you guys get killed, long as he keeps rakin' in quarters?
It's time I levelled with you, Tron. I'm a -- well, I'm what you guys call a User.
You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever.
How about you?
Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
Good luck. You can't even think in here.
You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
Then pull yourself together. Get this clown trained. I want him in the Games until he dies playing.
I'm not sure what to believe anymore, young lady.  You never used to lie to me.  But lately you don't seem to know the difference between right and wrong.
Okay.  Here she comes.
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
It can't be.
I still don't believe it.
Relax.  Helen still loves you. She just wants this guy to bang her.  It's nothing serious. You'll get used to it after a --
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
It's show time.  Don't look at					* the flash.  Do not look at the flash.
God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
Oral hygiene?
Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
Good thinking, honey.
It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.
They must've just missed me.
They said you had to run out.
Not because you were attracted to him?
He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
Why?
What did you need?
Louder please.
Oh yeah?  Oh yeah?  Then where did I get this?
What?
Sure.  Set me up and then don't tell me.
Some kinda legal secretary of something.  Married to some boring jerk.
No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot me.
Ssshhh!  We say Op.  Covert					* operation.  And this one got a little rough.
Cairo was a day at the beach next				* to this.
Sometimes a story is a mask for a covert operation.  See-- two men killed in a restroom, and two unidentified men in a running					* shootout, ending at the						* Marriot...
Something came over me, I just had nail him, no matter what the				* risk.  It was pretty hairy.  I thought he had me, a couple of					* times.  But I really can't take credit .  .  .
What is it you need me to do?
How?
Use the gifts that Allah has given you.
I can't wait to meet you. Clarence told me all about you. He said you were his best friend. So, I guess that makes you my best friend, too.
You can't have just one.
Almost four years.
I'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what I'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most of the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.
That's a "Rookies" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls. They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in "The Black Hole"? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.
You didn't do nothing.
I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.  I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that comic book place.
Who?
Who and what is a Drexl?
You better not be fucking teasing me.
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
You don't know me. Not when it comes to shit like this. I have to do this. I need for you to know you can count on me to protect you. Now write down the address.
Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did.
What?
Why Cancoon?
That rhymes.
I heard that.
In fact, I'm gonna show you what I mean with a little demonstration. Big D, toss me that shotgun.
You don't like it, but you eat that shit.  He eats it.
Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.
Killin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find who done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. If you don't get caught at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it.
I'm her husband.
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
What's so fuckin' good about it? Actresses are the most fucked-in-the-head bunch of women in the world. It's like they gotta pass a test of emotional instability before they can get their SAG card. Oh, guess what? I had a really good reading for "T.J. Hooker" the other day.
You don't meet him in the audition. That comes later. Hope, hope.
For the very first time in my life.  Do you know what that's like?
Look, Clarence, I'm not Joe Cocaine.
The zoo.  What are you waiting for?
Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?
In case of what?
No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it. How 'bout you, Bama?
The police department?
Get on your knees.
Why does he trust you?
I can, but I don't.
You don't know the chicken places around where you live?  Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is.
Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always "OK", "No problem", "You're a busy guy, I understand". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.
No shit?
I give up. Who are you?
I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.
No.
Uh-huh.
It's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you don't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago the Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then, Sicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But, once the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did so much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for ever, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it absolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, Sicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a fact. It's written. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, great, great-grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. That is a fact. Now tell me, am I lyin'?
You and Robin moved?
Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.
But a fuckin' baggie.
No don't sit here and feed us some shit.
You got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now we gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time -
Or a supporting actor -
How's he supposed to see the wire?
You ain't seen nothin' like these rock whores. They ass be young man. They got that fine young pussy. Bitches want the rock they be a freak for you. They give you hips, lips, and fingertips.
Naw, man, it ain't white boy day.
Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.
They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.
Put it in your pants.
Do you know where we can find him?
We have a very advanced program, something very different, requires very skilled people.
You're still a little... disoriented.
And it appeared sequentially after that in...?
Uh, so that a vaccine can be developed that will, uh, allow mankind to reclaim the surface of the earth.
No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information.
You've been in an institution, haven't you, James?  A hospital?
A jail?  Prison?
What's wonderful about the air, James?
What year is it?
1995 is the future, James.  This is 1989.
It's the next step.  I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone.  Zs that a radio?  Does it play music?
I'm not going to "do" anything, I promise.  But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is.
The man...with the voice.  I recognized him.  He's from the present.  He...
Jeffrey Mason?
First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?
The gun! ... I lost it
No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said.
I couldn't resist.  I was so relieved. Wait'll they hear this nutty woman telling them...they better watch out for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys...
I remember you...like this.  I feel I've known you before.  I feel I've always known you.
In the 18th century there was no such thing!  Nobody'd ever imagined such a thing -- no sane person anyway.  Along comes this doctor...Semmelweiss, I think.  He tries to convince people... other doctors mostly...that there are these teeny tiny invisible "bad things" called germs that get into your body and make you...sick!  He's trying to get doctors to wash their hands.  What is this guy...crazy?  Teeny tiny invisible whaddayou call 'em?..."germs"!
A lawsuit?  You going to sue them?
You do know me.  You helped me once.
I'm here about some monkeys.
Listen to me -- I can't do anything about what you're going to do. I can't change anything.  I can't stop you.  I just want some information...
We'll get to the spider later, Mr. Cole.  Right now, we want to know everything that you saw.
He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?
You really want to know?
No!  Absolutely not. Don't tell me anything.
No, thank you.
Twelve Monkeys, honey.  Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning.
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
More or less.
We all got plans.  I planned on seeing all my life.  I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
Never heard of it.  It's got no day or date.  Hell, it ain't even got numbers.  What's the matter?  You couldn't afford a Timex?
I need a ticket.
One way, or round trip?
You Harlin?
Yep.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Somewhere else?  Mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here.  How you planning on getting it there? You gonna push this heap yourself?
Don't look like nothing.
How much?
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
What?
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
Yeah, but it was shot.
I'm taking my car, and I'm taking it now!
Kirin?
Genuine Draft?
Yeah, give me the Miller.
'Cept that she lost her money and the sons of bitches stole her wedding ring.  That's when she started shooting.  Can't blame her. The ring was all Carlos left her when he died.
Yes.  Yes it is.
He killed him, Sheriff!  I couldn't stop him!  He made me come with him. He told me if I said a word he would kill me too.
Don't tell him anything.  He can't do this.
Wrong number.
I'm just going to my car.
Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
You should be more careful.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways.  I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
'Course they cost a little more than I should really be spending.  But, damn it, I don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself.  I deserve nice things.
You're not from around here, are you?
You've been around.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some work there.
I couldn't stay in this place.  I wouldn't.  I'd just pick up, do whatever I had to do, and get out.
Thank you.
Come here.
Still playing?
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
You could just leave him.
Yeah.
Is it pretty?
Jesus Christ!  Listen to yourself! I can't do it, Grace.  I can't do it.
I've thought about you every second since I left.  I can still taste you on my lips.
You could have hit him, or kneed him in the balls.
I told you.  I knew it was there. Didn't I tell you?
What about him?
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep in the garage.  Figure that way people will think maybe me and Jake went away.  Might buy us some time.
Grace!  Just . . . let me handle this.  Sheriff, I'm telling you there's nothing in that trunk.  If that's not good enough for you, then I'd be happy to open it.  Just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant.
I think you're a lying, back stabbing bitch.  But it's nice to know you care.
I'm here.
It's . . . it's locked.
No.  I swear it.
Yeah, they'll find you.  Dried up and twice dead.
For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!
Fuck you!  Do you hear me, John!? Fuck you!  John . . . John!?
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
Is this what it's all about?  You sucker me up here so you can watch the two of us beat the shit out of each other over you?  Forget it.  You want to take my head off, Mister, I won't even try to stop you.  I deserve it for being an idiot.  But if you're not, I think I'll be on my way.
I hope so.  Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit. Do you know why?  Because you're a man without scruples.
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were.  I can tell you got a temper on you.
I do all right.  Real estate isn't a bad game such as it is around here. The trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it, and overvalue when you sell.  You can turn a few dollars that way.
About things.  About your wife.
What makes you say that?
How much could you get?
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.
SHUT UP!
Maybe you heard old Jake's got some money stashed away and you thought you'd help yourself to a little.
And then with Jake out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars.  Or maybe two-thousand.  Or twenty-thousand.  Who's to stop you? Not Jake McKenna, 'cause old Jake would be dead.
I came for Grace.
Sense?  If I had any sense I would have killed you this morning and been done with it.
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of.
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
She's dead.
For defending my honor this afternoon.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
What's your name anyway?
That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
You expect me to believe that?
They're not very imaginative?
No.  He gets shot by the old lady.
A hundred-forty-five really.
Yes, Mr. Vesci.
Nope.  No problems up the road.
Sure, Sheriff.
There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.
Soda.  You know.
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
Christ no!
See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...I miss him.  I'll see ya later, unless I come across something worse.
Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.
Well, people gotta get by somehow. That's the curse. The mines done it. All that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that "om"! Everybody's got a mother. You don't rip up your mother. You don't rip up the Earth and take everything out. It's like the Cracker Jack box says, "the more you eat, the more you want...."...
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
You expect me to believe that?
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
Accident.
Would you kill her?
And what does that make you?
Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead...  Well, looks like we got ourselves a contract.
And tell her what?
It's not what you think, Jake.
...And he thought he'd clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper...and then maybe borrow $200 or $20,000, or $200,000...
You came to take my wife from me?
For what?
Great!
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
Listen to me you sorry sonufabitch. You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it.  And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on it. Is that clear? Now get out of here 'fore I call the Sheriff, <u>who knows me</u>.
That's none of your business.  Get the keys.
No.
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
What happened to your hand?
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
That's all right.  I got it.
You're not from around here, are you?
So, what is it you do, Mister...?
Those are white words, not ours.
It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
Like you.
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
Is that why you're with him?
I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
Yeah.
At night. He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more.
What about us?
I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.
Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past...
Don't you really want to know? Was Jake my Daddy? Was I fucking my own Daddy? Don't you want to know that?
And love's a funny thing.  Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you...
Sounds like it. I wish I could help Sheriff, but I just want to get my car and get on up the road.
...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
No Beck's. A-1, Coors...
No, we ain't got no Heineken.  We got Miller.
I think I burned my gun hand!
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.
Vat? I am going 5 miles an hour! I am looking town. I not even moving.
No sir he is not.  I read about you in the paper.
Wow.
No.
I'll keep it in my office room.
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal.
Not often, but it is possible. Most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits. They don't know how long the shadow really is. They don't know how far away the real limits are standing... They stop out of fear.
Yes.
out again?
We're supposed to be honest.
I had a nightmare one night and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay.  I think that was the first time.  Does that count?
Skeptical about what?
Is there a problem?
That guy in green. Sometimes people carry weapons in here. Then they drink too much. They're team isn't doing so well, bad things happen... We do random pat downs of the crowd to discourage people from carrying.  If he's carrying, he'll step out of line.
Telling when people have done something wrong?
The car accident you were in... Was there anyone else involved?
I never said you couldn't be killed. I never said that.
He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
There's a message for you at the office. Your kid was hurt.
Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.
No.
What if he wasn't aloud to kick and you were really mad at him?
Get mom.
You're lying.
Fine.
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition.
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
You told them cowboys you had it.
We was... lyin'.
Ha. He was building his fucking porch.
Don't matter, we don't need no whips.  Spring comes an' Skinny don't have them ponies, I'm gonna...
Nope.
Didn't give us nothin' but his own name... Ned Roundtree.
You don't look nothin' like me, mister.
I didn't mean no offense.  I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up.  Ned an' The Kid, my partners, are they... ?
Been a long time, Bob. You run out of Chinamen?
I could run off them whores.
Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
Meaning the duck himself, I guess.
You were there?
Some folks did call Old Corky "Two Gun" but not because he was sportin' two pistols but because he had a dick so big it was longer than the barrel on that Walker Colt he carried. An' the only insultin' he done was stickin' that big dick of his in some French Lady that Old Bob was sweet on... Well, one day Corky walked into the Blue Bottle and before he knows what's happening Bob takes a shot at him... and misses on account of he's drunker than hell.
And?
Then he will kill you. That is why there are so few dangerous men like old Bob there... an' like me. It ain't so easy to shoot a man anyhow... an' if the sonofabitch is shootin' back at you... well, it'll unnerve most fellas.  Look here, let me show you somethin'.  See this here pistol?
Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went South yesterday. He didn't even kill nobody. Why would anybody kill Ned?
Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
A sign on him?
Then... what?
Maybe I ain't.
She's passed on, Kid.
Huh?
Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
You missed him? You didn't...?
Shut up, Kid.
He's in there.
Yup.
We all got it comin', Kid.
Well, you don't wanna trust me too much. We'll take Ned his share together so you don't figure I run off with it.
Lemmee see it.
I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
You sure you ain't armed?
Yeah, an' I could still hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
Sally?
Well, she...
You was a... a crazy sonofabitch.
Naw. I bumped my head fallin' off of my horse.
Kid? The Kid's shootin at us?
Why would the Kid shoot at us?
Easy, Bill, easy.
Two.
We got to kill this other one first.  Shit, Ned, if we're lucky, we could kill him by nightfall... or maybe tomorrow morning. Then we could head back, all three of us, with the money.
You gonna share your half with him?
More.
Yeah.
He says they were buying It doesn't make sense. I'm sorry, I'm a little rusty. They were there to buy something.
No good. He needs guarantees. He says... his life is in danger... He has seen the Devil... looked him in the eye.
I'm having a stroke.
Time for what, Edie? Time to look into me a little more, that's what. No matter how well you cover my tracks now, they'll find out who I am.
No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished.
You are a criminal.
RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.
They fucking know everything.
Hurt you, you sonofabitch? I could kill you.
McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
Who's Keyser Soze?
I work for Keyser Sate.
Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.
Edie Finneran. She is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition. I requested she be put on the case personally. She flew out yesterday.
A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis.
This won't be an' interrogation, just a... friendly chat to kill time.
Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. He was using her.
Come on. Keaton was a cop for four years. Who else would know the Taxi Service
I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York.
What call?
I don't.
THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN.
He programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to. Customs has been
Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you.
I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop.
Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.
Very good.
Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.
You thought it was just.
What is the truth?
It looks that way.
Don't equivocate.  Be positive. Just tell the truth.
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not?
Yes.
Tell me one?
My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...
No, I am not.  It's quite common in New York State...
No.
I know of him.
What book is that?
...of Anesthesiology?
Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
And wasn't that an oath...?  These are your initials here:  K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath.  No less important than that which you took today.   Isn't that right?   Isn't that right...?
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?
You know these doctors could have settled out of court.  They wanted a trial.  They wanted to clear their names.
`They lied.'  Indeed!  When did they lie?  And do you know what a lie is?
That's not my handwriting.
You didn't write that figure.  And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
Because I kept a copy.  I have it right here.
It's completely done on a contingency basis.  That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third ...that is, of course, the usual arrangement ...
Hold on a second.
Is that what a good doctor would do?  How old are you, please?
It's a common medical term.
Well...
I...um...
It's my opinion it took him much longer.  Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
No.  No thank you, Doctor.  You go home.
Yes?  Galvin, right?
Her doctors murdered her.  They gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.    Her doctors murdered her.
Do you know who her doctors were?
Okay.  I'll meet you here.  Tuesday night ... I gotta go.  You going my way?
No.
And ask me what?
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
...things change.
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
Thank you for seeing me.
That's perfectly all right.
I'd just like to get to the point, Mr. Galvin.  Let's not waste these people's time.  Answer the question, Mr. Witness.  Please.  Would a nine-minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence?
Mr. Alito, please.
This is Miss Costello...?
We find that your subscription lapsed...
Yes, we know that you do.  I have it in my files.  That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
You just got lucky.   D'you eat yet?  Come on.
Maybe what?
What...?
What happened...?
I've got to work.
You're going to stay here...?
That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.
I...
It's over!
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
What is that to you...?
Stop pressuring me...
... I get these people to trust you --they're coming here tomorrow by the way --I get this expert doctor to talk to you.  I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months.  You're 'sposed to be in court.  I bet you haven't even seen the file.
Come on.  Let's get a drink.
To do what...?  To do what, for chrissake...?   To help her to do what?  She's dead...
Frank, but not now.  Frank.  You're trying to wipe out some old business.  But not now.  I understand.  But you go call 'em back.  You call the Bishop back.
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
I can't talk now.
I think we tried that.  The case is over.
It's locked?
... I'm sure you do ...
Hi.  How are you doing?
How old is he?
Four.  You're great with these kids.
Yes...
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
You don't have to do it for a living.
No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.
How long have you been back?
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?
Well?
Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.  Scottie --
Scottie, I need a friend!  Someone I can trust! I'm in a panic about this!
But you knew about this.
Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
You won't have to.
Judy Barton.
Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
Yes.
All right. Then I'll do it. Because I don't care about me anymore. I just want you to love me.
Is that the best you can do?
I'm going to have one of those big beautiful steaks.  And... let's see... to start...
But why? Why here?
So am I, But it has to be done. I have to tell you about Madeleine, now.
You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.
Yes!
Look at the scene of the crime. Go on in.
And the necklace. Carlotta's necklace. That was your mistake, Judy. One shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing. You shouldn't have been that sentimental.
Do you remember where you were?
Oh, that's a lovely spot, isn't it? I've never been inside. But it looks so lovely, driving past.
My name is John Ferguson.
No... it's wrong.
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
Meet again, sometime.
Good-bye.
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
How can you be sure?
And no birds sing.
No, thank you.
Madeleine!
Have you been here before?
No!
What?!
No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
There was a village square, a green with trees... and an old whitewashed Spanish church with a cloister. Across the green: a big, grey, wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above... a small garden, and next to it, a livery stable... with old carriages lined up inside.
Too late... there's something I must do...
You can't.
Oh, no! She hasn't been here at all! I would have seen her, you know. I've been right here all the time, putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves!
I had to quit, Midge.
I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
Oh!
Aren't you ever going to get married?
Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?
I've got a theory. Look. If I can get used to heights just a little at a time... progressively see?
This is a cinch. I look up, I look down. I look up --
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?
Who?
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
I'll take you home.
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
You're interrupting a personal conversation.
No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.
I have plenty of friends.
I set up Fisher with the broker that found his house. Took care of that one, didn't I?  Prison Communications.
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...
She's got bondage burns on her wrists. There's blow all over the room, Moore looks like he went at it with a mountain lion. This room looks like the Manson Family stayed here a month. Micheal goes down, we all go down.
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
They won't figure it out.
They're screaming like monsters and it's giving me a headache. Go get some fucking Starbursts.
I know you'll be.  Three hours.
No...we want padded chairs...okay?
No. I think it's fucked.
What.
Don't sweet lip me.
You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
I don't want to hear it from the liar. Stick a plug in it Boyd. Fisher? What happened in Vegas?
Where is she?
I'm just gonna let her know I'm here.
Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir.
We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place...and put her in the ground.
What is her disposition?
She's dead. Call somebody!
I'm talking about prayer.
What?
Exactly! Exactly my point.
I don't know...
I'm getting really tired of your bullshit.
My what?
You're sick.
Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
Ball park sausages.
Easy Micheal.
All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything?
Government cutbacks.
Sent it.
Yes.
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.
He's weird. And I expect more from you.
I've seen it on television.
Okay.
I need your help.
I'll call them from the road.
Maybe.
Have a nice bachelor party.
How late?
I'm working on it.
After the wedding, which we're paying for ourselves, and this house...
I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
Okay. Okay.
What money?
What does that mean?
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, "My son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me...My boy is just like me." Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me.
OK, OK. You guys just go back in. Dad, keep going with the toast, we'll be right in. Go on.
He's your brother.
The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter...and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for...You get me?
I've been looking for that flash and I look and I look and I can't find it. And what if I already had it? You know. My moment? What if it's gone? And I never saw it?  You're getting married, man. That's a fucking beautiful thing. Just a beautiful thing. I just can't stop breaking beautiful things.
No. No. No. This is my doing. You see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own. For Lois and the kids, for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna turn myself in. I am all that. I'm gonna do it for sweet Lois.
How do you know she's dead.
Did she believe you?
Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?
That's a good one.
I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think?
The stone age.
So where to on the honeymoon?
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
Then I'll get you in the fields tomorrow ...
Then it's a respectable house.
What about them?
I'm well ... The bus was late, wasn't it? ... What was the journey like?
To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
Who is she?
You see, even the voice.
You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
And this innocent child.
Today I can refuse you nothing.
No, it's true.  Last night when you were sleeping, I had you all to myself.
Thank you; but it's missing something.
He was asking for it.
Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ...
Why do you say that? Perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous.
No, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion.
I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.
I think I'd better go tomorrow.
There's plenty of money in this house. Piles of it.
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
Are you Jorge?
Well... is it so urgent?
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.
Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.
Why?
How much do you want for him?
Don't say that.
Come with me.
Don't invent stories; go to bed.
Yes!
Don't pay any attention to him. It's very good.
) There is one program with approximately 1.3 million lines of programming. It is thoroughly secured, which is not surprising considering Lindenmeyer created it.
Jesus Christ.  I know who the dominant personality is.  Lindenmeyer.
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
Got it.
Not if you're with him every step of the way.
Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?
Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?
I'M WHAT?!
I know.  I'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile. If you want to experience the future, meet me in my office in 15 minutes. And bring the Sheila 3.2 character module with you...
Of course you are.
Help me get out of here.
I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please!
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
Enough!
He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.
Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers.  Stay here.
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
How did you get your hand out?
Thanks.
That's why I'm asking.
You won't want to watch. Turn around.
Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
My...secret.
As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.

They insist they wanna go with meeting him at the airport.  I told'em they're wrong, I can't convince'em. They're concerned that the last kid had the <u>Wheat</u>. Variations include, the kid is a <u>boy</u>, the kid is <u>twins</u>, it's a little <u>dog</u> ... they rub meat on Schumann's cuff, the dog runs to him...
Cause I don't think <u>this</u> dog is gonna hunt....
Yeah, well, perhaps...  Speaking of which:  I have a <u>prescription</u> here, I'm going to give you the <u>number</u>, I need you standing by with a <u>crate</u> of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?
Eh?  I'm like the Rest of America.  I don't <u>care</u> -- I'm just <u>addicted to it</u>...
Come on, Pal, come on Willie, come on, Old Shoe...
No, I'm fine... I got it together....
No problem.  Here's the...
Eighty-<u>nine</u> percent favorable, is based not on <u>events</u>...
Yes. 
...for the beans, yes...
That's right, we'll take a nap.  We'll get you to Washington, we'll get you Back to your Buddies, and...
...just want to Get Back to the Beans...
SUSIE...?  Are you alright...?
I'll grow old. We'll both die. And we'll never have known each other. That's sad. At least one drink for a dreamer...What's your favorite drink?
Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
...takes years of genetics, pal, and a Yale education... and the right tailor.
Cheer up buddy buddy. You shook Gekko the Great's hand and you still got all your fingers. He's not the only elephant in the jungle.
I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it.
You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right? You're a salesman.
Sure I'm sure. Buddy, you got that mischievous look in your eyes. You used to smile just like that when you were a baby sleeping, just like that.
Look Dixon, calm down! It's not illegal to buy stock or to be right. And it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment.
What was that?
Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...
You're just the President of the company, what do you know? ... Come on.
Oh no, no...
...going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal.
...Yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff.
Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
I remember that deal. You were involved?
Inside information. Oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline? Or someone overhears me saying I'm gonna buy Teldar Paper? Or the chairman of the board of XYZ suddenly knows it's time to blow out XYZ. You mean that?  I'm afraid sport, unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company, you and I are gonna have a hard time doing any business...
Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.
I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why?
Obviously...
Are you with me Buddy?
Excuse me.
Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink.
Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.
Yeah, almost...
The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
Well, why stop at that?
I'll let you know.
I figure a guy who's made some mistakes should be able to understand a girl who's made some of her own...
Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
No, are you crazy? And I don't want him ever to know. Do you understand?...
Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?
Ooh ooh, tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package. Does this mean you're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own? Because, Darien, if you're through with me, you're through with everything I'm a part of.
Yeah 
So why are you dating Jonathan?
What's that?
A party at a waxwork huh?
They seemed, closing by much 
Like her?  I don't know if I ever liked her.  It's just you want what you can't get.
I know what you mean.
You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.
Big deal!
Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.
This. is killer.
Never fear, Tony is here.  Ladies first.
Hey.
Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
You're joking.
Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.
Toward the end.  You remember?
This really isn't a good time.
For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
What?
I couldn't catch my breath.  That's not a metaphor, that's...And I panicked.  I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there...  I tried to leave him.  Went to my mother's in Boston.  He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home.
I'd like to talk to you about Madison.
She never mentioned you.
Anyway, Claire slept with him...
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
Do we have to?
She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.
You got it.
Jody, no...
I don't...
No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
This.
Something was there.  You saw it.
I was down in Adamant...
What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
Nope.
Mmm.
Why?
But what if something happens?
I'd never be able to live with mysel--
I know.
No, no.  It's fine.
I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
That's...
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
Did you tell her?
Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?
Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...
I never said...
Yes.  And he's going to get away with it.
Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
You know what I've got at stake with this paper.  You know that.  I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow.
I felt you...looking through me...
The...
STOP IT!
Who?
Your wife...
Who?
I'm not going to listen to this.
Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.
I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it.
Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
Huh.
I know.
:Would you stop it!
But you've not told Michael.
Two what...?
With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.
Rowan.
Nothing was ever more false.
Every day  twice.
Giff - shuttup.    you're mother was a sweet child, Rowan... A lost little girl in a world too full at things
When did she die...?
Yes.    Listen carefully, Rowan. Have your attorney contact me at once. There are matters of immediate -
What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
A Mayfair it ever I saw one.
I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -
The lamplight.  That's all.
You're a monster.
Why are you doing this...?  Handing out these horrors! Why...?!!
But I had to use my hands.  None before you could kill with their mind.  Graham, my dear.  Your uncle...?
I 1ove you, Rowan.  I've always loved you.  I only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your thoughts - so I could be as we are now.
It you harm Michael, I will let my anger loose.  And you will feel that. Do you understand...?
I love Michael...
They want to come back.    We have a pact - of mutual desire and  consent.  The Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry.  I have weaved you all together - from the start.   I brought Petyr Van Abel to Suzanne.  He had genius in him.  Scientific, precise.  It was a perfect start. And on  it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter...
Harder...
I guess so.  The trick is remembering how to act like one.  I'm glad you called, Mr. Curry. I wanted to see you.  Why don't we go to my office...
Then call it in. Mr. Curry. Whatever's happeninq to you - death is not the preferable alternative.  I'm in the life business - remember..?
Rowan...
What're you - a mindreader...?  Who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?
It's come to that, huh...?  Three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...?
All I meant was -
I'm serious.  You don't -
Michael - this place is increadible.  You - you're brilliant...  The things you created...
Guess so.    I keep thinking about the witches - when I was... down there    There was - caring.  They saved me, Ro.  They said 'go back'...  Wel1-  I came back - to you - to love you.  I like seeing it that way, y'know...?
A little wine...?
Dropped it.
Mm-hmm...
That's cause we're below sea level.
Your beneficence.
Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
As long as you get the HACKSAW piece done by FRIDAY... FRIDAY?
Why don't you take a few weeks off - you're due some holiday time.
Don't mention it - now can I get back to my accounts, or do you want to fillet me?
No -it's no problem - I do it all the time
No - I've been abroad for a long time...
What's with all the locks - and hammering
Yes - I'm sorry ELLEN...
Where do you kill them...
What did you do with her?
I don't know...
Nothing could be better...
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
LESLIE I'm sorry - I - I didn't know what to think
No - a dentist
Don't worry about it -
Yes - of course.
She smiles at everyone, Ted.  She's like a newborn with gas.
Maybe he got promoted.
For a guy about to try his first Dom Perignon, you are extremely uptight.
Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.
And like every hamburger guy knows, when you get your one big chance at the good life, you abuse every second of it until they figure out you don't belong there and kick your sorry ass out.
Perv.
Be cool. Fake it if you have to.
Dead?
Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.
Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.
And some really fast cars.
It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.
Yeah, he's probably been serving cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the orgies.
No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.
We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.
We reinvented ourselves.
And I was wondering.
Yeah?
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
Which you pulled, hard!
That was code for "I like you."
We're grateful, Ted. It's not that. Those Craftsman tools...they're a dream come true.
That's me.
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
Then remember, you are the heir to a billion dollar empire. You have a staff of literally thousands. Multiply everything you ever imagined by a million and you still can't even wrap your head around everything that is yours. ALL YOURS.
Hang in there, I'll think of something.
You mean they knew who I was?
They kept this scrapbook of your life. It meant the world to them.
She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.
You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
--Do it. I triple-dog-dare you.
Then I'll write about YOU.
"Local boy inherits more money than god." Call me crazy, but I smell human interest.
I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort.
A little respect would be nice, that's all.
It's all so complicated.
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
That's refreshingly deviant.
Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.
Like take that trip to Buckingham Palace. Go deep sea fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Now's your chance.
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire?
Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to a higher power.
A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.
Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me. First you break our school board rules. Then you break the law.
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
As much as possible.
Just a couple of finishing touches. My parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression.
The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually...
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second.
I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.
... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...
I'd like that.
Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
He used to come around here.  He had a thing going with one of the girls over at the Glades.
No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.
Was there ever any kind of investigation...
I know you do.
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house.  There's phones there.  I cruised the place, but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found.  I don't know... Maybe I should have called.  But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself.  I figured we'd just take it up on Monday, in the office.
Still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her.  I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt?
Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't imagine he gives a shit now.
Just check out the car.
What was that?
Bit, scratched.  But I had her pinned. She calmed down.  I was going to cuff her... She said she thought she was going to be sick.  She asked to use the bathroom.
I wanna go home now.
Hey, you're working for it.  Least you're supposed to be.
Hi, Mon.
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...
Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
That's right.
It doesn't look like it.
Shut up.
Yes.
The bitch shot me, is what happened.
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
Come off it, man... It was an accident.
Jesus.  Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change.
No, no.  Look, I probably should have told you a little more, about the part I intended to play.  We'll go through it all again tonight.
We?
To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday.
Jim West.
Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same.  Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir.  And best of luck in all your future endeavors.
Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
You really enjoy yourself, don't you?
Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
Where have you been?
In the next two minutes?
What is this?  A whole new train?
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
You tell me.
I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.
I've had some practice.
My friend?
That'll be all, boys.
It is?
You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.
Gimme a sword, Airk.  I'll win your war for you.
Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin.
I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
Why not?
You're not a woman.
Say what?
He turned that monster into stone!
I will!  But I need help!
As above, so below.
Good.  How long will it take?
I don't know.
These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
Are you a warrior?
You hear trouble.
I hate this.
You don't know anything about ba- bies.
Time to leave.
You?
She's a bird, Willow.
Ahhh!
No!
What do I need for that?
I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it?
What's the magician's weapon?
Shhhhh!
Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any- way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's go home.
Queen Cherlindrea?
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
How do these work I wonder?  I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin.
Good, you start tomorrow.
Guess I'm not used to so much.
Yes, sir.
Tell you what – I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
Who else knows?
Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at Treasury. I'll take care of it.  I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their balls off for me. I'm counting on you.
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.
I can't.
Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
Can I have something to drink?
Something wrong with buttons?
Quaint? Can't imagine why.
Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
I'm leaving tonight.  I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun.
You didn't have to...
Looks dead...
Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?
You are acting like one!
He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
Tight. But I'm working on him.
They don't have any shit.
Find Fergie, check the barns. I'll watch these two.
I wish dawdie was with us.
Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
Well, Dorothy was walking along the --
All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --
Is morally, ethic'ly
Who are you?
Oh ....
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
Now what happened? I'll bet Hunk did that.
Yes, I'm all right.  Oh -- I fell in and -- and Zeke --
Oh, please give me back my dog!
That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.
Well, I'm a little muddled.  The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.  And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
Oh.  But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
I have?
Do you know any?  Oh, you mean the thing -- Yes, well, I -- I never do anything without consulting my crystal first. Let's....
But you couldn't have been, could you?
No --
My mouth -- my mouth!
Oh...
Now come on - you're acting silly -- 
Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nose bleeding?
You're right -- I am a coward.
Hah!
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
I'd like to roar 'em down -- But I think I lost my roarer.
Did they hurtcha?
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
Oh -- does it hurt you?
Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
Leave her alone!
Don't you start it, too!
I don't know.
That's right.
All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy -- Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch -- guards or no guards -- I'll tear 'em apart.  I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.  There's only one thing I want you fellows to do.
Oh, scared, huh?
Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!
Imposserous!
Hold still - hold still --
I'd be clever as a gizzard --
Hurry -- hurry --
Emerald City!
Oh -- now look at him!  This is terrible!
I can fairly hear my heart beating!
We'll get you together!
Oh, no!
So who are you?
I did kill us. She thinks we’re dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
It’s barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
You knew him well?
He died before he could complete his lifelong dream.  I intend to finish it for him.
Yes.
Partially, yes.
I know.
Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.
A rope!
Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.
Of course...
Yes.  Au revoir...
Still no contact yet.
What?!
Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.
Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
Not yet, there's plenty of time.
Mm hmm.
You -- you know about me and Dan?
Always.  Ever since the day I died.
Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I'll be alone.  You're the last human being I'll ever see.
You're the only human being I care for.
The south pole.  Time¹s flowing backwards.
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
The missing scientists.
Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
Maybe not, but why take chances?
His . . . whatever.
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
Old?
The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?
What do you mean, frame-up?
Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
No.  We laid out very careful ground rules --
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.
Fate of the world at stake, Adrian.  Can't get too worked up over bad press.
Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
Why is that?
Good thing you were there to save the day. Come walk with me.
That's too bad. I thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge.
Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
I know, poison needles in my shins. You've got 36 hours. Peace, out.
Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.
So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
That's exactly why we need them.
Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that?
What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
What do you get if you finish?
Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.
Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.
Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now.
Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.
A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them.
It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
I'm through, Xander.
You're serious?
You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?
Why you dogging me up?
Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
